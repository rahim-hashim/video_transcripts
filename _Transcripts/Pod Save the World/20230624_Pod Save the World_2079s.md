# Vladimir Putin Faces Military Coup within Russia from Prigozhin's Mercenary Wagner Group
**Pod Save the World:** [June 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ)
*  Welcome back to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Ben Rhodes and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=0.0s)]
*  We are back here. It's Saturday afternoon. We're recording a mini episode [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  I don't even to call it Ben because it's been a pretty wild 24 hours in Russia. You and I were texting [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  In the midst of this ongoing sort of maybe coup it might be over [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=15.24s)]
*  We'll explain in a second that this is one of the crazier things [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=19.18s)]
*  I think either of us had seen in foreign policy in our lives [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=21.64s)]
*  Yeah, Russia's having a total normal one, Tommy [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=26.44s)]
*  We said at the beginning of this war in February 22nd when you launched a major war [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=30.64s)]
*  You never know what's gonna happen and Putin didn't bargain for this. But here we are. No, he certainly didn't [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=35.7s)]
*  Okay, so here's what happened [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=41.24s)]
*  so on Friday a man named Evgeny Prigozhin who is the founder of the Wagner mercenary group and [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=42.24s)]
*  Russian oligarch and in once a close ally Vladimir Putin [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=49.36s)]
*  decided to take his private army of about 25,000 men who had been fighting in Ukraine and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=53.24s)]
*  Turn them against the Russian state [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=58.8s)]
*  Prigozhin he's been engaged in this fierce war of words and a power struggle with Russia's military leadership for months [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=62.31999999999999s)]
*  He blames them for not having enough ammunition. He attacks them in really personal terms in these videos. He releases all the time [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=69.6s)]
*  But he says it seems like what made him finally snap and literally declare war on the Russian Ministry of Defense [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=76.84s)]
*  Was an alleged missile strike on a Wagner camp in Ukraine [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=83.24s)]
*  That Wagner said killed a bunch of their guys and was ordered by the Russian military leadership [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=87.48s)]
*  I say alleged because everyone involved in the story is a liar and Prigozhin could have made it all up as a pretext [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=92.16s)]
*  We don't know but that's what he said [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=98.24s)]
*  So early Saturday morning [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=100.36s)]
*  We started to see videos of these Wagner forces rolling tanks and other heavy equipment into [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=102.56s)]
*  The Russian city of Rostov where they seize control of military facilities. These are very important military facilities [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=107.92s)]
*  In staging operations for the war in Ukraine for the Russian military the Wagner forces then started rolling their equipment towards Moscow [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=115.16s)]
*  And you know Moscow wanted some sort of lockdown mode [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=124.0s)]
*  It's not totally clear to me been how much combat occurred along the way there were reports of Wagner forces [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  Maybe shooting down Russian helicopters. There was active fighting along this highway where the the convoy was traveling [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=133.28s)]
*  But it didn't seem like there was none [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=139.92s)]
*  Putin had to come out and give a speech [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=142.79999999999998s)]
*  He called it an armed rebellion and a stab in the back of our country and our people [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=144.89999999999998s)]
*  Shortly before we started recording this [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=150.2s)]
*  Prigozhin got on the phone with Bella Russian President Alexander Lukashenko and they negotiated a deal and [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=152.72s)]
*  Announced that he would be standing down and turning the Wagner columns [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=159.79999999999998s)]
*  Back to Ukraine and returning to their field camps according to the plan [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=163.92s)]
*  Putin's spokesman then released a statement saying that the criminal case against Prigozhin will be closed [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=167.48000000000002s)]
*  He'll go into exile in Belarus and he'll offer amnesty for all the other Wagner forces involved in light of their service in Ukraine [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=172.36s)]
*  And it does seem like then that Wagner will be swallowed up into the Russian military more formally now [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=179.72s)]
*  So that's sort of the overview of what happened [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=185.32s)]
*  we asked [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=188.88s)]
*  the folks and our friends at the pod discord community to submit some questions to do sort of a Q&A to help [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=190.36s)]
*  You know answer answer everybody's questions about what the hell is happening [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=195.76s)]
*  If you want to join the discord by the way go to crooked comm slash friends [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=199.28s)]
*  But Ben before we get to the Q&A was there anything sort of at the top that you wanted to just touch on no [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=202.98s)]
*  I think that's a really good summary [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=206.76s)]
*  I think the only thing I'd add to just kind of the baseline facts here is that after Prigozhin launched this [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=207.76s)]
*  partial coup [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=214.44s)]
*  The city of Rostov that they took control over. This is a city in southern Russia that is near the border of Ukraine [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=216.18s)]
*  Importantly it is literally the logistics hub for the war in Ukraine [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=223.56s)]
*  So a lot of the supply lines that run into Ukraine run through the city of Rostov [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=227.76000000000002s)]
*  So it was not a small thing that [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=232.24s)]
*  Prigozhin took control of the city to control of the Russian military headquarters in the city because essentially that gave him [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=235.12s)]
*  Control over the choke point that leads into Ukraine [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=241.88s)]
*  Back in when I was in government 2014 2015 [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=246.0s)]
*  We saw this as a staging area for all of the support or a lot of the support at least that went into so-called [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=248.82s)]
*  Pro-russian separatists and some of the Russian military advisors who went in that's obviously expanded with this war [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=255.06s)]
*  So Prigozhin really did have a choke hold on [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=259.7s)]
*  The ability of the Russian military to project power in Ukraine and it also gave him a great platform to make a run on [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=262.78s)]
*  Moscow what she was doing until he stood down. Yeah, we should say Evgeny Prigozhin. He's a Russian oligarch [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=268.53999999999996s)]
*  He went to prison for about nine years in the 80s for a robbery [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=274.3s)]
*  He then became he reportedly opened a hot dog stand became a caterer got to know Putin through that catering work [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=278.14000000000004s)]
*  I think there's actually a photo of Prigozhin putting a plate in front of George HW Bush [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=285.5s)]
*  When he's at a meeting with Putin then but he's built the Wagner group into this pretty amazing [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=290.22s)]
*  Like large fighting force since 2014. I think they first showed up in Crimea, but they have grown their operations since then they're in Syria [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=296.94s)]
*  They fought in Libya Sudan Mali Mozambique [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=304.94s)]
*  The US sanctioned Prigozhin in 2016 for the annexation of Crimea and the US indicted him in 2018 [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=307.98s)]
*  on election interference charges because he oversaw the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=314.90000000000003s)]
*  IRA the sort of troll farms that were part of spreading disinformation in our elections. So [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=319.14000000000004s)]
*  Very well known bad guy is the long story short here. So Ben [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=326.18s)]
*  First question was from Matt who said, you know, what's the background build up to this? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=331.46000000000004s)]
*  You know, basically is this airstrike more of an excuse or the sole motivation? Do you have thoughts on this one? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=337.98s)]
*  Yeah [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=344.66s)]
*  we've been talking about this on the pod off and on for the last few months because what's been happening is Prigozhin for the [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=345.06s)]
*  last several months has been increasingly airing his grievances about the Russian military command structure and in particular the Russian Minister of Defense [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=352.5s)]
*  Shorgu and the other military commanders because what was going on is it Prigozhin who had been off like you said projecting power abroad [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=360.34000000000003s)]
*  in places like Syria and parts of Africa came back at the beginning of the war [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=367.98s)]
*  He built an even larger fighting force in Wagner usually has estimates are that they had up to [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=372.02000000000004s)]
*  25,000 fighters associated with Wagner [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=377.68s)]
*  Some of these were hardened mercenaries that had fought in places like Syria [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=379.90000000000003s)]
*  Some of these were literally convicts that they took out of prison and threw at the front lines [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=383.3s)]
*  Prigozhin was at the front in the place called Bakhmut that we've talked about a lot [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=388.62s)]
*  This is a Ukrainian city that was the focus of fighting for several months and it was Wagner fighters who were on the front lines [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=393.14000000000004s)]
*  in that fight for Bakhmut and increasingly what Prigozhin was alleging in [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=400.1s)]
*  Telegram videos and other communications is that the Russian military was hanging him out to dry that they weren't giving him sufficient cover [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=405.54s)]
*  They weren't giving him sufficient ammunition that essentially his men were being treated as cannon fodder [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=413.06s)]
*  Even though they were the ones who were making gains in Bakhmut and then obviously Russia was able to complete the conquest of Bakhmut [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=418.1s)]
*  Which is frankly not that important strategic city, but it came very important symbolically [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=424.5s)]
*  Prigozhin kind of announced the conquering of Bakhmut and he clearly wanted to use that for some prestige [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=429.06s)]
*  But he was threatening to do something maybe not this dramatic but something quite dramatic for some time [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=434.70000000000005s)]
*  Because he basically had this beef with the Russian military command structure and the way Putin set up this whole [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=440.74s)]
*  Enterprise of his regime is you have the military which is corrupt then you have guys like Prigozhin who is also corrupt [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=447.06s)]
*  You have other warlords like Ramzan Kadyrov the Chechen warlord [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=453.1s)]
*  And they're kind of competing fiefdoms and what happened is Putin thought he could control these different factions through the war [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=457.26s)]
*  Turns out he couldn't and that all exploded into you know view for the entire world the last 24 hours [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=464.1s)]
*  like you said we don't know if [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=470.38s)]
*  Prigozhin used a pretext of a [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=472.22s)]
*  An airstrike on Wagner whether that strike actually took place, but this had been building for some time [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=474.26s)]
*  But I don't think most analysts thought that it would get this far in this hot and it did [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=479.38s)]
*  Yeah, and a lot of you know analysts suggest that Putin allows these sort of mini fiefdoms the Wagner group to exist [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=484.54s)]
*  he builds up the Chechens as a way to [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=492.1s)]
*  create you know rivalries between [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=495.58s)]
*  People who rely on him to make sure that the military isn't a threat to his personal power because it's obviously the most powerful entity [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=498.58s)]
*  Within the state and then benched a couple other things on the kind of buildup like as you mentioned [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=505.62s)]
*  Prigozhin's been talking shit about the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=511.09999999999997s)]
*  Ministry of Defense for months there was a weird moment a few weeks back where he threatened to withdraw troops from Bakhmut before walking that back [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=513.3s)]
*  There was also an incident where the Wagner forces released a video of some Russian soldier [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=520.5799999999999s)]
*  They've clearly just beaten the shit out of sit confessing in air quotes to shooting at Wagner forces and then [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=525.4599999999999s)]
*  More recently the deputy defense minister announced that all volunteer attachments would have to sign contracts with the minister [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=532.02s)]
*  Ministry of Defense before the end of this month [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=539.3s)]
*  This was obviously seen as a way to kind of exert more control over Wagner and put them under the MOD and [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=541.3s)]
*  Prigozhin flipped out about that because obviously that would take away a lot of his power and he snapped on the defense minister [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=548.14s)]
*  So yeah again, no idea if this airstrike really happened who did it if it was a pretext, but certainly that was [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=554.44s)]
*  this precipitating event [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=561.1600000000001s)]
*  Rolling on Moscow. I mean the irony is you said he has competing futile [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=563.24s)]
*  So no one got too strong and I think the main takeaway here is that [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=566.8800000000001s)]
*  You know Prigozhin came pretty close to Moscow. We controlled the city of Roshan [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=570.8000000000001s)]
*  So it shows that that that theory may not have held for Putin [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=574.84s)]
*  Because this is a guy who got pretty close [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=579.44s)]
*  And I think what Prigozhin may have been counting on is he wanted to test if other people would come with him [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=581.44s)]
*  You know what parts of the army peel off and join him what other Russian leaders? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=586.32s)]
*  Provincial leaders maybe join them. They didn't so it may be and no one really knows exactly what happened here [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=590.8000000000001s)]
*  But it may be that Prigozhin was testing to see if there was kind of a broader collapse and might have allowed him to make [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=596.24s)]
*  A real challenge when that didn't happen. Maybe he took the best deal he could get so Ben poop Jackson asks [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=601.4000000000001s)]
*  Are these reports not not scoop wait isn't there like the the basketball player scoot yeah, not scoot [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=608.98s)]
*  Scoop Jackson was a senator, right? Oh, that's right. I'm thinking the senator. Yeah, this is I'm such a nerd scoop [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=615.82s)]
*  Jackson's a senator not the best [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=622.08s)]
*  Look, maybe it's both. So poop Jackson wants to know, you know about this this report that there was a deal cut between [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=624.4200000000001s)]
*  Prigozhin and Putin [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=630.82s)]
*  This was allegedly brokered by Alexander Lukashenko [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=632.74s)]
*  The Belarussian president so I think question is like, you know on the legitimacy [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=636.86s)]
*  Is this deal real? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=642.7s)]
*  Again, like these people are all liars Russia is awash in disinformation [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=644.54s)]
*  The Ukrainians are probably putting out all kinds of disinformation, right? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=648.66s)]
*  I saw there they're they're doing their kind of trolling thing at the moment [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=652.14s)]
*  They released a video of some drone commander like eating a bunch of popcorn [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=654.86s)]
*  I saw as a Lensky put out a video talking about how weak this made Putin look like we obviously can't predict the future here [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=658.94s)]
*  I would not be surprised if [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=665.62s)]
*  Prigozhin fell out of the window of a tall building in Belarus in the near future [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=667.94s)]
*  I just sort of can't imagine Putin tolerating him literally marching troops on Moscow and then living but I'm curious what you make of [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=672.54s)]
*  Lukashenko the president of Belarus's role here [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=681.74s)]
*  Why is this guy of all people calling the head of the Wagner group and ending, you know [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=684.26s)]
*  The negotiated the end of an insurrection. Well, Lukashenko another guy we've talked about a bunch, right? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=690.1800000000001s)]
*  He's the dictator of Belarus [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=694.5s)]
*  But he was almost toppled after a stolen election and basically became totally dependent Vladimir Putin [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=695.7800000000001s)]
*  And he's kind of a vassal state of Putin a lot of the staging for the initial invasion came through Belarus [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=702.26s)]
*  You know Lukashenko occasionally flies over and kisses Putin's ring [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=707.94s)]
*  So he's you know, he should be thought of as another fiefdom because Belarus is almost de facto controlled by Moscow now [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=711.38s)]
*  Why is he in this picture? It may be that they needed somewhere to send Prigozhin [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=719.3000000000001s)]
*  and Belarus is someplace that's not in Russia, but is [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=724.7800000000001s)]
*  Barely controlled easy commute. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's a commuter. He's got his own relationship with Krugosian [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=728.4200000000001s)]
*  I'm sure Wagner guys have been part of the infrastructure that has propped up Lukashenko [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=733.82s)]
*  So it may be that he was a convenient lackey [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=738.94s)]
*  To carry this out [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=741.7s)]
*  it may be that he was a [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=743.3000000000001s)]
*  Genuine person who could be a broker because he's not in the literal Russian command structure [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=745.0600000000001s)]
*  So it would have been harder for someone say in the Russian government to broker this [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=750.62s)]
*  So he was kind of a convenient third party [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=754.94s)]
*  I think an interesting one though in a way it boosters both the bolsters Lucas Shenko's prestige a bit [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=757.46s)]
*  And you saw him trying to do that. They're the ones who announced it the the Lukashenko office [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=762.94s)]
*  They're the way they read out that they had a call with Putin before I think Putin did [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=767.34s)]
*  So first of all for Lukashenko this kind of makes him look like a slightly bigger strong man [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=770.98s)]
*  Even though everybody knows he's under Putin's thumb. We'll see if prugosian a [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=775.88s)]
*  Actually goes to Belarus because he could you know, maybe hop down to Africa where Wagner has some infrastructure [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=780.48s)]
*  Be like you said whether he gets pushed out a window at this point again. This could be everything from you know a [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=786.36s)]
*  coup that almost succeeded and [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=794.4s)]
*  Ultimately, the guy took the easy way out the parachute into Belarus when he realized that the House of Cards wasn't fully collapsing in Russia [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=796.84s)]
*  That's when under the spectrum you could take it all the way together in the spectrum that this is some Russian [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=803.96s)]
*  Information operation right like we don't exactly know but what is clear here is that they are trying to signal a de-escalation [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=808.8399999999999s)]
*  That is going to change what Wagner was into something that is to some extent brought into the Russian command structure [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=816.56s)]
*  It will be interesting to see if there are any changes made in the Ministry of Defense command structure because one of per Goshen's [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=823.76s)]
*  You know [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=830.92s)]
*  Grievances was you got to change the guy at the top shoygu the minister of defense who he said was incompetent [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=832.12s)]
*  If there are changes made at the Ministry of Defense that might show that actually per Goshen, you know accomplish something [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=836.48s)]
*  Be beyond just flexing here. It'd be interesting to see if Wagner stays under per Goshen's control with its global operations [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=843.44s)]
*  So there's a lot of stuff to watch here [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=850.1600000000001s)]
*  But yes in the near term this seems like a deal that per Goshen doesn't you know gets the charges dropped against and the Wagner guys [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=851.8000000000001s)]
*  Get to go back some of them will go in the Russian military [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=858.44s)]
*  Some of them will leave and we'll see how this all shakes out [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=860.88s)]
*  There's a lot of turns in this story that are yet to come. Yeah in Putin [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=863.28s)]
*  I think over time is has struggled to put his guys in charge of the Ministry of Defense [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=868.0s)]
*  The one of those previous heads tried this modernization effort that failed show you clearly is not [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=873.64s)]
*  Really had the firmest grip on control. Maybe Bob Gates is available then. I don't know what he's up to these days [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=880.32s)]
*  Spiffy asks what's it like in the White House during these times is everyone on high alert? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=885.72s)]
*  I don't know if you've been a year on East Coast [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=890.76s)]
*  I was texting with people on the NSC at like midnight Eastern last night [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=892.92s)]
*  So I'm sure they were at the office very late and back early in the morning [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=897.76s)]
*  but the crazy thing about a situation like this is [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=901.5600000000001s)]
*  You're probably gonna get as much information from social media as you are from the intelligence community [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=904.28s)]
*  You know [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=908.82s)]
*  Like I don't know that the CIA is like can be able to wrangle their sources such as they exist in [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=909.08s)]
*  Russia in real time to figure out what the Wagner group is doing unless like per Goshen is some sort of asset [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=914.4000000000001s)]
*  I imagine they were like, you know satellites watching troop movements and whatnot and you know siggant of [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=919.48s)]
*  people in the Russian government talking about what was going on and [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=925.84s)]
*  But you know, the most compelling stuff that I've seen was just getting uploaded to Telegram and other social media sites [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=930.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting. I mean, you know, what is it like? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=935.36s)]
*  I mean the rhythm I remember for instance around the [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=938.2s)]
*  First Russian move into Crimea or and all the turns that happened in Ukraine after that right is that [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=940.6s)]
*  You get called into an emergency situation room meeting that is chaired by the National Security Advisor [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=946.72s)]
*  So you go into the you go into the situation room and there you've got the Secretary of State Secretary of Defense [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=951.84s)]
*  CIA director everybody is around the table or on a secure video conference the intelligence community asked [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=956.96s)]
*  What the fuck is going on and they're like briefing? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=963.2600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so in this case the director of national intelligence after Haynes and the director of the CIA Bill Burns probably are making [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=966.1s)]
*  Presentations here's what we know. Here's we don't know then you go around to Lloyd Austin the security defense and you say [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=972.3000000000001s)]
*  What are you seeing in terms of Russian troop movements? What are you seeing in terms of Wagner troop movements? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=978.0200000000001s)]
*  Then you go to Tony Blinken the Secretary of State and you say hey Tony, what's the diplomatic play? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=983.22s)]
*  What have you learned from your contacts with the Ukrainians? What have you learned from our embassy? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=987.58s)]
*  Maybe you go out to the ambassador on a security conference [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=991.42s)]
*  And so you're trying to get a full picture here the intelligence picture the military picture the diplomatic picture [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=994.22s)]
*  And then trying to figure out what the play is what can we do in response? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=999.86s)]
*  Is there anything we need to do in response the White House chose a low profile here? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1003.1s)]
*  Which I think is right because we didn't probably know exactly what was happening [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1007.58s)]
*  So you didn't see Biden go out and make a statement you saw him make some phone calls to the British the French the Germans the key [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1011.14s)]
*  Allies, I'm sure that Tony Blinken was on the phone constantly with the Ukrainians [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1016.88s)]
*  Jake Sullivan was supposed to go to Copenhagen to meet with a bunch of countries that have been like fence hitters in the war [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1020.7800000000001s)]
*  He canceled that trip mark Milley the chairman the Joint Chiefs of Staff was supposed to go to the Middle East [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1026.06s)]
*  He canceled that trip to me. That's a signal that this was a surprise to them as everybody when you start pulling down travel like that [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1030.82s)]
*  What I'd like to know Tommy and this is you and I were texting about this last night is the Ukrainian [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1038.8600000000001s)]
*  Intelligence services I think are really good, you know [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1043.3400000000001s)]
*  And I think they're kind of in the Russian heads and I'm sure that they were stirring this pot for weeks or months [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1046.02s)]
*  In terms of creating information operations to make the distrust between Wagner and the military grow. Definitely, you know, I'm curious what [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1051.46s)]
*  The Ukrainians were sharing with us, you know about what they were seeing what they were doing [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1060.34s)]
*  But yeah, you're just it's it's actually I miss being in the White House very rarely [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1066.02s)]
*  So yeah likes to have a life and has two kids the times I miss it the most are when there's a crisis because [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1071.8999999999999s)]
*  It's there's like a frenetic pace [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1077.62s)]
*  But you're learning stuff every 30 minutes and you're you're doing stuff constantly and and I'm sure that nobody has slept in the last 24 hours [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1079.82s)]
*  Yeah, the most fascinating part about a crisis is the sort of the information flows [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1087.46s)]
*  Open widely right and things that were like, you know closely held or sensitive intelligence or [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1094.78s)]
*  Background on things get shared more broadly because you just need to figure it out and it might be in the press [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1100.3799999999999s)]
*  anyway, I imagine been that a big part of the [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1104.1799999999998s)]
*  NSC conversation about managing to the extent we can at all what's happening in Russia is [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1108.6599999999999s)]
*  Telling everyone to shut the fuck up because what Vladimir Putin loves to do is take any little statement [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1116.06s)]
*  You know some moderate criticism of [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1123.04s)]
*  You know an election or whatever it might be like you did to Hillary Clinton back in the day and then try to make [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1126.8400000000001s)]
*  This about you know a Western plot to take him down or some sort of coup and like he might do that anyway [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1131.72s)]
*  But you don't want to give him any ammunition to to sort of hang that on. Yeah, you don't you know now [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1137.24s)]
*  Purgosian is the last guy that you could call a Western asset [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1143.44s)]
*  But you know Putin's on above anything to say that this is a Western plot [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1146.68s)]
*  But it's also the case said like look for for guys like us like we can go on Twitter way in [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1149.98s)]
*  You know, you don't want to be wrong either, you know [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1156.1000000000001s)]
*  Like you don't want to when you don't know what's happening and you know what's going to happen and I don't think anyone [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1159.26s)]
*  Knew what was happening last night. I don't think Vladimir Putin knew what was happening last night [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1164.6200000000001s)]
*  I don't think Purgosian knew exactly what's gonna happen [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1168.46s)]
*  You also just want to hold your powder until you have more information, right? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1170.8600000000001s)]
*  So you don't want to play in the Putin's hands and you also don't want to come out and you know declare a victory [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1175.78s)]
*  Whatever that is or like start calling, you know [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1182.1s)]
*  You don't know you were the communications person on the front lines [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1185.4s)]
*  Like you don't become the narrator of what's happening in Russia when you don't know exactly what's happening [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1188.26s)]
*  so I think if people are wondering well, where was Biden why aren't they talking more like [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1192.7s)]
*  Like better to wait and see and then go out and say your piece another question [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1197.74s)]
*  We got was, you know, what does this say about the strength of the Putin regime? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1201.58s)]
*  And his sort of image in the country [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1204.42s)]
*  It does seem clear that this is the biggest threat to Putin's power since 1999 when he became president, right? [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1207.66s)]
*  His whole image is to be like the strong man and the father of the country [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1215.0600000000002s)]
*  But he had to go out and give this grave speech [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1220.0600000000002s)]
*  about a coup attempt [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1223.98s)]
*  You've got Purgosian by the way messaging that the whole war itself the war in Ukraine was waged [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1226.8600000000001s)]
*  Under false pretenses by the MOD they're saying Purgosian was saying Russia was losing that [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1234.3s)]
*  Bureaucrats in the Ministry of Defense are stealing all the money for the war [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1239.3s)]
*  That's why we evaded you've got like the FSB putting out statements calling on Wagner to take per Goshen captive, right? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1242.54s)]
*  The whole country is freaking out about a coup attempt [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1249.34s)]
*  They're digging up roads on the way to Moscow to block tanks from rolling into this one [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1251.7s)]
*  like it is [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1256.42s)]
*  It has to undercut Putin's image and in in his argument that the invasion somehow [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1257.94s)]
*  You know made the country Russia safer from the fascists in Ukraine, right? [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1264.5s)]
*  100% Tommy. I mean like first of all, this was real [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1268.7800000000002s)]
*  So Putin had to go on television and talk to the whole nation. So this isn't something they could hide [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1272.74s)]
*  Putin told everybody this was happening, right? [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1278.52s)]
*  So this is something that they can't just sweep under the rug second [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1280.98s)]
*  They were like tanks in Moscow, you know, they were military vehicles in Moscow. They were kind of taking emergency measures. So for Russians [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1285.76s)]
*  They saw the war coming home in a way that they haven't seen before [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1293.88s)]
*  They felt an instability that they haven't felt before [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1298.16s)]
*  And and so even though this ended pretty quickly [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1301.76s)]
*  Don't think for a second that the Russian population is thinking about Putin the same way today that they did 48 hours ago [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1305.32s)]
*  He has been dealt a blow [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1312.52s)]
*  There is a big crack in the edifice of the the Putin regime even with the way this ended [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1314.0400000000002s)]
*  And by the way, the fact that it didn't end the way he said it would right he said that you know [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1319.5600000000002s)]
*  We're you like you said the FSB said to detain progocian [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1325.24s)]
*  They put out a statement saying he was gonna go to jail for 20 years the fact that even though Putin held power [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1328.68s)]
*  You know progocian was given amnesty and that there was a deal announced by Lukashenko of Belarus, right? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1336.0800000000002s)]
*  That's not what Putin told people was gonna happen when he went on television and that makes him look weaker, too [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1341.5800000000002s)]
*  And so to me even though this didn't end with like a civil war and tanks in fighting in Moscow [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1348.28s)]
*  It does kind of feel like the beginning of maybe not the end but the beginning of a different [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1356.54s)]
*  Period of time where Vladimir Putin has to worry more about his personal security because that there are people in that system [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1363.3400000000001s)]
*  That are strong like progocian who now they're thinking hey, maybe I'll take my shot, you know [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1369.5s)]
*  Putin's gonna have to start worrying about that in a way that he didn't before who's the next person who might take a run? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1377.82s)]
*  The Wagner guys based on reports were like a hundred and twenty five miles from Moscow, you know [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1383.3s)]
*  This was this was not a fire close, right? [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1389.08s)]
*  And so I do think he's he's he's weaker across the board [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1391.8999999999999s)]
*  The other thing I'd say is the whole world saw this right? So there are all these fence-sitting countries we've talked about India [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1395.66s)]
*  Brazil the whole continent or most of the continent of Africa [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1402.22s)]
*  The Chinese who've been betting on Putin they're looking at this and thinking like hey does this guy really have control over this thing? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1406.0600000000002s)]
*  and so I think the [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1412.66s)]
*  pressure on Putin from within and maybe even from without to [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1414.74s)]
*  Kind of pull back the war in Ukraine where the Ukrainians are on the counter offensive [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1418.6200000000001s)]
*  And and to try to get his shit together at home is gonna go up [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1423.06s)]
*  So I think he leaves this like a pretty significantly diminished figure [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1426.5s)]
*  Yeah, it was also interesting to see that there were some images coming out of the Wagner forces [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1430.3799999999999s)]
*  Sort of packing up and getting back in their trucks and going back to the front lines and they were surrounded by citizens [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1436.5s)]
*  Applauding them and cheering for them, right? So like these guys aren't seen as enemies. They didn't not seem like they did anything wrong [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1441.9799999999998s)]
*  They're still seemingly beloved now, you know [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1446.62s)]
*  Lest we're sort of leading an oppression that this is the beginning of the end for Putin [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1449.66s)]
*  I mean, you know Ben the counter argument would be Taya Berdawan in Turkey, right? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1453.74s)]
*  Who fought off a coup attempt in 2016 and then just cracked down brutally on everyone and further cemented his control [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1457.98s)]
*  So I guess a lot of it depends on Putin's reaction, but obviously different situations different systems [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1465.06s)]
*  yeah, but you know you said something really important about pergogian's criticism of the war because [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1469.42s)]
*  To date pergogian's criticisms were about the incompetence of the Ministry of Defense [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1474.46s)]
*  The corruption of the Ministry of Defense the prosecution of the war he went at the core rationale [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1478.62s)]
*  This whole thing is a bunch of bullshit and we've always wondered about Russian public opinion [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1483.6599999999999s)]
*  those pictures of people kind of cheering them like [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1488.58s)]
*  He may have been the first guy to say out loud like what the fuck is going on [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1491.62s)]
*  The Emperor has no clothes, you know [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1495.12s)]
*  And if he's now saying the quiet part out loud if he's saying something that everybody's kind of feeling [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1496.78s)]
*  From the frontline troops are being treated like cannon fodder and the people back home are losing loved ones to people who were just [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1501.94s)]
*  Wondering like what the fuck is going on? [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1507.8600000000001s)]
*  It's hard to put that genie back in a bottle too. And it's it'll be interesting to see the boy this goes like you said [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1509.98s)]
*  Doesn't mean Putin's gonna topple tomorrow and frankly he may become more bulletin and more brutal and more extreme [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1515.94s)]
*  But this is not going his way. We're you know, history is long and we're only like what 16 months into this war [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1522.38s)]
*  Yeah, where are we gonna be in 60 months from now? I would not be buying stock and Vladimir Putin right now [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1528.9s)]
*  No, I would neither and you know watching all this unfold [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1534.66s)]
*  Reminded me. I think it was that big Atlantic cover piece on Ukraine that said something like, you know [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1538.14s)]
*  Look anybody we better than Putin and I think this what we just watch is a pretty good example of how flawed that thinking is [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1543.96s)]
*  right, like [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1551.0600000000002s)]
*  Purgotians a bad guy [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1552.02s)]
*  He's a crazy person a chaotic civil war in Russia with a mercenary forces and a bunch of nukes floating around like actually that is [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1553.5s)]
*  Probably worse than Putin kind of locking that shit down or at least having control [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1561.06s)]
*  Well, I yeah this to tie it back to the question about what's going on the White House [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1565.18s)]
*  I bet you that the nuclear weapons were a big topic of focus in the Situation Room [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1569.62s)]
*  Because if there is a civil war in Russia [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1574.58s)]
*  This is the largest nuclear power with the United States in the world [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1576.94s)]
*  Who had control those nuclear weapons? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1581.4199999999998s)]
*  What if there was a war in the Wagner group splinter the military and the Wagner group had some nuclear weapons and the Russian military had [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1583.34s)]
*  some nuclear weapons like just because we don't like Putin and [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1589.86s)]
*  We all would like to see something different than Vladimir Putin in Russia [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1593.7s)]
*  Doesn't mean that like a civil war is necessarily good [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1597.06s)]
*  If you have loose nuclear weapons [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1600.54s)]
*  Then the stakes suddenly become existential [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1602.86s)]
*  I think that the big picture question is and maybe it's unanswerable is what does this mean for the war in Ukraine itself? [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1606.02s)]
*  I saw reports that the Ukrainians have launched or at least said they launched some additional kind of military [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1612.78s)]
*  Offensive in the midst of all this chaos seemingly to try to take advantage of it [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1619.3s)]
*  I don't know how you know impactful that will be. I don't know the impact really of these [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1623.42s)]
*  Wagner forces being off the battlefield for a period of time or whether they might end up demoralized or you know [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1631.4599999999998s)]
*  I think long story short [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1637.04s)]
*  We probably should not expect that these events will lead to some sort of game-changing [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1638.2199999999998s)]
*  Military effort in the next couple weeks or two [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1644.5s)]
*  It'll probably continue to be a grinding long-term assault this Ukrainian counter offensive [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1646.82s)]
*  But I don't know I didn't know if you had thoughts on sort of that broader question [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1651.1399999999999s)]
*  I think that there's like a couple of aspects to this and it's a good question [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1654.86s)]
*  One is is the Russian military [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1659.5s)]
*  Distracted by this or demoralized by this in a way that allows the Ukrainians to make some more headway [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1663.78s)]
*  Or are they not right there dug in there their trenches just things like that that they can use for defensive purposes [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1670.5s)]
*  The second is the Wagner fighters themselves who've been you know, pretty good as a part of the Russian [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1675.8999999999999s)]
*  Campaign here if they're that's taken off the table for the Russians. Does that harm their [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1682.24s)]
*  Ability to prosecute the war and then just Putin's own mindset. Does it become kind of consumed by internal stability? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1688.38s)]
*  He was a bit exposed in Moscow [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1695.66s)]
*  Because there's so many Russian military deployments into Ukraine [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1698.5400000000002s)]
*  Does he have to pull people back now because he's worried about internal stability [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1701.5800000000002s)]
*  Are there units that have to kind of come back and protect Moscow like a kind of presidential guard here? [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1705.7s)]
*  So there are a lot of questions, but none of them are really good for Putin [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1710.94s)]
*  Nobody's gonna say like well, this is good for Putin like [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1715.02s)]
*  We'll see how it goes to the Ukrainian counter-offensive in the weeks and months to come, but I have to think that on some level [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1718.1000000000001s)]
*  Whether it's all of those scenarios Wagner off the battlefield Russian military distracted morale issues [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1724.6200000000001s)]
*  That that this is probably not good for for the Russian military war in Ukraine. Yeah agreed with that [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1731.5s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think that's it for today. We have been [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1738.38s)]
*  For a long time actually have been producing and thinking about doing a longer segment on the Wagner group with cricket contributor Max Fisher [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1742.66s)]
*  And we'll get into you know, sort of all the things they're doing in Africa [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1749.46s)]
*  And what the impact could be? [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1753.42s)]
*  on you know those efforts there and you know the way that Russia's used the Wagner group to [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1755.42s)]
*  Screw with other countries all over the globe [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1760.06s)]
*  But we just want to say, you know [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1762.06s)]
*  Thanks everybody for listening to this and thanks to the friends of the pod discord community for sending in really great questions [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1763.82s)]
*  And being fun to goof around with in these times on discord [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1769.58s)]
*  So if you want to join crooked comm slash friends Ben, I don't know if you have any concluding thoughts [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1773.26s)]
*  Otherwise, we will end the YouTube first of all the discord channel is great. I don't know if we don't have any leakers on there [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1779.02s)]
*  Did I know but documents guys? [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1785.7s)]
*  I mean wait, but that was sarcasm sarcasm. Yeah legally that was [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1790.8999999999999s)]
*  I guess the one thing I'd say is [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1794.8999999999999s)]
*  You know, it's easy when these things are playing out on like Twitter, you know [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1799.54s)]
*  And I was all I've been off Twitter for most of the last few months [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1803.34s)]
*  But last night, you know, you're every like watching everything they can get [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1806.86s)]
*  It's easy to play armchair [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1810.78s)]
*  genius historian [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1813.18s)]
*  And I'm not trying to do that here because like it's important to note that like we don't know a lot [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1814.6599999999999s)]
*  We you know, these are personality dynamics. These are like you said, they're all liars. They're all corrupt [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1819.42s)]
*  There are no good guys here. I [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1824.86s)]
*  Guess the one historical point that is worth making [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1827.26s)]
*  and it just kind of lurks in the background of all this is that [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1831.4199999999998s)]
*  Things have happened in Russia in the past pretty fast, you know [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1836.4599999999998s)]
*  So the Soviet Union collapsed pretty quickly and there was a coup a bunch of strong men tried to house Gorbachev [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1840.9399999999998s)]
*  To hold on to power that only lasted like a bunch of days and then those guys were out [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1848.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeltsin standing on the tank whole thing like the one of the strongest empires in the history of world just like implodes [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1853.1799999999998s)]
*  relatively quickly [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1859.2199999999998s)]
*  1917 the Bolsheviks Lenin Trotsky all those guys [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1861.4199999999998s)]
*  They weren't that much stronger than Wagner group, you know, they didn't like control a lot of forces [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1865.3s)]
*  They came to power pretty fast because the czar had fought like a shitty [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1869.82s)]
*  War in World War one and was losing and nobody liked him and it all kind of came down like a house of cards, right? [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1875.1799999999998s)]
*  Things you know, I'm not trying to sound you know [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1882.2s)]
*  like I know everything that's going on in the world and but like it is worth bearing in mind that [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1885.36s)]
*  Part of what we saw the last 24 hours, even though the most dramatic outcome didn't happen [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1890.2s)]
*  Is that we don't know what's gonna happen and things can change very fast and that Vladimir Putin just because he's been this strong [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1894.96s)]
*  Man for 20 years doesn't mean that you know [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1900.12s)]
*  He's gonna be around for that much longer or that he's somehow immune to the kind of forces that have toppled dictators before [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1902.96s)]
*  When you're flailing about and losing in a war and he's certainly not winning in the war and the Russians are suffering huge gains [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1909.76s)]
*  the vulnerability for this kind of thing goes up and so the lesson I take away from this is [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1917.7199999999998s)]
*  Whatever happens, however, this plane lands whatever plays out in the next few days [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1923.12s)]
*  I don't think we've seen the last one of these, you know [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1926.58s)]
*  I think that Russian internal stability is now a part of the war in Ukraine and [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1930.36s)]
*  On the one hand that seems like a good thing because we want the Ukrainians to get their territory back [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1937.4s)]
*  but on the other hand it raises a whole bunch of other questions about [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1942.6000000000001s)]
*  Russia Russia's [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1946.52s)]
*  Stability about Russia's nuclear weapons all the rest of it. So, you know [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1948.44s)]
*  Stay tuned [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1953.52s)]
*  You know this this will play out over over a period of months probably years [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1955.1200000000001s)]
*  But you know, it's not just Ukraine's internal dynamic and borders and territory and stability [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1959.72s)]
*  Take here the question of what the future of Russia is is a part of this war in Ukraine [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1966.32s)]
*  And I think that's what we just saw. Yeah, I keep thinking about those civilians applauding [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1971.24s)]
*  Wagner forces who just occupied their town and how little we know about public opinion in Russia [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1977.0s)]
*  and how quickly [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1984.92s)]
*  Public opinion can change and you know, we know Putin fears nothing more than a color revolution [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1987.0s)]
*  Well, you know a war that's going really badly is the kind of thing that could lead to one and as we saw in the [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1992.0800000000002s)]
*  Arab Spring spring those things move quickly [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=1998.38s)]
*  So yeah, pretty monumental couple days here, even if it ended what color what colors per Goshen? [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=2000.5600000000002s)]
*  What color do you think per Goshen is using? Oh [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=2006.72s)]
*  You know, he's so pale. He kind of looks like that like famous bat boy like tabloid cover, you know [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=2009.88s)]
*  He's like he's like a [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=2017.6000000000001s)]
*  Scarily compelling guy to stare at in like all these crazy videos he puts out, you know, he's yeah [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=2020.56s)]
*  He's a truly horrible person. He celebrates the fact that his [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=2025.9599999999998s)]
*  His guys kill deserters by hitting them in the head with sledgehammers. So that's just no that's the kind of person we're talking about [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=2029.8s)]
*  And he's the guy who kind of raised his hand to go into Syria and just massacre people [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=2036.9199999999998s)]
*  So this is this is a bad fucking dude the worst of the worst [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=2041.86s)]
*  They deserve each other [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=2045.8799999999999s)]
*  Well on that hopeful note [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=2047.68s)]
*  Recording on Tuesday for a pot on Wednesday. So thanks for tuning into this Ben. Good to see you and talk soon. See ya [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0UiMJsYtjQ&t=2051.32s)]
