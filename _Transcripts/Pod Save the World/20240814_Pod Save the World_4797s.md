# Ukraine's Military Invades Russia as Putin & The Kremlin Downplays It
**Pod Save the World:** [August 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo)
*  Welcome back to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Ben Rhodes. Ben, it's good to see ya. Yeah, I'm sorry. I [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm still COVID positive. That's okay. I'm just announcing that to the world, you know [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=6.28s)]
*  Is there a stigma to that anymore? I don't think so. I don't think so. It just kinda happens. We all have [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=9.6s)]
*  Gotten it not once twice three times. Who knows at this point. This is number two for me [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=14.8s)]
*  This is number two, but it's not pleasant. It's not pleasant and also just fucking lingers. It's hard to get rid of that thing [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=18.8s)]
*  I know I'm not even sick anymore, but I I don't want to get any of the Vitor children [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=23.44s)]
*  I appreciate that since uh, yeah, I did give it to my daughter, but the three-month-old so far he's doing okay [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=27.94s)]
*  I will say I missed you and I missed doing the show [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=33.94s)]
*  But to be honest all I want to talk about today is Robert F. Kennedy jr. And the dead bear carcass story [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=37.34s)]
*  I don't know if you guys did you not get a chance to podcast about that? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=43.74s)]
*  I did not and I was very sad because I've never laughed harder in my life than [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=46.66s)]
*  Watching Robert F. Kennedy jr. Is a little weird video that he put out himself where he's telling Roseanne Barr about [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=52.86s)]
*  throwing a dead baby bear in his car for some reason as a New Yorker to like the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=59.5s)]
*  Idea that it was just a normal thing to do after a steak dinner peer lawyers [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=64.82s)]
*  I mean, let's just actually let's can we spend a minute? Let's start at the beginning. Yeah, he was going falconing [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=68.78s)]
*  This is like what's what precipitates the whole story. He's going falconing and he sees a [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=73.4s)]
*  Dead bear cub on the side of the road so he pulls over to get it and here's what I struck by the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=77.66s)]
*  Logistics to Tommy because he gets it [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=83.22s)]
*  He has all these reasons why it's kind of litigious reasons why it's okay to like [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=85.42s)]
*  Eat bear and keep it chopped up in your fridge as if that's like a normal thing to do but then [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=89.98s)]
*  He goes to Peter Lugar's right great steak house super fancy famous iconic steak place for those. Yeah get the bacon appetizer. It's great [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=95.5s)]
*  Peter Lugar's is in Brooklyn. Okay? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=103.3s)]
*  Then he says he has a flight to catch which is presumably like Kennedy Airport, which is in Queens [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=105.78s)]
*  but [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=112.22s)]
*  He on the way to the airport is gonna take a massive detour into Central Park with a bunch of drunk guys, right? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=113.3s)]
*  And he wasn't he wasn't but he wasn't drinking course happens to have a bicycle that he's gonna get rid of [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=118.97999999999999s)]
*  With a bike in his car. How big is this car that you have a bike in a dead bear in the car at the same time? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=124.5s)]
*  What are you talking about dude and then just like staging a and first of all you can't [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=130.78s)]
*  Drive into Central Park. I don't know when this happened [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=135.86s)]
*  I mean because they banned cars in Central Park [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=138.14000000000001s)]
*  So did he get out of the car and walk the bear carcass in the bike in the park or what the hell's going on here? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=140.58s)]
*  Yeah, just like put it on the front on the little basket or something. Yeah, I couldn't possibly have more questions about this [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=145.78s)]
*  You know, I really couldn't and and then [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  former guest on [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=153.98000000000002s)]
*  crooked media podcast Tatiana Schlossberg [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=155.54s)]
*  wonderful reporter [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=158.72s)]
*  John F Kennedy's granddaughter wrote the article for the New York Times about the dead bear [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=160.48s)]
*  That was like the to me that was like the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=165.4s)]
*  Kicker the thing that just tipped it over the top and he's doing the thing that politicians always think they can do when a bad [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=167.88s)]
*  Story is coming which is that you front-run it you try to get the fact out ahead of whoever [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=173.28s)]
*  Like did all the hard work to report out this anecdote [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=177.6s)]
*  So he films a video of himself telling this anecdote to I presumably the most batshit [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=180.29999999999998s)]
*  Crazy person he could find who was Roseanne Barr and even her face in the reaction shots is like [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=186.1s)]
*  What are you talking about pal? Like you have lost the thread even for me [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=191.42000000000002s)]
*  It's incredible and she just happened to be in his kitchen like that's a weird thing is [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=194.96s)]
*  Roseanne Barr like in the guest house like kid, okay, like what's going on here? I'm reading Jeffrey Tubin's [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=199.46s)]
*  Book about the OJ Simpson trial right now, which is many years old but is incredible and I just I'd forgotten all about kid [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=205.9s)]
*  Okay, what a character. Yeah, one of the better OJ characters [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=211.42000000000002s)]
*  I'm not gonna make it since I'm on a version of zoom. I'm not gonna make a Jeffrey Tubin joke though [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=214.82s)]
*  Oh boy. Yeah, well that the little [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=219.94s)]
*  Say you stay there [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=222.14000000000001s)]
*  Anyway, look glad we got through that cuz I just you know, what a story but back to the show [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=223.74s)]
*  We're gonna talk about a lot of big news [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=229.54s)]
*  So there's this major military operation by the Ukrainian forces into Russia and that still going on right now [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=232.22s)]
*  We've got this ongoing concern that Iran and Hezbollah are preparing to retaliate against [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=237.26s)]
*  Israel and launch some major strike [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=242.94s)]
*  We'll talk about the latest on you know, the ongoing nightmare that is life in Gaza in effort to broker a ceasefire [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=245.1s)]
*  We'll talk about how activists are trying to change course now that Joe Biden is not running for a re-election [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=251.01999999999998s)]
*  It influenced Kamala Harris's policy and you know thing that things people are doing her events [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=256.5s)]
*  To try to put more pressure on the administration to change course on Gaza [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=261.94s)]
*  And then we're also gonna cover the reports that Iran hacked the Trump campaign the latest from Venezuela [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=266.65999999999997s)]
*  a couple weeks after the election an ISIS plot against Taylor Swift and [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=272.26s)]
*  The most offensive thing to happen to Pompeii since that song by Bastille. So we got a big show [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=276.65999999999997s)]
*  Just kidding. I don't dislike Bastille. They're fine. Then then you did the interview today. What do we got? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=283.02s)]
*  Yeah, so this is the third anniversary of the collapse of Kabul [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  And so I think it was important to kind of circle back to that and we had Sahar Halaam Zion [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=290.78s)]
*  Who's been on this podcast before? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=295.84s)]
*  She works for the Malala fund now which is doing a lot of work to support women and girls in Afghanistan [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=297.78s)]
*  So we talked about how life has changed obviously for the worst [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=303.65999999999997s)]
*  Really the horrific conditions kind of hopelessness that women and girls have in Afghanistan [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=307.5s)]
*  But also their incredible bravery and continuing to protest for their rights [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=312.41999999999996s)]
*  Malala has taken the lead in advancing the idea of gender apartheid [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=316.38s)]
*  essentially that the Taliban system of [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=321.94s)]
*  Denying women access to really anything in Afghanistan is a tantamount to [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=324.42s)]
*  Apartheid and trying to get that codified under international law as a crime [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=328.54s)]
*  It is an interesting idea. Yeah, like obviously it's apartheid, right? I mean clearly yeah, there's a common sense to it [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=332.62s)]
*  You know that essentially if you're a woman Afghanistan, it's just like if you were a black person in South Africa [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=338.38s)]
*  It's a totally separate set of laws [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=343.18s)]
*  And so it's an innovative way [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=345.18s)]
*  To try to get new tools to hold the Taliban accountable to ensure that countries including the US [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=347.7s)]
*  Have women included in their engagements with Afghanistan. So it's definitely worth checking out [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=353.38000000000005s)]
*  It's a powerful interview at a you know, a sad anniversary. Yeah, absolutely [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=359.26000000000005s)]
*  And so ours are incredibly compelling, you know person and who's done a lot of great work both in and out of government [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=364.06s)]
*  So worth checking out. Okay, then so let's start with [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=370.1s)]
*  This big development from Ukraine. So you know the top military commander in Ukraine says that his forces now control [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=373.86s)]
*  386 square miles of Russian territory in the Kursk region of Russia for our international listeners [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=381.78s)]
*  That's a thousand square kilometers nice little conversion chart there [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=387.42s)]
*  So this is an area right on the board border between Russia and Ukraine [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=390.7s)]
*  The Russian governor of the Kursk region says that over 120,000 civilians have had to flee and 60,000 more are waiting to get evacuated [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=395.58s)]
*  Russians are also being evacuated from the neighboring Belgarad region. So this was a [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=403.58s)]
*  Surprise operation launched by Ukraine last week [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=409.38s)]
*  According to Bloomberg News [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=412.5s)]
*  It was kept secret from even the rank-and-file soldiers until the day before [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=413.7s)]
*  So these guys were just kind of amassing in the woods not knowing where they're gonna go next [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=417.90000000000003s)]
*  the Ukrainian military clearly found [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=422.22s)]
*  inexploited a [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=425.58s)]
*  Border crossing that was thinly guarded [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=427.22s)]
*  They seem to have surprised the Russians or at least the Russian military was very slow to respond to whatever they saw [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=429.54s)]
*  I would imagine been that Putin is furious about this, you know humiliating operation [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=436.17999999999995s)]
*  But analysts at the Institute of War say the Kremlin seemed to be trying to downplay it to avoid panic or backlash [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=441.09999999999997s)]
*  That said I've seen some reports that Russians in Moscow have rallied to support people who were evacuated from Kursk [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=448.06s)]
*  So, you know, there is a scenario where Putin could use this to his advantage and you know rally more broad support for the war [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=454.82s)]
*  But you know time will tell um [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=461.12s)]
*  In a televised meeting with security officials Putin said quote the West is fighting us with the hands of Ukrainians [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=463.36s)]
*  He also said unironically quote [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=468.8s)]
*  But what negotiations can there be with people who indiscriminately attack civilians and civilian infrastructure or try to threaten nuclear energy facilities? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=471.88s)]
*  The White House National Security spokesman John Kirby was asked about this operation during a press briefing [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=479.72s)]
*  Here's a clip the only people at war in Ukraine are the Russians [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=484.4s)]
*  They're the ones that invaded Ukraine and Ukraine is defending itself against that aggression [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=488.9s)]
*  This is Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine pure and simple always has been since the beginning [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=493.58s)]
*  I'm not going to talk about [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=499.5s)]
*  Ukrainian military operations as I said earlier, I'll let them speak to what they're doing [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=501.61999999999995s)]
*  We're in close touch with them as you might expect we would be and that will continue those conversations [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=506.02s)]
*  But make no mistake about it [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=511.17999999999995s)]
*  This is Putin's war against Russia [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=513.66s)]
*  And if he doesn't like it if it's making him a little uncomfortable [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=516.14s)]
*  Then there's an easy solution. He can just get the hell out of Ukraine and call it a day [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=519.74s)]
*  Leave it a little NSC shade there from Kirby. So [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=523.8199999999999s)]
*  Then like we just everyone should know like we don't have a ton of information about what's happening in Russia right now [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=528.4599999999999s)]
*  The most experienced analysts don't need there like things are moving quickly [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=533.9399999999999s)]
*  No one besides a small circle of Ukrainian officials [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=537.62s)]
*  Probably seem to know what Ukraine is gonna do next if they're gonna try to expand the territory [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=541.0200000000001s)]
*  They've taken if they'll retreat we don't know but I'm 100% confident that [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=545.5s)]
*  What will happen now is this operation will become a key part of the argument? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=550.5s)]
*  You've been hearing from Ukrainian officials for a very long time [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=556.0200000000001s)]
*  Which is that Biden needs to take the shackles off and let Ukraine hit targets in Russia with US weapons [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=558.7s)]
*  Do you think that this operation makes that argument more compelling? Yeah [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=565.46s)]
*  I think there are a few things going on here and it's the Ukrainians trying to kind of create a new normal [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=569.94s)]
*  For their military operations and for the weapons that they're using [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=575.7s)]
*  first of all, we've talked about a lot over the last year that [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=578.7s)]
*  Ukraine is kind of not losing but you know incrementally losing ground on the front line [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=582.1s)]
*  Russia just has more people more artillery more small arms to kind of throw at the front line in eastern Ukraine [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=588.82s)]
*  Russia had actually been making some gains in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine morale was down in Ukraine [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=595.78s)]
*  They're they're stretched thin. And so I think they're doing a few things here. We've talked about how already we'd seen them [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=602.42s)]
*  You know take some shots into Russia take some shots into Crimea take some shots at the Russian fleet in the Black Sea [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=608.9399999999999s)]
*  That's where they can go on offense [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=615.46s)]
*  You know [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=617.12s)]
*  We learned in their counteroffensive last year that they don't really have the sufficient manpower and weaponry [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=617.62s)]
*  To kind of break through the Russian front lines that are kind of fortified and almost like trench warfare style [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=622.74s)]
*  Where they can make some gains is if they do something that's a surprise and that strikes the Russians where they're not expecting it [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=628.26s)]
*  That's the first thing that's happening [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=633.98s)]
*  I think the other thing that's happening is the Ukrainians were getting very frustrated about the fact that [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=635.58s)]
*  Because they couldn't strike into Russia essentially the Russians, you know treated the Ukrainians like sitting ducks [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=640.98s)]
*  They had all this stuff across the border. They're firing at Ukrainians. Well, this is obviously pushing the front line back [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=646.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well in Russia [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=651.06s)]
*  The other thing is I think there's a lot of talk about getting into a negotiation and even the Ukrainians [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=652.7399999999999s)]
*  themselves appear to be more open to negotiating with the Russians [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=659.6199999999999s)]
*  With the kind of understanding that they're probably not going to reclaim all their territory [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=663.78s)]
*  Well, you might want to go into that negotiation with a big chunk of Russian territory as well [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=667.4599999999999s)]
*  That depends on holding it though [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=672.8599999999999s)]
*  And so the capacity the Ukrainians actually hold on to a piece of Russia is something that we just don't know yet [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=674.88s)]
*  I will say that this is not a small deal like Russia has not been invaded since World War two. Okay [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=680.26s)]
*  That's a long time Putin's whole rationale for this war is about making its borders more secure [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=686.74s)]
*  And so this is the Ukrainians sending a message that actually the Russian borders are less secure [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=692.34s)]
*  It's a blow to the prestige of the Russian state that's supposed to be able to protect the Russian people in exchange for all the horrible [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=696.98s)]
*  Autocracy that they have to put up with right? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=704.66s)]
*  So it's a big roll the dice a big gamble [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=706.86s)]
*  We still don't quite know how it's gonna play out. But I mean look Tommy if like Mexico [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=710.0600000000001s)]
*  You know invaded Texas and took a huge, you know [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=714.98s)]
*  several hundred mile piece of territory [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=718.1s)]
*  That would be something if you can just kind of say oh, it's no big deal, you know, yeah [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=721.26s)]
*  That would be a very big deal [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=725.38s)]
*  And yet we to your point about whether Ukraine will hold this territory [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=727.4200000000001s)]
*  I mean the hard part would be resupplying these troops who are miles and miles into Russia now [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=730.3000000000001s)]
*  I mean look, it's a big deal to move tens of miles into Russia. Russia is also 5600 miles wide [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=735.46s)]
*  So, you know, you know a long way to go before before you're really threatening Putin, but you know, it's very impressive [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=740.82s)]
*  Also, this just kind of got me [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=747.22s)]
*  Got me reading then [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=749.14s)]
*  Because I don't know that we've talked sort of big picture about the war in a while or at least sort of this manpower question [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=751.0600000000001s)]
*  Bloomberg News had a great report on [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=756.94s)]
*  Comparing the manpower at this point of both armies [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=759.5s)]
*  So [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=761.78s)]
*  Ukraine is about nine hundred thousand troops while Russia has one point one five million [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=762.78s)]
*  But are trying to ramp up to one point five million [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=766.7s)]
*  But they're Bloomberg reported that their recruitment efforts are really struggling at this point [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=769.78s)]
*  I guess in Moscow you can get financial bonuses [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=775.1s)]
*  If you're a new recruit that basically gets nets out to you making three times the average salary in Moscow last year [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=777.82s)]
*  So they're offering there's like throwing money at people will sign up for this war, but they're still not hitting these quotas [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=785.62s)]
*  So there's a question about whether there might be another draft [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=790.58s)]
*  And you know what the reason that's necessary obviously is this war could go on for the long term [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=794.34s)]
*  But also the Russians have sustained up to five hundred thousand casualties [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=799.22s)]
*  In the last three months have been the worst period of Russian casualties in the entire war [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=804.26s)]
*  I think there's about a thousand a month or I'm sorry, excuse me as high as [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=808.4200000000001s)]
*  1200 per day happening. So it was just sort of an interesting snapshot into [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=812.7s)]
*  the broader state of the war but also [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=817.82s)]
*  Why these surprise operations are so important because you know, if if the Russians decide they really need to repel [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=820.46s)]
*  These Ukrainian forces quickly they're gonna have to pull a bunch of troops off the lines from other parts of the front [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=828.14s)]
*  And that could change the calculus in other areas. So it's just like ongoing chess game that's happening [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=834.14s)]
*  Yeah, you know the whole thing is makes you think about [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=839.22s)]
*  What position is Russia in? You know, it seemed like they had this kind of slight upper hand [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=843.1800000000001s)]
*  But as is often the case with Putin there can be like some premature triumphalism [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=848.46s)]
*  So there's a couple ways of looking at it one that is kind of negative for Russia and one that is more advantageous Russia [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=852.86s)]
*  Like on the negative side [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=858.38s)]
*  Look, we had progozhen like marching on Moscow remember about a year ago [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=860.38s)]
*  This is the second time in the last, you know, three years that like a basically an invading army has moved into Russian territory [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=864.38s)]
*  And taken it that there's just no good way to spin that [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=872.38s)]
*  You combine that with the kind of desperation for manpower [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=876.46s)]
*  It's not as if Putin is kind of growing 10 15 20 feet tall through this war. This war is bad for him [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=878.46s)]
*  It's bad for Russia, right? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=885.4200000000001s)]
*  And and this is clearly not what he wants the the video people should check out of [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=887.4200000000001s)]
*  Putin hosting a National Security Council meeting so good where he's getting briefed on this is so good because he just looks like [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=892.62s)]
*  He's seething sitting there getting these reports and you see the one where the the governor of the the Kursk [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=898.46s)]
*  Region governor is like he's you know, just talking about how much territory has been taken over by these Ukrainian forces and he's like [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=904.38s)]
*  Leave those numbers to the military just shuts this guy down for like, yeah [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=909.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's just like hey, hey local official, you know the fuck up on the other hand, you know [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=913.58s)]
*  Russia's big they do have manpower. They do have weapons [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=920.14s)]
*  invasions of Russia [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=924.46s)]
*  Traditionally have not ended well, you know, you can ask the Germans and the French about that [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=926.14s)]
*  And so, you know, I you can't get triumphalist on the Ukrainian side [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=931.1s)]
*  I think what it what it highlights is that this wars is just bad for everybody and it's obviously Putin's fault [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=934.3s)]
*  He's the guy initiated it [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=940.7s)]
*  But I think the Ukrainians, you know, it just shows that we're entering a phase where between now and wherever negotiation happens [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=943.26s)]
*  And we're gonna have to wait till our election to figure out how that begins because you know [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=948.78s)]
*  Everybody's waiting to see if it's Trump or Harris [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=952.54s)]
*  The Ukrainians, you know, they just also got their first election [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=955.1800000000001s)]
*  The Ukrainians, you know, they just also got their first delivery of f-16s [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=958.2199999999999s)]
*  They've made their first big play into Russia [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=962.6199999999999s)]
*  You could just start to see [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=965.5799999999999s)]
*  To your original question [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=967.66s)]
*  Then pushing the boundaries, you know of this escalation risk and you know, the americans have been concerned the biden administration has been concerned about [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=969.42s)]
*  You know what could tip into an escalation that causes Russia to to lash out or god forbid, you know [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=976.54s)]
*  You know Putin threatens to use nuclear weapons [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=982.4599999999999s)]
*  I just think we're going to be living with a fairly precarious escalation risk. I will say though [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=985.4200000000001s)]
*  you know the Ukrainians invaded Russia and [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=990.3000000000001s)]
*  Putin's not really doing much different in response. I mean they keep kind of proving that they can push a little further [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=992.86s)]
*  Now the question is how far can they push before you know? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=999.58s)]
*  Putin decides to do something that is more catastrophic than what he's already done and we just nobody knows that except Putin [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1002.22s)]
*  Yeah, so far the response seems to be being bombing random villages. So yeah, yeah [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1007.74s)]
*  But um, this is go to his go-to speaking of wars that are bad for everybody, uh, let's turn to israel and iran so [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1013.02s)]
*  Israel and us intelligence agencies are [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1020.54s)]
*  Reportedly convinced that iran is making military preparations for a large-scale attack on israel in retaliation for israel's assassination [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1023.48s)]
*  Of a hamas leader named ismail hania on iranian soil [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1031.34s)]
*  Um ben, I did not get to listen to last week's episode, uh because I spent [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1035.26s)]
*  Every almost literally every waking moment working or parenting on my vacation [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1040.46s)]
*  So that was stupid of me [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1044.54s)]
*  but uh every time I read about one of these like daring masad operations deep into some [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1046.06s)]
*  Enemy territory, I think to myself why don't you guys just do that and systematically take out hamas's leadership? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1053.02s)]
*  That way rather than continue this catastrophic war in gaza. You mean, uh, you don't need to drop five [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1060.14s)]
*  2,000 pound bombs to to kill like a single hamas, uh operative in gaza [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1066.1399999999999s)]
*  Is that what you're suggesting? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1071.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, i'm saying there seems like there seems like the masad can kill anyone anywhere at any time [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1072.06s)]
*  And I just sort of wonder why they don't why they don't do that [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1076.46s)]
*  But you know, that's more of an aside than a question. Yeah. Well, I mean it it does beg the question of why [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1079.26s)]
*  You need to destroy basically all of gaza, you know, um, I mean [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1084.7s)]
*  To to put a fine point on it [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1089.02s)]
*  There was this bombing of a school last week, you know [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1092.46s)]
*  Which was horrific killed a hundred palestinians a lot of women and children and the israeli [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1095.8200000000002s)]
*  Government's defense was well, you know, there was something like I don't know 12 or 15 hamas operatives were at this school [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1100.94s)]
*  Putting aside that that you can't even you know, necessarily verify that and sometimes those claims have not borne out [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1108.3s)]
*  One that's still not legal under international law like you can't just kill [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1115.42s)]
*  You know [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1119.98s)]
*  Dozens of women and children to kill a few operatives and you can say hamas is human shields [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1121.1000000000001s)]
*  That doesn't mean that you can just obliterate [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1126.0600000000002s)]
*  All those innocent civilians as well [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1128.94s)]
*  but it yeah begs your question tommy of like [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1131.8200000000002s)]
*  it seems like there could have been you know a plan to [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1134.94s)]
*  Take out sinwar with the kind of remote detonated device that they seem to have used against ismail hania and [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1138.6200000000001s)]
*  Um iran that's clearly not the path that they've taken. Yeah [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1145.98s)]
*  Anyway, but back to the sort of concerns about this iranian retaliation [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1150.3799999999999s)]
*  so the the the worst case scenario that you know, the u.s [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1153.58s)]
*  And israel seemed to be preparing for would be a multi-part coordinated operation that includes strikes from hesbullah [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1157.4199999999998s)]
*  Maybe the houthis from yemen and then iran directly. Uh, we don't know yet though [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1164.54s)]
*  The washington post reported that israel is considering a preemptive strike against hesbullah [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1169.02s)]
*  But you know again, they've been hitting hesbullah targets for months [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1173.74s)]
*  So I don't really know what that means on the diplomatic front [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1176.54s)]
*  You've got the u.s the uk france in germany and italy putting out statements calling for iran to show restraint [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1179.74s)]
*  The u.s has been just sending tons of military assets to the region [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1186.3s)]
*  Uh, there was a they sent a guided missile submarine [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1191.26s)]
*  Which is also very notable that the pentagon announced that subs deployment that doesn't ever happen [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1193.98s)]
*  Um, the they sent a bunch of navy destroyers [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1199.98s)]
*  An aircraft carrier is going to the gulf of oman. So like very very serious, you know military hardware [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1203.18s)]
*  U.s military hardware is heading to the region just in case [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1209.26s)]
*  Um, the new iranian president masoud pizeshkian has rejected calls to stand down [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1212.54s)]
*  Calling retaliation a way to stop crime [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1217.9s)]
*  In iran's legal right so he's clearly pretty dug in and this would be his first major decision as president [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1221.26s)]
*  So I imagine the politics for him are fraught [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1226.7s)]
*  Ben, you know the last time iran launched a major attack on israel [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1229.66s)]
*  This extraordinary coordinated effort by the u.s the uk a bunch of regional allies basically prevented any real damage from happening [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1234.46s)]
*  Um in israel and biden then was able to tell netanyahu [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1242.14s)]
*  Stand down like take the win do not escalate further [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1246.6200000000001s)]
*  I guess the question now is like what are the odds that the world gets that lucky a second time? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1249.9s)]
*  My guess is pretty low. Yeah, this is not like a game of russian roulette that you want to keep playing [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1254.54s)]
*  um [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1260.38s)]
*  and [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1261.5s)]
*  Look, there's there's multiple dimensions to this. I mean the first thing i'd say is that [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1263.1000000000001s)]
*  Uh, I don't think the iranian president, you know, obviously it won't be the final decision maker. The supreme leader will be [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1267.42s)]
*  But you know the assassination did take place like right after the inauguration of this guy, you know [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1273.42s)]
*  Which is its own [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1278.8600000000001s)]
*  Timing decision, I mean obviously probably the main timing determinant for the israelis was that henea was in iran for this inauguration [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1280.46s)]
*  But this was someone who was elected literally wanting to be more moderate wanting to kind of turn the page to some more engagement with the u.s [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1287.74s)]
*  That's pretty much derailed. Yeah, good way to uh, prevent that from happening, huh? Good way to prevent that from happening [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1295.1000000000001s)]
*  i'm not suggesting that was the only motivation here, but uh, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1300.6200000000001s)]
*  You know, it's definitely like an ancillary benefit for biden if he doesn't want to see the u.s and iran [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1303.66s)]
*  Engage in any kind of dialogue. That's one thing then in terms of what the response could be. I mean [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1309.9s)]
*  honestly, I the iranians I know why they do it but coming out and announcing that you're going to strike is [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1315.1s)]
*  You know [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1320.86s)]
*  Puts you out on a limb where you feel like you have to do something [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1321.82s)]
*  There's a lot of different things they could do they could launch a bunch of things at israel that could be shot down again [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1325.1s)]
*  Like they did last time [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1330.3s)]
*  Um, I think that you know, they'd probably lose face if they did that [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1331.74s)]
*  Um, I I would prefer they did nothing obviously I'd prefer none of this war was going on [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1335.5s)]
*  So let's just say that you're right that like then there's the kind of response where they could be waves of attacks [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1340.1399999999999s)]
*  from iran [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1347.1799999999998s)]
*  Hezbollah in lebanon [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1349.02s)]
*  Uh the houthis in yemen who clearly would want to be part of any action other iranian proxies across the region [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1350.6999999999998s)]
*  I think one of the reasons why there's all that u.s military moving to the region is they could attack our people [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1356.06s)]
*  Um, that's happening again. Yeah, I mean a bunch of u.s troops were hurt in a drone strike [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1362.5400000000002s)]
*  Uh, I think over the weekend. Yeah, so that's that's another thing that could happen now another way that the iranians could do this is they could [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1367.5800000000002s)]
*  Not announce something not launch missiles, but like a terrorist attack inside of israel or something, you know [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1374.6200000000001s)]
*  In the past that's sometimes how they responded to these things is a few weeks go by and then all of a sudden there's an attack [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1380.0600000000002s)]
*  Like an like a more conventional. Well, not that it's conventional but a terrorist attack. Um, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1386.3000000000002s)]
*  We'll see if they take that road [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1392.06s)]
*  But anything they do, you know [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1394.46s)]
*  Continues this cycle of escalation the israelis do something in return the thing about preempting his blow that was worrying is that [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1396.94s)]
*  There are some people in the israeli government including those far-right [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1403.1s)]
*  ministers and some of the security types [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1406.3799999999999s)]
*  That have talked about invading southern lebanon and trying to create a buffer in southern lebanon [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1408.78s)]
*  So that people in israel can move back to northern israel [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1414.3799999999999s)]
*  Now that has some bad echoes of the 80s if people want to look that up israeli invasions of lebanon [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1418.46s)]
*  Are usually not quick or simple easy disastrous, right? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1424.38s)]
*  and would surely prompt [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1428.78s)]
*  Uh has below to respond in kind and you know further escalate the war in in lebanon. So [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1430.54s)]
*  Basically, none of this is good. Um, I will say too tommy that like on both and you could talk about the ceasefire here [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1437.34s)]
*  but like [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1443.9s)]
*  The us wants to ceasefire and they don't want escalation but we continue to give [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1445.02s)]
*  Totally unconditional military assistance israel. I think just authorized another 20 billion dollars in arms sales [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1450.3799999999999s)]
*  waved any concerns about human rights abuses by certain israeli units [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1457.34s)]
*  That would have been consistent with enforcing us law move all this military hardware to the region [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1461.82s)]
*  So if you're bb nanyau, you know, you you may read, you know [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1466.86s)]
*  In axios background quotes that you know, joe biden's really pissed at bb nanyau, but what you see is [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1470.94s)]
*  Completely unfettered military equipment coming your way [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1477.58s)]
*  Giant, you know armada of u.s military [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1481.5s)]
*  vessels coming to the region [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1484.62s)]
*  You know, this this doesn't feel like exerting leverage for de-escalation. It feels like [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1487.26s)]
*  inserting leverage to you know, uh [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1491.6599999999999s)]
*  Well to to give bb a blank check [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1495.26s)]
*  Yeah, I mean if you're uh [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1497.4199999999998s)]
*  If you're at the bar by yourself and and get into an altercation [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1498.3799999999999s)]
*  You're probably a lot less likely to keep fighting than if you have a six eight nfl offensive linemen behind you who keeps handing you guns [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1501.5s)]
*  You know, I mean like that's sort of like what's happening here [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1508.22s)]
*  By the way, uh, three senior iranian officials told reuters that they will only hold off on retaliating against israel [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1510.3s)]
*  If israel and hamas agree to a ceasefire deal, which you know [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1516.22s)]
*  I imagine some people read that and they feel cynical about it. But again like [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1519.58s)]
*  What if we tested the proposition because you've got the iranians the houthis [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1523.02s)]
*  Hezbollah, they all say that they are targeting israel because they want the war in gaza to end now [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1527.88s)]
*  Maybe they're bad people. Maybe they are liars [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1533.74s)]
*  Maybe the houthis have decided wow [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1535.74s)]
*  we have this capability now where we can just like screw with ships in the gulf and [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1537.82s)]
*  Mess up the global economy and and get a bunch of governments to freak out [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1542.54s)]
*  But like I don't know. Why don't we try ending the war and calling their bluff? That that's what i'd love to see [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1545.9s)]
*  Yeah, well it's always been the case that the only true pathway to de-escalation [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1550.14s)]
*  You know, because we keep seeing these warnings and these statements and these calls and that's all good [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1556.0600000000002s)]
*  And and certainly it's good and important that you know [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1560.3000000000002s)]
*  You want to shoot down things that are fired indiscriminate civilians in israel. We should do all that [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1563.3400000000001s)]
*  but [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1567.98s)]
*  If there's not an end to the war in gaza, this is just going to keep happening and to the russian roulette point one of these times [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1569.42s)]
*  Uh, it's not gonna I mean not that it's ended well already. It hasn't it's been catastrophic already [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1576.14s)]
*  but one of these times it's going to get worse and one of these times you could have a full-blown war in lebanon or [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1580.94s)]
*  full-blown war between [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1585.26s)]
*  uh israel and iran and [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1586.7s)]
*  You know nothing that we've seen from netanyahu suggests that he's truly committed to seeing pure well, not [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1588.94s)]
*  Truly committed to seeing true de-escalation which would involve a ceasefire in gaza [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1596.3s)]
*  Yeah, you can imagine a very cynical read on netanyahu where he would love uh, another larger [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1599.9s)]
*  More open-ended war that would ensure he stays in power. Um a few more things from gaza bed [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1604.8600000000001s)]
*  So you mentioned this horrible, uh israeli strike on a school in gaza city this past saturday [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1609.5s)]
*  Um the the white house issued a statement on that attack saying that israel quote must take measures to minimize civilian harm [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1614.7s)]
*  And that quote far too many civilians continue to be killed and wounded [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1621.9s)]
*  Uh vice president kamala harris was out on the campaign trail. She was also asked about the israeli strike [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1625.18s)]
*  Here's what she had to say yet again that far too many civilians who have been killed [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1629.58s)]
*  I mean israel has a right [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1634.54s)]
*  to [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1636.7s)]
*  Go after the terrorists that are hamas [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1637.74s)]
*  but as I have said many many times they also have [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1640.3s)]
*  Um, I believe an important responsibility to avoid civilian casualties [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1644.7s)]
*  So a few more things out of gaza want to get to in a minute [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1649.02s)]
*  but let's just pause to talk about the vice president's comments for a second because [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1650.8600000000001s)]
*  We're we're starting to see uh happen to her what was happening to biden which is events are getting interrupted by gaza protesters [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1654.7s)]
*  More often, uh, there's an open question still I think about what the uncommitted [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1662.38s)]
*  Movement voters will do at the democratic convention [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1666.6200000000001s)]
*  Uh, people suspect that encampments are about to return to college campuses when kids get back in the fall [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1669.98s)]
*  Um, you and I have both talked with people in activist groups who are trying to figure out like, okay [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1676.22s)]
*  We want this war to end. How do we recalibrate our tactics? [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1680.7s)]
*  um now that [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1684.78s)]
*  Kamala harris is the nominee and not joe biden and I figured we could just sort of like talk through our take [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1686.78s)]
*  Um on all of that because we're obviously people that have been very critical of joe biden's policy with respect to gaza [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1691.98s)]
*  Want this war to end? [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1698.78s)]
*  Um, and you know, I think just want to be like constructive here. So I like I can kick us off [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1700.46s)]
*  um, I do think like my operating assumption and i'd love to know if you disagree ben [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1705.82s)]
*  Is that while biden has decided not to run for reelection? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1711.02s)]
*  I don't think he's going to give up any governing responsibilities, especially not foreign policy and especially not this issue [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1714.22s)]
*  Where he's invested a lot of time and attention [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1721.74s)]
*  But also joe biden just genuinely thinks that he is [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1723.9s)]
*  The smartest guy in the room on foreign policy and the smartest guy in the room when it comes to bb net yahoo [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1727.1s)]
*  Full stop so like that's just a way of saying I don't think kamala harris has any space [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1732.14s)]
*  To really change the administration's policy between now and election day [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1737.9s)]
*  Um that said I do think she has a [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1741.66s)]
*  moral [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1744.7s)]
*  humanitarian and political imperative [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1745.8799999999999s)]
*  To signal that she would do things differently and then you know bigger picture just for like activists who are [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1747.98s)]
*  Listening or really care about this issue [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1755.02s)]
*  I just want to repeat that the worst possible thing that could happen for the people in gaza is donald trump getting elected [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1756.7s)]
*  Because he could care less if this war continues or escalates or de-escalates and also [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1762.86s)]
*  Remember that like the platform adapted at the republican national committee says that trump would deport quote-unquote [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1768.78s)]
*  Pro-hamas radicals and make our college campuses safe and patriotic again [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1775.4199999999998s)]
*  So if you're an american protester donald trump wants to deport you not just not listen to you. So long story short like [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1779.58s)]
*  Do I think interrupting kamala harris's events is going to make her policy change or impact what joe biden's are doing? [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1786.62s)]
*  No, I don't at all and you can tell like in how harris is responding tonally [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1793.1s)]
*  Um that that she doesn't either here's one more clip and then i'll throw over to you [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1799.1s)]
*  I'm here because we believe in democracy everyone's [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1803.26s)]
*  Voice matters, but I am speaking now [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1807.5s)]
*  I am speaking now [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1811.02s)]
*  You [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1813.02s)]
*  Know what if you want donald trump to win then say that otherwise i'm speaking [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1821.34s)]
*  So that was kamala harris, um shutting down some gaza protesters at a recent campaign event you can tell she sort of the the message [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1834.22s)]
*  Just shifted from [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1840.14s)]
*  You know, i'm listening. I care about all these voices like i'm [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1841.66s)]
*  What you do matters to kind of shut up and sit down for the moment. Like we gotta win this election [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1845.0200000000002s)]
*  um ben i'm curious what you make of the kind of evolution of [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1849.98s)]
*  Her responses on these set of issues and what you think, you know [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1854.46s)]
*  If you are like advising an activist group, what is the best way? [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1858.7800000000002s)]
*  To advocate to end this war in this new context with harris at the top of the ticket. Yeah, I think it's um, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1862.5400000000002s)]
*  Like i'd frame this as a two-way street. So first of all on the activist side [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1870.14s)]
*  You do have to you know, and look we should just preface it by saying like I understand [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1874.8600000000001s)]
*  And you and I both know a bunch of people in this movement [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1880.14s)]
*  A lot of these are people who've lost like dozens of family members, you know [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1883.5s)]
*  So it's not the same thing as people, you know, a typical interest group, you know, there there are people with understandable passion [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1887.18s)]
*  Um [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1894.7s)]
*  The question is what is the best way to kind of make some headway on the things you care about? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1895.9s)]
*  And and so from the activist perspective [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1901.42s)]
*  You have to recognize that a couple of things have changed [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1904.0600000000002s)]
*  one [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1906.94s)]
*  Joe biden the man who is truly responsible for the policy that you don't like [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1908.38s)]
*  Is is no longer the candidate and and so just kind of trans transitioning and projecting under her [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1913.0200000000002s)]
*  I know she's vice president, but nobody thinks she's been the decision maker on gaza [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1918.8600000000001s)]
*  No, just projecting on her the same kind of anger that you had at joe biden. I don't think makes sense [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1922.3s)]
*  Just tactically just for pure political tactics [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1928.94s)]
*  It's a changed reality, you know [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1932.78s)]
*  And the second piece of that is the kind of broad multiracial coalition [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1935.42s)]
*  Dare I say like the kind of obama coalition, you know younger people people of color [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1939.9s)]
*  They're super excited about kamala harris and they want to be excited about kamala harris and and a lot of those people [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1944.7s)]
*  Are people that might even be your natural allies [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1950.6200000000001s)]
*  But they don't want to see kamala harris at this critical moment with less than 90 days left [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1953.66s)]
*  You know put in difficult circumstances at rallies and things like that [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1958.14s)]
*  And and you just have to kind of contend with that that reality too [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1961.0200000000002s)]
*  And so then the question is like what are you trying to influence here? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1965.1000000000001s)]
*  Because you're right. She's unlikely to be able to kind of go back from a rally [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1968.0600000000002s)]
*  And go into the situation room and change the policy [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1972.14s)]
*  You want her to number one? [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1974.7s)]
*  Sit down with and meet with and listen to [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1977.82s)]
*  People in your movement, which is something that joe biden did not do really [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1980.78s)]
*  I mean they were kind of couple of heavily curated meetings at the white house [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1984.06s)]
*  But I mean sitting down with people in places like michigan places like georgia [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1987.74s)]
*  And truly listening to them and hearing their stories and what happened to those families. You should be pushing for that [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1991.82s)]
*  You should be going in there with a whole range of things that you'd like to see going forward [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=1998.3s)]
*  You know post november, what would you like to see her focus on? [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2003.1s)]
*  Uh, whether it's restrictions of offensive military assistance israel whether it's enforcing [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2006.9399999999998s)]
*  us law [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2012.62s)]
*  And international law related to you know, cutting off assistance certain units that are, you know, proven demonstrated to engaged in [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2014.2199999999998s)]
*  potential war crimes whether it's [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2021.6599999999999s)]
*  What does a massive aid package look like? [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2024.2199999999998s)]
*  Uh for gaza, um, and what is a much more assertive effort look like to get aid into gaza [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2026.54s)]
*  There's a whole personnel like kind of kinds of people you'd like to see [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2032.06s)]
*  Um working on this policy in a harris administration [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2035.66s)]
*  There's a whole agenda of things and I know it's really hard when you're in the moment here and you're like [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2038.3s)]
*  I'm worried about what's happening in gaza today and tomorrow to look even three months ahead [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2043.02s)]
*  But I think that that that there's really an opening for [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2047.66s)]
*  The the movement the uncommitted movement to kind of channel that energy in that kind of direction [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2051.5s)]
*  On the harris campaign side, i'd say the same thing [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2056.62s)]
*  Um, you can't just say well now you got to get with the program at kamala [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2060.22s)]
*  You you she should be sitting down and listening to those people. Um, we played the clip last week tommy of tim waltz [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2064.62s)]
*  Saying that after the uncommitted movement in minnesota that these people's voices should be heard [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2070.7799999999997s)]
*  Waltz should be meeting with them as well show that there's an open door show that you're willing to have hard conversations [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2075.4199999999996s)]
*  Show you where to listen to people [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2080.22s)]
*  it's going to be hard for them to kind of make promises in those meetings because [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2081.8199999999997s)]
*  Let's face it then they get leaked out and then everybody's arguing about it like but just you know present ideas listen [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2085.1s)]
*  And and also have a change of tone and and she's had a change of tone [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2091.02s)]
*  To an extent of saying I won't will not be silent [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2094.7000000000003s)]
*  You hear her frustration sounds a little bit more acute than biden's when she talks about civilian casualties [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2097.42s)]
*  But but taking a different tone [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2101.98s)]
*  You can't take a different policy when you're vice president [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2103.5800000000004s)]
*  But you can set a different tone in how you talk about the issue talk about the values and principles that are going to guide you [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2106.38s)]
*  So I think there's an opportunity here for both sides of this debate in in our big tent coalition to come together [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2112.0600000000004s)]
*  Um, I hope both sides take it because the risk for the activist is [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2119.1s)]
*  That there's this kind of wave of enthusiasm for kamala harris and they start to turn off even some of their allies [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2124.22s)]
*  If they are seen as kind of trying to disrupt that and derail her [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2130.38s)]
*  On the other hand for kamala harris politically, let's just talk for you know, obviously the moral and humanitarian [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2134.62s)]
*  Considerations are paramount paramount but politically the last thing you want when you do have all those good vibes going in the fall [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2139.96s)]
*  Is yes like huge protests on campuses that are now directed at you [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2145.98s)]
*  A sense that you're not listening [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2150.54s)]
*  Uh jill stein and third party candidates like mucking around in your coalition [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2152.2999999999997s)]
*  jill stein the most cynical person in the world saying that she's gonna recruit a palestinian vice presidential nominee and just looked like again just a [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2156.86s)]
*  Clear effort to try to herd the democratic ticket. It's nothing. Yeah [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2165.34s)]
*  So like I hope that we can find a way to kind of we're not gonna bridge this distance [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2170.14s)]
*  Fully, but at least narrow that distance and kind of create some lines of communication. Yeah, I i'm with you [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2175.42s)]
*  I mean i'm not telling anyone not to protest or not to be an activist in the way they see fit [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2180.86s)]
*  I just do think i'm not saying that either. I think we should all be adults here and [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2184.86s)]
*  And try to think through what is effective and what is not and I think [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2188.06s)]
*  Joe biden felt immovable on this issue kamala harris does not at all [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2191.42s)]
*  I think she starts in a better place and uh, we'll get to a better place [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2195.18s)]
*  But I think we have to be honest with ourselves about the amount of power she has in this moment [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2198.78s)]
*  Um, and unfortunately it is limited [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2204.3s)]
*  Um, just a couple more updates on just the situation in gaza [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2206.46s)]
*  But then we'll come back around to the ceasefire thing because I think that's relevant too for this political conversation [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2209.1000000000004s)]
*  we're having so um in gaza again tens of thousands of people were ordered to move from a designated humanitarian zone and [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2213.1000000000004s)]
*  conunis after israel said that hamas had fired rockets from the area [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2219.42s)]
*  But again, these are people that have been moved over and over and over again as gaza has just been unlivable [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2223.26s)]
*  So hell on earth for these people [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2229.98s)]
*  Um, the wall street journal had a long feature about how aid isn't getting into gaza once again [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2232.06s)]
*  Since the idf operation rafa in may aid going to gaza has decreased [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2237.58s)]
*  Subjecting almost everyone in gaza to food insecurity and resulting in dozens of deaths from malnutrition [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2242.2s)]
*  According to the un the number of a trucks has more than halved to less than 80 a day in june and july [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2247.9s)]
*  and then [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2253.9s)]
*  Politically in israel, we're seeing more cracks in netanyahu's government [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2255.1s)]
*  There's this growing rift between bb netanyahu and his defense minister joav galant that continues to grow and become more public [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2258.86s)]
*  This time galant reportedly called bb's aim of total victory [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2266.1400000000003s)]
*  Over hamas quote-unquote nonsense in a closed-door meeting with the kineset foreign affairs and defense committee [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2269.98s)]
*  Um the net yahu's office fired back in the press saying that galant adopts the anti israel narrative [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2276.1400000000003s)]
*  And that he harms the chances of reaching a hostage release deal [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2282.7000000000003s)]
*  So again, these guys are in the same political party, but uh galant has become this sort of voice of moderation [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2285.98s)]
*  In this very extreme government [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2292.22s)]
*  Um, and those voices keep getting drowned out by more extreme factions [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2294.22s)]
*  And then finally, um right before we started recording there was a report in the new york times that said [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2298.38s)]
*  Israel has been repeatedly adding new conditions to ceasefire proposals that they had already put forward including like very sensitive issues [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2304.54s)]
*  like [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2313.74s)]
*  Demanding that israel retain control of of gaza southern border or not allowing displaced palestinians to return to their homes [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2314.7s)]
*  In northern gaza. So again ben this just sort of like gets us back to this activism question where [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2322.62s)]
*  Clearly bb netanyahu does not want to cut this ceasefire deal like he is doing everything he can to throw up roadblocks [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2327.5s)]
*  Uh in front of his own negotiators at times to prevent it from happening. So [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2335.66s)]
*  I do think we should keep the pressure on the administration [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2340.14s)]
*  Um on the biden administration to you know, cut off weapons and stop sending arms and like fueling this war [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2343.02s)]
*  um, but you know, there just feels like there's no light at the end of the tunnel right now because [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2349.34s)]
*  Um, we just have a bad faith actor in bb netanyahu and a terrorist organization in hamas and getting them to a ceasefire is just impossible [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2354.38s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I think what's depressing about this is that [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2361.82s)]
*  The biden administration after that kind of one weapon shipment was paused in the spring [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2365.02s)]
*  And there was a backlash to that. They seem to have no appetite to [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2371.58s)]
*  Entertain that again, which I think is a tragic mistake, you know [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2375.4199999999996s)]
*  And so the play that they ran was remember biden going out and announcing that there was an israeli [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2381.8999999999996s)]
*  Proposal that everybody had agreed to and now is all in hamas [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2386.9199999999996s)]
*  I've no doubt that hamas is, you know, sinwar is the leader of hamas and no doubt. They're a gigantic fucking problem in the negotiations [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2390.8599999999997s)]
*  It's also the case clearly in this report confirms. This is not an israeli proposal [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2399.6s)]
*  I mean, maybe some israeli negotiator agree to it, but if bb netanyahu continually [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2404.4s)]
*  Introduces new conditions and blows things up at the end [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2409.2799999999997s)]
*  How can you say it's an israeli proposal and the israeli prime minister doesn't agree to it? [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2411.8399999999997s)]
*  um and and you know that's been staring us in the face for weeks now that he's just playing for time and playing a blame game [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2415.44s)]
*  Just trying to you know shift the blame on hamas and even better if if it's the americans that are doing that [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2421.8399999999997s)]
*  And to me the reality is look if they can somehow pull rabbi out of a hat and get a negotiated ceasefire [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2427.2s)]
*  That's by far the first best option. It does not look pretty likely right now though. Tommy [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2432.48s)]
*  And the question is if you want a ceasefire because you think it's the best way to de-escalate [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2437.3599999999997s)]
*  Get aid in and frankly continue to negotiate for the hostages [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2442.7999999999997s)]
*  Then the ceasefire itself has to be the objective of us policy [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2446.08s)]
*  And that only involves using some leverage to get the israeli government into a ceasefire [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2449.2799999999997s)]
*  And that involves things like weapons, you know, and and [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2454.64s)]
*  So if we're not willing to entertain using leverage [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2457.68s)]
*  We're going to be kind of stuck in this status quo where you're hoping that the diplomats can somehow overcome [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2460.4799999999996s)]
*  The fact that sinwar and nanyahu are the final decision makers here and that's asking a lot of diplomats. Yeah, it really really is [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2465.6s)]
*  one more sort of piece of interesting news here about how foreign affairs is directly [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2472.72s)]
*  overlapping with our elections [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2478.22s)]
*  Last friday microsoft announced that a high ranking official from a presidential campaign had their email hacked through a phishing scheme [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2480.24s)]
*  That's sort of you know, when you get one of those emails like click this link and you end up, you know [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2487.7599999999998s)]
*  Giving away your password somehow or getting some malware on your computer [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2492.08s)]
*  This hack reportedly came from a unit run by iran's revolutionary guard corps [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2496.3199999999997s)]
*  Since then the trump campaign has confirmed that they were the target of this hack and then the washington post broke the news that [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2500.9599999999996s)]
*  Roger stone was the victim [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2507.2s)]
*  For those who don't know who roger stone is he's like a he calls himself a dirty trickster [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2509.12s)]
*  He's actually way worse than that. He's like a scumbag who worked for richard nixon [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2514.08s)]
*  He was uh, you know reagan guy. He was a quote-unquote rat fucker for ronald reagan [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2519.68s)]
*  He worked for all the kind of worst right-wing racist [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2525.7599999999998s)]
*  Republican operatives over the years and has been a trump buddy for a long time [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2530.56s)]
*  So politico the washington post in the new york times has said they've been getting emails from an anonymous source with internal [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2533.92s)]
*  documents from the trump campaign that included [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2540.0s)]
*  Communications about the vp pic before it was public like apparently like even a preliminary vetting document on jd vance [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2543.5s)]
*  um [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2551.2s)]
*  That said none of these outlets have published any of these hacked documents [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2552.16s)]
*  Um, the harris campaign was also targeted by these phishing attempts and now the the fbi is investigating the whole thing [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2556.0s)]
*  Um, i'm sure our listeners remember [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2562.56s)]
*  The time when the democratic national committee and hillary clinton's aid john podesta were hacked back in 2016 [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2565.6s)]
*  Uh, and there was just a ton of coverage [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2572.08s)]
*  of those materials [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2575.2799999999997s)]
*  Near attended emails reprinted in the new york times. Yeah like months and months worth of coverage [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2577.2s)]
*  Um, also at the time trump was literally begging russia to hack hillary's emails [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2582.24s)]
*  He was also saying things like quote i love wiki leaks and now without irony his spokesman says quote [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2587.04s)]
*  Any media or news outlet reprinting documents or internal communications are doing the bidding of america's enemies in doing exactly what they want [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2592.8799999999997s)]
*  Um ben here's my thought it was a hoax. Yeah, I thought it was a hoax too ben. Here's my question [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2600.3199999999997s)]
*  Um, the irgc is they're bad bad guys, but they're pretty smart [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2604.9599999999996s)]
*  Why are they trying to launder hacked materials through politico? [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2609.9199999999996s)]
*  Like isn't the lesson isn't the election interference playbook that you just buy a url and throw them on there like hand them over to wiki [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2613.44s)]
*  Leaks, whatever. What are we doing here? Yeah. Yeah, the playbook would be to dump them out. I mean the reality is that [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2620.48s)]
*  You know russia china and iran all [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2625.6s)]
*  Are engaged in election interference of one sort or another plenty of reporting on this [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2628.48s)]
*  Uh, they try hacking hacking publish hack and release [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2634.32s)]
*  And obviously a lot of misinformation and disinformation [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2638.88s)]
*  Um in terms of the iranian motivation [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2641.86s)]
*  there's two potential [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2644.58s)]
*  motivations here one is [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2646.74s)]
*  Sometimes it's just showing chaos right and and showing your you know flexing your muscles showing that we can reach into your system [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2648.74s)]
*  And so the reason that if it was iranians, they might go after both campaigns [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2655.46s)]
*  Is that it's not even really about helping one candidate or another. It's just about chaos and and showing, you know, how [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2659.14s)]
*  capable iran is [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2666.2599999999998s)]
*  The other is they do have a their own beef with trump [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2667.94s)]
*  It's the it's the irgc in particular that has never forgiven him and won't for the assassination of costum. Soleimani [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2670.58s)]
*  So they may have a particular motivation to try to embarrass trump himself [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2677.62s)]
*  but you know [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2682.66s)]
*  Some of this is also just like hey [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2683.86s)]
*  Like maybe we all learned after john podesta clicked on a suspicious looking link in 2016 [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2686.02s)]
*  You know roger stone's email hygiene probably not that great [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2691.46s)]
*  Like some of the responsibility has migrated onto the people who have to kind of defend these systems here and [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2695.7000000000003s)]
*  That guy's the kind of guy that like, you know [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2701.62s)]
*  Like probably has like an aol account and and you know, uh is is computer literacy [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2703.94s)]
*  Halted around, you know the the early aughts. I think yeah, I think uh roger stone sort of [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2708.98s)]
*  Famously infamously was uh caught like I think advertising on some swing or swinger websites. I know there was a [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2715.36s)]
*  2000 there was a uh, uh, uh [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2721.6800000000003s)]
*  New Yorker profile of him in like 2008 by jeffrey tubin actually where [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2724.5s)]
*  second appearance by two where roger stone had [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2730.26s)]
*  jeff meet him at the leading swingers club in miami for their conversation about what role that [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2734.5s)]
*  Stone had played in the downfall of elliot spitzer. So I don't know. Everything's just really weird [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2742.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it's not like roger stone's never tried to like steal proprietary information and make use of it. Not saying it's okay [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2746.7400000000002s)]
*  It's not okay a big watergate fan [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2752.42s)]
*  Yeah [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2754.1800000000003s)]
*  people should just be ready for the fact that there's gonna be a bunch of efforts at election interference and [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2754.42s)]
*  One of the things that's happened that's good. I think in our electorate is [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2758.26s)]
*  by the third trump election [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2761.7000000000003s)]
*  like you know, I think not all people but more people are a little bit more mindful to [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2763.7000000000003s)]
*  You know not trust everything they see online and to kind of wonder about the origins of stuff and and if you're working on a campaign [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2769.46s)]
*  Like we got hacked by the chinese in 2008 [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2775.54s)]
*  Some people aren't old enough to know that but like you know, this is not it's even 2016 wasn't the first time a foreign government [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2779.2200000000003s)]
*  hacked a campaign [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2784.82s)]
*  Yeah, I I like I hate the fact that hillary clinton got completely screwed by a hacked material hack and dump released by wikileaks and [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2786.1000000000004s)]
*  And others, uh, and that trump seems to be getting away with it. That said I also kind of think that [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2794.1800000000003s)]
*  Major news outlets showing some restraint around hack materials is maybe a good thing or a good thing rule going forward [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2800.1800000000003s)]
*  Um, I still don't know how you prevent this stuff from happening because again, it's the internet you just dump it online [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2807.46s)]
*  But that's exactly the right point. It's like you're never going to prevent this [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2812.58s)]
*  But what you can do is have better antibodies against it better cyber defenses better public information about you know [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2816.5s)]
*  Information potentially come from state sponsored sources [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2822.96s)]
*  And yeah a media that is more responsible and isn't going to spend weeks publishing [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2826.34s)]
*  You know as much as i'd like to see roger stone's email. I don't need to see this fucking email to know [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2831.38s)]
*  He's an asshole. So like, you know [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2835.14s)]
*  Politico made the right call. Yeah, well said a couple more things before we get to your interview [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2837.46s)]
*  So it's been two weeks since the presidential election to venezuela [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2841.22s)]
*  As we've discussed all available information suggests that despite president maduro's many efforts to rig the election [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2844.98s)]
*  Uh prevent any real opposition from running. He's still lost in a landslide [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2852.74s)]
*  I saw some estimates that he lost by up to 38 points [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2857.54s)]
*  So maduro got smoked in this election [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2860.66s)]
*  But of course instead of giving a power maduro has unleashed a brutal crackdown on opposition leaders and protesters and anybody that opposes him [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2862.74s)]
*  Local NGOs say around 1200 people have been detained some even on terrorism charges [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2871.06s)]
*  And up to 24 have been killed. So it's been very very ugly in venezuela [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2876.8199999999997s)]
*  Now then this is where it gets interesting. Uh, the wall street journal reported that the u.s [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2880.1s)]
*  Is discussed giving maduro and his top lieutenants pardons if they will agree to give up power [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2883.94s)]
*  So like an amnesty deal so maduro has been indicted for drug trafficking and conspiracies and all these all sorts of crimes [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2890.34s)]
*  um, the state department denied this wall street journal report saying [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2897.7000000000003s)]
*  Uh, we have not made any efforts to maduro or others since this election interesting sort of caveat there [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2901.78s)]
*  um, then I just wondered what you made of these reports, I mean [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2907.2200000000003s)]
*  obviously [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2911.2200000000003s)]
*  Giving maduro amnesty in the wake of all that he's done would be very difficult politics [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2912.42s)]
*  Um, I but just stepping back like I personally think getting rid of this guy in exchange for not prosecuting [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2917.38s)]
*  It was a great deal for the people of venezuela [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2924.1s)]
*  That said like I don't know. I can't imagine the u.s offering this to him because there's no way he's gonna take it [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2927.14s)]
*  Unless they've also kind of like figured out some nice villa for him to live in in saudi arabia or something [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2933.62s)]
*  But I don't know. What did you make of this? Yeah. Yeah, so I I think that um, [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2940.42s)]
*  First of all the scale of the defeat kind of matters. He's pretty humiliated and [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2944.98s)]
*  Where it matters is not just internationally, but I think like the venezuelan military which he's relied on [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2950.02s)]
*  You know, they kind of know they're sitting on this powder keg [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2955.46s)]
*  They're they're propping up this guy that can't survive without him who's deeply unpopular [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2957.78s)]
*  And you know the whole thing could blow for them at some point and so I think he's weakened internally [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2963.22s)]
*  And the opposition has proven resilient and pretty fucking brave like they're still going out [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2970.12s)]
*  They're still protesting you also get these reports of mexico brazil and columbia are also getting involved behind the scenes to try to negotiate something [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2974.04s)]
*  Between the opposition and maduro. That's positive too because those are three leftist leaders, right? [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2980.8399999999997s)]
*  Um, all of those are people that in the past, you know, maybe hadn't been pro maduro, but they've certainly [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2987.24s)]
*  You know, they're not in the kind of right wing milieu of latin america [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2993.3999999999996s)]
*  If this guy and his kind of core lieutenants [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=2996.84s)]
*  Can get some beachfront property in brazil and just be done with it like that is far and away best outcome [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3000.52s)]
*  I would much rather see a new government and transitional government in venezuela an end to this nightmare [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3007.2400000000002s)]
*  And you know if the price of that is, you know maduro is not behind bars. He's you know on some compound somewhere [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3013.32s)]
*  Uh in cuba or brazil or wherever [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3019.48s)]
*  Wherever [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3021.88s)]
*  Like that's let's try everything we can do to get that to be the outcome because the goal here is [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3023.08s)]
*  Ultimately making life better for venezuelans and ending this humanitarian and political crisis [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3029.56s)]
*  So I think the administration is right. I think they've handled this well [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3033.96s)]
*  And to be creative and to try to you know, be open to different solutions and and also to kind of let [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3037.32s)]
*  Some of those left-wing latin american governments, um pursue some of these negotiations on their own [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3042.36s)]
*  They don't bring the same baggage that america does either. Yeah, let's take the lead [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3046.84s)]
*  I like the maduro is like trying to get twitter banned for 10 days and then tell venezuelans to uninstall whatsapp as a way of like [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3050.44s)]
*  Stopping the protest. I don't know that that one's going to work buddy. Um, no [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3057.56s)]
*  I'll come more quick thing. So there was some scary news out of austria last week for [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3061.56s)]
*  Taylor swift fans and really anyone who wants to to live in a world where it's safe to be a normal human being and go [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3065.7200000000003s)]
*  To concerts so taylor was supposed to perform three shows in vienna [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3071.6400000000003s)]
*  She had to cancel them all because of a planned terrorist attack that was luckily unraveled [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3075.9599999999996s)]
*  The u.s. Passed along intelligence to austrian officials that led to the arrest of three teenagers [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3080.7599999999998s)]
*  Um when the cops searched the home of the oldest one, they found explosive devices [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3086.04s)]
*  detonators [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3090.8999999999996s)]
*  Uh isis propaganda material nearly 23 000 in counterfeit money machetes knives and anabolic steroids [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3091.7999999999997s)]
*  That last one was a swerve but you know very entertain. Yeah, yeah, yeah entertain exactly [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3099.16s)]
*  But you know, so the authorities thought they were radicalized radicalized online by ices k [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3104.2799999999997s)]
*  But that radicalization turned into a very serious scary plot [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3110.36s)]
*  Um 65 000 people were expected to be in the audience at the concerts each night along with tens of thousands of others [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3114.82s)]
*  So like you know, we don't have to spell out how bad this could have been [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3122.36s)]
*  Um ices has a track record of targeting music venues. There was the botoclon theater attack in paris in 2015 [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3126.04s)]
*  There was a suicide bombing at ariana grande show in england back in 2017 [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3132.6000000000004s)]
*  Um, the swifties who traveled to vienna for the show were understandably scared and heartbroken [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3137.0800000000004s)]
*  But many still gathered in the streets to just sing her songs and be together. Here's a clip [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3143.2400000000002s)]
*  So a couple things ben, uh shout out to the u.s intelligence community for disrupting this one [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3148.38s)]
*  Pretty pretty good work there second very weird and and awful that this was the second taylor swift [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3165.98s)]
*  Connected like violent incident in a couple weeks [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3171.96s)]
*  There was the stabbing at a taylor swift themed children's dance class in the uk that that killed [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3174.3s)]
*  You know small girls and led to these horrible riots. I know you guys talked about last week [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3180.54s)]
*  and then finally it's just worth noting that [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3184.78s)]
*  taylor swift in in 2019 [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3187.5s)]
*  Wrote a piece where she talked about how after the manchester bombing at the ariana grande concert in the las vegas shooting [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3190.1400000000003s)]
*  She was scared to go back out on tour because she felt like I don't know how I can keep my audience safe [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3197.26s)]
*  Given all that is happening around the world and and obviously like she's done all they can they have security sweeps [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3203.1800000000003s)]
*  You know you go through like essentially metal detectors when you go to a lot of concerts these days [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3208.86s)]
*  But the reality is that in a world with isis telling people the target like, you know [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3213.6600000000003s)]
*  Quote-unquote soft targets like concerts or in the u.s where we refuse to do anything about guns being on the streets even bump stocks [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3218.2200000000003s)]
*  Uh, which is the device that was used to make the las vegas shooting so horrific artists just can't [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3226.5400000000004s)]
*  Fully protect their fans and that is that is an awful feeling for someone like taylor swift when you know [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3232.3s)]
*  That you're the reason these people are coming together and you might also be the reason they're at risk [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3236.78s)]
*  Yeah, I mean this was a scary one, you know [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3241.02s)]
*  And and I think one of the questions that you know, the intelligence community is probably trying to answer [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3242.78s)]
*  Is was this kind of isis kind of leadership and strategists? [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3248.14s)]
*  Plotting this in a way that they might try to pursue somewhere else or was this kind of a handful of self-radicalized teenagers? [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3253.6600000000003s)]
*  motivated by isis ideology [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3260.7200000000003s)]
*  um, you know, it matters just because you want to understand whether this was a kind of isolated unique threat or whether [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3263.04s)]
*  Isis has some you know bulls-eye on taylor swift concerts. The problem is once this gets out though in some ways [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3270.64s)]
*  Then you're worried about copycats doing it someplace else. It's scary. It's let's face it. It's scary [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3278.08s)]
*  I mean what you can do is you can have [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3282.88s)]
*  Really really tight security at these concerts [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3285.52s)]
*  I mean, that's really all you can do and and ask fans to put up with a fair amount of inconvenience [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3287.6s)]
*  To try to stop these types of people from getting anywhere near a concert venue, but you cannot totally eliminate risk [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3293.7599999999998s)]
*  I did love the response from those like swifties because [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3300.56s)]
*  like pretty giant fuck you to isis, you know, like the haters gonna hate, you know, like [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3304.72s)]
*  There's a joy to taylor swift that you hate to see being [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3309.7599999999998s)]
*  Corrupted by all these creeps, you know, I mean I that you mentioned that my daughter was in taylor swift camp last week [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3312.9599999999996s)]
*  and so, you know which sounded not that unlike what you know that crime and in the uk was [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3319.2s)]
*  Where it took place, but I mean you can't you can't eliminate risk. I I hope that though that doesn't mean that people [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3326.7999999999997s)]
*  You know, she doesn't keep putting on concerts and that people stop going to concerts. I mean [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3333.52s)]
*  Let's you know, I hate to be that person who uses odds [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3337.84s)]
*  But it is true that if you consider the millions and millions of people who've safely seen taylor swift the last couple years [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3340.96s)]
*  This is by and large a safe thing to do [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3348.88s)]
*  But you know, this is a reminder that [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3352.64s)]
*  You know, there's fucked up people in the world who try to do fucked up things [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3355.12s)]
*  Yeah, there certainly are but also if you lined up, you know [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3357.52s)]
*  All the taylor swift fans on one side of like an old school battlefield. We're thinking, you know, braveheart style [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3360.96s)]
*  Versus all of isis isis is cooked. No, it's cooked. They're gonna smoke their ass [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3366.32s)]
*  I gotta say too good. You know, jake solven was on last week. He said [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3370.6400000000003s)]
*  That uh, the daughter of one of the journalists who was returned in the exchange, uh, missed a taylor swift concert in warsaw [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3374.48s)]
*  And uh and and could anybody help her get tickets? We heard from some worldos really appreciate that [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3381.76s)]
*  a couple plugged in people too, though who pointed out that actually the problem is the vienna one would have been the natural because [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3387.2000000000003s)]
*  That was what's next. So we're still looking for that ticket. But uh, [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3392.7200000000003s)]
*  But what we really care about is people being safe. So at least they caught this one in time [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3396.0s)]
*  Yeah, great work, uh to everyone who was a part of that law enforcement operation. Uh, finally ben [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3400.0s)]
*  Uh, I just want to end with a question which is hasn't pompe been through enough [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3404.48s)]
*  From being buried under layers of volcanic ash to managing hordes of tourists, you know pompe [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3408.48s)]
*  It's gotten a raw deal and the latest indignity is the prospect of madonna renting a pompe amphitheater for her 66th [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3414.08s)]
*  birthday party [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3422.48s)]
*  Uh, this is uh from the always factual never wrong daily mail who reported that the queen of pop planned to invite [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3423.52s)]
*  500 of her closest friends including katie perry to the ruin to celebrate rentals of this particular space the teatro grande [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3430.38s)]
*  Costs just 30 000 euros. I would I expected more that is uh, that could barely get you a decent bat mitzvah space here in los [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3438.32s)]
*  It's like a cheap wedding in la yeah, not that i'm already stressing out about this stuff [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3446.4s)]
*  Uh with a two-year-old not even two-year-old. Um, so not surprisingly though, I guess [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3451.28s)]
*  Some italians were pissed about these reports one official complained about the price tag being too low say it was like giving pompe away [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3456.48s)]
*  Um as of this recording it does seem like madonna has made alternative arrangements for her special day [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3463.2000000000003s)]
*  Uh there she might just be somewhere else with no party. I I guess [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3469.6800000000003s)]
*  I I part of me understands why they were pissed [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3473.76s)]
*  But also I feel like this is now a standard thing like a couple weeks ago [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3476.4s)]
*  We just talked about a wedding at the great pyramid of giza [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3479.84s)]
*  I feel like you can just kind of rent out some some wacky venues these days [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3484.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting like there's probably a hundred of these things that happen and nobody pays any attention to it [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3488.2400000000002s)]
*  And then it's just like what is the one that gets in the daily mail and it gets pissed off exactly [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3492.96s)]
*  Because I I think that's pretty much what's happening here [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3497.44s)]
*  I don't know if there's you know, i'm old enough to remember when madonna had her beefs with the catholic church [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3499.44s)]
*  Uh, so I don't know if that like what was her beef wrong way [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3504.3999999999996s)]
*  The the she didn't have her beef the catholic church had a beef with her. I'm a madonna person like before I was a swifty [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3508.16s)]
*  I was I was in madonna. Oh, yeah, because they're like a prayer video that made sense [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3514.08s)]
*  In my head, I was thinking of chanel o'connor ripping up the photo of the pope and everyone's like how dare she it's like [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3518.7999999999997s)]
*  Hey, you know who was right here chanel o'connor. She had well, I mean her name is madonna. Let's face it [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3523.68s)]
*  Yeah, there is there like a prayer and all that but yeah, I mean, I don't know like uh [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3528.16s)]
*  Maybe yeah, maybe just raise the price tag get something out of it like fix up pompe a little you know [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3533.44s)]
*  Yeah, tax the shit out of them tax the shit out of it. Okay enough about pompe [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3537.68s)]
*  Uh, we're gonna take a quick break [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3540.96s)]
*  But when we come back you'll hear ben's interview with sahar hollam zai [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3542.32s)]
*  About what life is like for women and girls in afghanistan three years after the fall of kabbal [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3546.16s)]
*  So stick around for that this month marks three years [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3550.88s)]
*  Since the calamitous u.s withdrawal from afghanistan and the takeover by the taliban [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3554.72s)]
*  Since then life has changed dramatically in the country, especially for women and girls [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3560.96s)]
*  I'm very pleased to be welcoming back to pod save the world sahar hollam zai [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3566.56s)]
*  Who's the director of the afghanistan initiative at the malala fund? [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3571.2799999999997s)]
*  Sahar so good to see you. Thank you so much for having me back on ben. So, uh, let's just start [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3574.96s)]
*  by giving our listeners a sense of [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3580.8799999999997s)]
*  How things have changed particularly for women and girls in the last three years. What is [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3583.92s)]
*  What is life like, uh for girls under the taliban? [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3588.3199999999997s)]
*  And and how have those uh, how has that changed in the last three years? [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3592.16s)]
*  Thank you so much. I I think every afghan will remember the moment the taliban entered cobalt on august 15 three years ago [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3596.64s)]
*  Um, and since that day they have released a steady stream of decrees that have impacted every aspect of girls and women's rights [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3606.64s)]
*  um [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3616.88s)]
*  specifically [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3618.1600000000003s)]
*  Girls aren't allowed to go to school past grade six women can't take a stroll in the park. They can't go get a haircut [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3619.52s)]
*  They can't access a doctor. They have no freedom of movement [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3627.44s)]
*  It is what many? [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3632.32s)]
*  Scholars legal experts human right activists around the world are calling a system of gender apartheid [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3634.4s)]
*  It's life is unrecognizable for girls and women in afghanistan today and and basically, I mean it's impossible to go to school, right? [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3641.62s)]
*  um, I mean if you are a [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3649.38s)]
*  You know a 12 year old girl in afghanistan [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3651.94s)]
*  What kind of future does the taliban want you to have when it comes to school and work and? [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3654.9s)]
*  And your ability to make your own choices about you know who you marry and how you have kids and how you live [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3659.7s)]
*  The taliban don't want you to have any choice any agency [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3664.42s)]
*  once you age out [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3668.02s)]
*  From grade six, so 12 year old 12 years [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3669.94s)]
*  Onwards you really have very few options other than to [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3673.38s)]
*  remain at home [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3678.1s)]
*  Malala fund has been investing for the last three years in partners inside and outside afghanistan who are providing [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3680.7400000000002s)]
*  Alternative pathways to education and we're doing everything that we can [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3688.56s)]
*  But essentially nothing can make up for what girls are losing out on peer support [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3693.2200000000003s)]
*  Being able to make decisions about what they learn their future. They are [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3700.1s)]
*  fully being erased from [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3705.78s)]
*  Public life and you know, you're in contact with people in afghanistan [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3707.94s)]
*  What is the kind of? [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3713.06s)]
*  mental health picture for for women and girls, I mean to go from [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3714.58s)]
*  You know the relative openness of uh of the last, you know pre-proceeding 20 years to this [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3718.82s)]
*  Uh system of apartheid which we'll talk about in a second [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3724.98s)]
*  What are you hearing from from from women and girls in afghanistan about [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3728.1800000000003s)]
*  Uh what this is doing to their uh, well their mental health. I think there is just deep despair across the country [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3731.86s)]
*  I think for any of us who take so many of our basic freedoms for granted being able to walk to the shop or [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3740.9s)]
*  Go to the park or meet your friends [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3748.5s)]
*  Having that being taken away from you overnight is [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3751.78s)]
*  hugely [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3755.36s)]
*  It's a shock to the system [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3757.06s)]
*  So I think a lot of the people that I talk to every day are still processing the reality that they find themselves in [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3758.58s)]
*  and I think [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3764.82s)]
*  in particular [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3766.34s)]
*  What is [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3767.7s)]
*  What is a huge part of this tragedy for a lot of these girls and women is that none of this was inevitable? [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3768.74s)]
*  You know, it didn't have to happen this way. It was entirely man-made [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3775.2999999999997s)]
*  The us struck a deal with the taliban in 2020 [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3780.82s)]
*  They sidelined the then afghan government they sidelined the afghan people [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3784.7400000000002s)]
*  and ignored [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3790.34s)]
*  Repeated red flags and calls by girls and women and activists and allies that said [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3791.94s)]
*  Taliban 2.0. It's not going to emerge. They are not going to change. They will not be different [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3798.34s)]
*  and here we are today three years later, and it's just [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3804.34s)]
*  a huge huge humanitarian crisis [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3808.1800000000003s)]
*  One of the world's worst mental health crises [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3811.54s)]
*  We're hearing stories of girls who are committing suicide in some of the most horrific ways possible [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3814.34s)]
*  We're hearing about egregious abuses [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3820.5s)]
*  Of girls who are protesting on the streets [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3824.26s)]
*  It is the situation is extreme and dire so you're working with malala [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3828.34s)]
*  On this concept of gender apartheid which you referenced earlier, which is an effort to [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3834.42s)]
*  Essentially work through the un system [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3839.06s)]
*  To kind of codify gender apartheid as a crime against humanity [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3842.02s)]
*  Can you just describe like what that effort is? [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3846.42s)]
*  What what what is the meaning to you of gender apartheid and and how would that enter into? [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3848.98s)]
*  A system of international law. So we've very much taken the lead of afghan women and [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3853.7000000000003s)]
*  The protesters and girls inside the country who are who are who are talking about the system [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3859.2200000000003s)]
*  They're they're being forced to live under and what we mean when we say gender apartheid is this [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3864.34s)]
*  Is this oppression is systemic it's institutionalized and it's a core part of the taliban's governance model [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3871.1400000000003s)]
*  It is their governance model to have men dominate women [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3878.1000000000004s)]
*  That is part of how they rule [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3882.82s)]
*  And there is we believe and we we're working with partners around the world that there is an urgent need to recognize gender [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3885.54s)]
*  apartheid as a crimes against humanity [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3893.2999999999997s)]
*  And we have this incredible opportunity at coming up [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3897.22s)]
*  The sixth committee has been meeting for the last year and a half [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3901.62s)]
*  That's the u.s legal committee and really looking at the draft articles of crimes against humanity treaty [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3905.62s)]
*  And what we're saying is this is an opportunity for us to add gender apartheid as part of that [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3912.34s)]
*  codification [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3919.44s)]
*  In international law we believe that that will close the gap that exists in international law. There is currently [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3921.22s)]
*  Nothing on the books that allows us to really address the systemic [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3928.02s)]
*  Nature of oppression we're seeing in afghanistan today under taliban rule [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3933.46s)]
*  But it also creates rules for states and other agencies and international institutions who are engaging with the taliban [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3937.46s)]
*  It creates a parameter that tells us [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3946.42s)]
*  How we should be engaging with a regime like the taliban and and so let's say [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3949.8599999999997s)]
*  uh [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3955.14s)]
*  This this happened, you know, I know there's a lot more work to be done which we can talk about in a second [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3956.02s)]
*  But what would the consequences be for the taliban or for governments that deal with the taliban if this were codified in the un system? [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3960.9s)]
*  gender apartheid [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3968.02s)]
*  Um as a crime against humanity that the taliban is violating [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3969.2999999999997s)]
*  I think we would look at what the what the accountability mechanisms look like but essentially codifying gender apartheid [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3972.58s)]
*  as part of international [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3978.8199999999997s)]
*  law means that [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3980.74s)]
*  We will prevent complicity of states in such crimes [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3982.74s)]
*  So very much like apartheid south africa and the movement that was built around [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3986.8199999999997s)]
*  dismantling that [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3992.64s)]
*  Oppressive system what we're saying is codifying gender apartheid will [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3994.2599999999998s)]
*  Create rules for how we engage with a regime like the taliban [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=3999.46s)]
*  So if we if our elected representatives choose to sit across the table [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4003.7799999999997s)]
*  from a [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4009.38s)]
*  regime that is [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4010.5s)]
*  Instituting a system of gender apartheid then there are lots of different ways that we can hold them accountable [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4012.1s)]
*  Well, and for instance, I recently right there were some meetings with the taliban in doha [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4017.7799999999997s)]
*  And I noticed that you know, I think secretary general gutierrez might have been involved in other governments and there were no women [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4023.54s)]
*  Um invited to those meetings, um, and that was a bit of a backlash to that. I mean would there [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4031.4599999999996s)]
*  um, would would would one of the consequences be that that kind of thing wouldn't happen that there'd be kind of a [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4038.02s)]
*  higher prioritization on insisting that women's voices are [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4045.22s)]
*  Heard in in other countries engagements with afghanistan. Absolutely. We would it would compel states to [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4048.1s)]
*  Root their approach in principled engagement, which means prioritizing basic human rights [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4055.86s)]
*  So part of the negotiations with the taliban would be there'd be red lines about what those negotiations look like [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4062.1800000000003s)]
*  And there is just this continuation in the way that we have engaged with the taliban since the doha negotiations [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4068.82s)]
*  Four or five years ago where we've conceded to every demand when the taliban have made it and actually this will [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4076.7400000000002s)]
*  Codifying gender apartheid will compel us will compel our elected representatives and other states who are engaging with them [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4083.94s)]
*  With red lines so that we make it really clear that when you're engaging with the taliban it has to be principled [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4091.7000000000003s)]
*  You have to have women [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4097.7s)]
*  Uh at the table and you can't negotiate girls and women's rights away [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4099.54s)]
*  So where does this currently stand? I mean, there's such a common sense of this [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4104.58s)]
*  I mean if apartheid on the basis of race and ethnicity [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4108.34s)]
*  Is codified [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4111.96s)]
*  After the south africa experience it stands to reason that women are similarly [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4113.719999999999s)]
*  A group of people that are facing apartheid like conditions, you know, not just in afghanistan [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4118.599999999999s)]
*  You know, I think iran would be a candidate for [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4123.5599999999995s)]
*  For this as well [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4127.24s)]
*  um, but what what countries have signed on to this and what's your sense of the level of momentum to [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4128.36s)]
*  To continue to push this forward in the un system. I mean the the momentum is really huge two years ago [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4133.879999999999s)]
*  Nobody was talking about it in the terms that we're talking about it today. We have [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4139.72s)]
*  Such an incredible group of member states who are supporting this who have expressed openness to talk about codifying gender apartheid [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4144.68s)]
*  as part of this [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4153.56s)]
*  un process countries like mexico malta the philippines austria [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4155.320000000001s)]
*  We have built a really strong and powerful movement, but we need [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4161.4800000000005s)]
*  Everybody to support this work [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4166.280000000001s)]
*  We need everybody to write to their elected representatives [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4168.44s)]
*  To share these stories of afghan women and girls to share their stories of resistance to talk about [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4172.679999999999s)]
*  The fact that girls aren't allowed to get basic education in afghanistan and we're [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4179.08s)]
*  Continuously engaging with a regime that is enforcing that [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4185.139999999999s)]
*  um [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4189.24s)]
*  So the momentum is really positive [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4190.36s)]
*  Uh, I really think that it's moving in the right direction [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4192.44s)]
*  But we need [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4196.14s)]
*  All the help we can get so you may have noticed we're having an election here in the united states [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4197.74s)]
*  And comel harris has captured a lot of excitement kind of mobilize people that had [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4203.5s)]
*  Kind of gotten pretty turned off u.s politics [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4208.78s)]
*  Kind of rebuilding some of that obama coalition of younger people people of color women are central to her message because [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4212.3s)]
*  Reproductive freedom and abortion have been very mobilizing issues for her here. Um, i'm i'm kind of [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4219.0s)]
*  tossing a softball sahar in the sense of uh, [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4225.26s)]
*  What would you like to see a kamala harris do if she's elected on this issue? [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4228.94s)]
*  And and frankly like what is the u.s as the u.s is kind of beginning to be concerned about isis and you know, [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4233.18s)]
*  it's reconstitution and parts of afghanistan and [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4240.62s)]
*  How would you you know, what is the u.s's responsibility here? What opportunity exists for her? [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4245.1s)]
*  And and what would you say to people who say well we we can't raise issues like this because we have to raise, you know [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4250.62s)]
*  National security issues like isis and in our engagement with the taliban. Well, I mean the first thing that I would say is that [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4256.0599999999995s)]
*  politicians on both sides of the aisle in the u.s, but also around the world [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4262.5199999999995s)]
*  you know [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4268.139999999999s)]
*  Precipitated the situation we're seeing in afghanistan today. So I think [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4269.48s)]
*  everybody has [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4274.299999999999s)]
*  Responsibility when it comes to [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4276.36s)]
*  Actually shining a light and trying to pull back from the situation we're seeing happen in afghanistan [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4279.32s)]
*  But I think beyond that [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4285.88s)]
*  If we allow a system of gender apartheid as we're seeing happen in afghanistan today [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4288.12s)]
*  We're just setting a dangerous precedent when it comes to girls and women's rights everywhere [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4293.799999999999s)]
*  To me, I always say [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4299.799999999999s)]
*  If the person that I voted for is comfortable to sit across a table from a regime [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4302.04s)]
*  that is [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4308.36s)]
*  disappearing women from the streets for protesting for their right to education that is [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4309.88s)]
*  It at war with teenage girls that is stopping women from gaining access to life-saving humanitarian aid [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4316.759999999999s)]
*  What will they do when? [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4324.28s)]
*  When they have to fight for my rights. I think that's the question we should all be asking [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4326.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, no, and it's a good opportunity. I mean the u.s, you know, uh, we'll talk a lot about these issues when we were [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4331.0s)]
*  Kind of trying to build public support and justify our continued intervention afghanistan. Here's an opportunity [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4336.839999999999s)]
*  To to actually you know mean what we say about those issues. I wanted to ask you at the olympics [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4345.16s)]
*  in paris [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4351.88s)]
*  You know, there was one seen in there were several afghan women there [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4353.88s)]
*  One in particular, uh, manisa talash who was on the refugee olympic team [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4358.12s)]
*  But an afghan woman, but she she represented the the refugee olympic team [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4363.0s)]
*  Uh was actually disqualified from the breaker competition for wearing a cape with the words free afghan women [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4367.32s)]
*  Which I thought was a you know, very powerful moment [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4373.96s)]
*  You're a former a former refugee [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4377.88s)]
*  um [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4380.2s)]
*  What what are these what are afghan women trying to tell us? [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4381.32s)]
*  Um, how do those does something like that get attention? [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4385.16s)]
*  Um back in afghanistan or is there kind of information block out that that keeps that out? I mean [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4388.5199999999995s)]
*  um [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4393.32s)]
*  What what does something like that mean to afghan women? [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4394.44s)]
*  The vast majority of the resistance and the protests against the taliban are coming from women and girls inside afghanistan [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4397.639999999999s)]
*  From the day the taliban entered cobble in august 15 three years ago to this week afghan women and girls [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4406.28s)]
*  Are protesting on the streets of afghanistan in the face of huge risk. They're being disappeared [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4413.719999999999s)]
*  They're being tortured in taliban prisons the taliban are co-opting [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4420.36s)]
*  Their male family members and their punitive system [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4425.32s)]
*  So if you've been arrested for protesting [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4428.12s)]
*  They will go to your brother or father or husband and say if they if these women have been caught protesting again [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4430.839999999999s)]
*  That you will be punished [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4437.32s)]
*  So the vast majority of the pushback is coming from women and girls inside afghanistan when it comes to [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4439.16s)]
*  the bravery of someone like manizha talosh to me, I think it's [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4447.5599999999995s)]
*  It exemplifies that that resistance inside the country [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4452.84s)]
*  But I also think it's it's very bittersweet in a way because it's such a deep loss to afghanistan as a country [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4457.96s)]
*  And the world really that a young woman has to make that really [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4464.44s)]
*  What I am sure was a difficult decision to use that moment and to use that platform [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4468.52s)]
*  to make that sacrifice to inform the world about what is happening to [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4473.8s)]
*  Her community to women to women and girls inside afghanistan [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4480.68s)]
*  Women and girls in afghanistan know what is happening to them. They're fighting it. They're resisting it. They're running underground schools [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4485.08s)]
*  They're running safe houses [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4491.08s)]
*  They're protesting on the streets against armed taliban [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4492.76s)]
*  the problem [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4497.72s)]
*  Is that the world isn't paying as much attention as they should be so I think that [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4499.320000000001s)]
*  What manizha did was really to inform us about what's going on? [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4505.320000000001s)]
*  And what would you say? It's a three-year anniversary. I mean in addition to your work with the malal fund. I know [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4510.12s)]
*  like so many people you were involved in helping a lot of people who wanted to [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4516.280000000001s)]
*  To to get out of afghanistan because they feared for themselves [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4520.36s)]
*  Um, I know that that is is an ongoing process for a lot of people. There's still people [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4523.8s)]
*  Um who are stuck in their countries without a permanent home. There are people [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4529.4s)]
*  Obviously in afghanistan who are separated from their families [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4534.44s)]
*  um [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYUYM74qDo&t=4537.4800000000005s)]
