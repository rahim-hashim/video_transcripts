Video Description: Tommy Vietor and Ben Rhodes process Trump’s reelection and the role foreign policy played in the outcome, highlight some awkward reactions from global leaders, and walk through what we know about Trump’s choices for top positions like Secretary of State, National Security Advisor and CIA director. They also dig into what a second Trump term will mean for Russia and Ukraine, Trump’s alleged calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky, Elon Musk’s new role as an American oligarch, and the latest developments out of Israel and Gaza, including the expiration of a 30 day ultimatum the Biden administration gave to Netanyahu’s government about increasing aid access. Then Ben speaks with Senator Chris Murphy about where Democrats went wrong and how they can adjust their foreign policy moving forward.

# What Trump’s New Right-Wing National Security Team Means for the World
**Pod Save the World:** [November 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs)
*  Welcome back to potty of the world. I'm Tommy V tour. I'm Ben Rhodes. So that sucked, huh? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=6.0s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm sorry. I'm not there to mourn with you. I'm here in Washington DC with a lot of sad Democrats, dude [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=7.08s)]
*  I don't know how are like that must be a grim scene right now. It's a grim scene [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=14.4s)]
*  It's 2004 vibes, but worse is how I frame it [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=20.32s)]
*  But yeah, it was rough man. It was a rough election night. I mean, I remember I was at the office with you guys and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=26.18s)]
*  On the drive home [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=32.18s)]
*  By the time I got home the vibes had shifted [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=34.54s)]
*  180 degrees in a bad direction, you know [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=38.42s)]
*  And it was tough watching with my kids, you know [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=41.94s)]
*  Especially two daughters who were all excited about a woman president, you know [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=45.22s)]
*  That was not a pleasant experience to explain to them why this was happening [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=50.34s)]
*  Yeah, I went into the sort of sadness place [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=55.58s)]
*  But I quickly left and have arrived at anger and I'm just kind of hanging out here for a while [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=59.26s)]
*  I'm excited to be angry for a while. I'm picking fights on Twitter [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=64.26s)]
*  Shouting at people telling random, you know assholes to fuck off that I've disliked for a long time. So that part's fun [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=67.62s)]
*  Anger is good. My first cycle was [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=74.82s)]
*  To understand it, you know, I wrote this piece for the New York Times [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=79.42s)]
*  Great, so I kind of channeled my feelings into that for a couple days, but then when that was done I [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=83.26s)]
*  Just felt the anger so so I think I'm where you are now, which is probably a good frame of mind for podcasts [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=90.7s)]
*  I actually think it's a great it's a great friend. Yeah, I guess so [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=95.86s)]
*  We're gonna cover the results the election from a foreign policy perspective both [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=98.7s)]
*  You know how the issues that we cover on this show impacted what happened on Tuesday how the results will impact [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=101.9s)]
*  Trump's policy generally and how they're being received around the world [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=108.94s)]
*  We're also going to cover the latest news about Trump's national security team and who we selected to be as part of the cabinet [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=111.78s)]
*  Including picks to be Secretary of State Homeland Security [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=119.34s)]
*  Ambassador to the UN National Security Advisor and US ambassador to Israel and what those picks say about the broader direction [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=122.7s)]
*  That Trump is going in with this foreign policy. We will also dig a little bit deeper on the impact [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=129.34s)]
*  This will have the selection result will have on Russia and Ukraine and the US-Israel relationship [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=134.7s)]
*  We know we've covered those areas a lot lately. We promise we'll get back to the more like scan the globe [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=140.12s)]
*  Structure of the show soon, but you know, it was just hard to imagine talking about anything but the election and [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  It will obviously have huge implications for both Gaza and Ukraine [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=155.04s)]
*  So it's worth talking about and then Ben you spoke with Senator Chris Murphy earlier today, I believe right? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=158.76s)]
*  Yeah, so I talked to Chris Murphy [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=164.32s)]
*  We kind of covered [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=166.36s)]
*  The what does this mean for the Democrats he's been one of the more thoughtful people and talking about the need to move beyond [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=168.72000000000003s)]
*  Kind of what I wrote about in my New York Times piece moving beyond neoliberalism moving beyond defending establishments that people don't like [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=177.56s)]
*  We talked about what that means for foreign policy. A lot of times people focus on kind of working class economics [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=183.84s)]
*  we focused also on what it means for the world and then we got his first reaction to [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=188.8s)]
*  Trump's national security appointments what it's like to be heading into [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=193.84s)]
*  Opposition to Trump what he thinks about Elon Musk playing this oligarch Secretary of State figure [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=198.56s)]
*  So a lot there people should check it out. That's cool [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=204.20000000000002s)]
*  Um, I sincerely no longer know what neoliberalism means mostly on Twitter just means like people I don't like [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=206.58s)]
*  Depending on who's saying it to you, but I'm here excited to hear Murphy's views also trusting markets trusting establishments [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=212.76000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, broken basically public private partnerships. Also imagine being Chris Murphy. You're sitting there thinking [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=219.24s)]
*  Somewhere deep down inside maybe I could be the next Secretary of State and then you see Marco Rubio [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=225.44s)]
*  Get named like that's gotta suck [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=230.32s)]
*  Yeah, guy who you've been on the farm relations committee with to and seen changes colors [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=232.84s)]
*  I mean Murphy didn't mince words about all these neo cons are trying to read [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=238.18s)]
*  Reestablish themselves as America firsters and Marco Rubio definitely fits that category which we'll talk about [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=243.48s)]
*  So yeah, you could sense his annoyance with that Marco Rubio sold never Trump merch in 2016 [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=248.2s)]
*  But we I digress. All right, Ben, let's do a little just kind of general reaction and analysis to this election [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=254.32s)]
*  So, you know listeners to this show are probably well aware that in Cummins [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=259.8s)]
*  I've been getting crushed in elections all around the world recently because you and I have been covering those elections [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=264.58s)]
*  But for the first time since World War two every governing party up for election in a developed country lost vote share [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=270.08s)]
*  So I do think you need to look at our [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=276.8s)]
*  Election results in that global context and I suspect a lot of what we saw was anger from the pandemic and inflation and then [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=279.6s)]
*  Rage it elites that you know [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=287.38s)]
*  I think as you wrote in your piece really does date back to the financial crisis and the economic inequality that has ballooned since then [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=289.0s)]
*  Lots of criticized about the kind of domestic messaging and the economic message, but you and I are world-o [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=296.8s)]
*  So we're gonna look at it from that perspective a little bit of data for you, Ben [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=302.36s)]
*  According to an analysis by the New York Times Trump's win in Michigan [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=306.82s)]
*  Which is a key swing state was mainly the result of a drop-off in vote in Wayne County Wayne County includes [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=310.56s)]
*  Detroit and then suburbs suburbs like Dearborn and Hamtramck that have large Arab American populations [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=317.94s)]
*  So Kamala Harris got 61,000 fewer votes in Wayne County than Biden did in 2020 [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=323.53999999999996s)]
*  That's a 10% decrease while Trump added 24,000 votes a 9% increase [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=328.6s)]
*  Dearborn is 55% people of Middle Eastern descent Trump won Dearborn with 42% of the vote roughly [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=333.88s)]
*  Harris got about 36% Jill Stein got about 18% [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=340.32s)]
*  But in 2020 Biden got 68% Dearborn while Trump got nearly 30% [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=343.84s)]
*  And there's precincts in Dearborn where Harris lost to Trump and lost to Jill Stein [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=349.12s)]
*  Trump also won in Dearborn Heights. So we should say like Harris's decline in Wayne County is clearly part of this broader trend [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=354.68s)]
*  We saw all across the country in places like New York and New Jersey and swing states everywhere [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=361.02000000000004s)]
*  And there's almost certainly voters in those precincts that voted for Trump because you know, they liked him on the economy [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=365.94s)]
*  They maybe they're more conservative and they didn't like, you know, sort of the liberalism of the Harris-Biden administration [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=371.62s)]
*  Whatever, but Gaza was clearly a huge part of the shift in Michigan [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=377.90000000000003s)]
*  And right now it looks like she lost look right now [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=382.58000000000004s)]
*  It looks like Kamala Harris lost Michigan by about 80,000 votes [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=384.90000000000003s)]
*  So it's just I just want to give you a chance to sound off on this because it's just been so [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=388.28000000000003s)]
*  agonizing to watch this train coming down the tracks [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=394.8s)]
*  At Joe Biden and then Kamala Harris for over a year and then see them just get plowed over by the thing [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=398.96000000000004s)]
*  Electorily as was predicted. Yeah, there are two things about what you said Tommy that are actually connected [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=405.12s)]
*  so the first is the anti-incumbency thing and [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=411.66s)]
*  There it is really important for people to understand one way that it can make sense what's happening in America [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=414.35999999999996s)]
*  Which seems to not make sense probably to most of our listeners is to see it in the global context [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=419.79999999999995s)]
*  Which is this anti-incumbency mood that you've had post financial crisis and post pandemic that has been a negative for any governing party [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=424.67999999999995s)]
*  But that is bigger than that because the flaw of Joe Biden and the entire administration [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=433.0s)]
*  Despite a lot of good things they did is he ran a restoration? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=438.96000000000004s)]
*  So just to take foreign policy his slogan his first year was America's back [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=442.84000000000003s)]
*  And that kind of suggested that what we were doing in the past is what we should be doing in the future [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=447.6s)]
*  Right this American primacy this America running the rules-based order [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=451.76s)]
*  America having all these overseas commitments was a good thing and we're glad that we're back [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=457.36s)]
*  And and so I think they walked into an incumbency trap [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=461.76s)]
*  Obviously with Joe Biden running for reelection and then Kamala Harris having to run as his vice president [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=465.96000000000004s)]
*  But more broadly than that just defending [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=470.6s)]
*  democracy defending [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=474.0s)]
*  institutions defending [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=476.44s)]
*  global alliances [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=478.36s)]
*  Some of that stuff is good. Some of that stuff is problematic [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=480.48s)]
*  But it wasn't even defending a different kind of democracy [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=483.48s)]
*  It was as if democracy is an end in itself and not a means of [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=486.8s)]
*  Dealing with inequality dealing with the stuff that people are pissed about dealing with forever wars [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=490.32s)]
*  and this leads me to Gaza, which is [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=494.44s)]
*  Apart from it being a moral abomination and something that was clearly going to alienate Arab and Muslim voters and some young voters [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=497.84000000000003s)]
*  And that was that writing has been on the wall for a long time and the fact that the campaign [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=504.4s)]
*  You know, even after Kamala Harris took over couldn't even have a Palestinian American speaker [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=508.28000000000003s)]
*  What it spoke to is also just a inherent defensiveness [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=512.32s)]
*  About do these people believe anything different than the other guys? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=516.68s)]
*  Because if I'm looking for the person that's gonna give the biggest blank check to BB Netanyahu, that's Donald Trump [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=520.2s)]
*  So, you know, there's probably some defensiveness that led them to not impose any conditions on BB Netanyahu [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=526.16s)]
*  But it also just kind of made Democrats look like hypocrites [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=533.28s)]
*  You know, we talk about rules based order and all these things and then we don't care if these people break the rules over here [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=536.68s)]
*  It made Democrats look like they didn't care [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=541.68s)]
*  About a brown population Palestinians, which speaks to things that a lot of voters in the United States care about [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=544.52s)]
*  But it also just made us look like we don't really stand for anything [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=551.0400000000001s)]
*  Because you know if you want the people that are gonna support BB Netanyahu full tilt [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=554.6800000000001s)]
*  Why wouldn't you throw in your lot with Trump anyway? So there's a lot of lessons to unpack there [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=560.24s)]
*  Infuriating lessons to pack back there and it made us look pro-war when it allowed pro-for-up [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=565.96s)]
*  Murphy made this point to its Americans have seen forever wars in the Middle East [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=570.12s)]
*  And they're tired of losing them and when they saw the Israeli government ignoring everything that we were telling them and escalating the war [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=573.96s)]
*  It kind of played into that fear that how did Democrats become the forever war party when the Republicans started all these wars? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=581.1600000000001s)]
*  But Trump, you know what he did that was smart is when he humiliated his own [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=587.48s)]
*  Party when he purged people [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=593.24s)]
*  You know, I didn't like how he did it [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=595.96s)]
*  But it it suggested that he was something different and when the Democrats are trotting out dick and Liz Cheney [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=598.24s)]
*  You know, it's not just that you know, we don't like dick Cheney [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=605.48s)]
*  It said that's the establishment that people don't like and we have to get past that [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=609.4s)]
*  There's probably some truth to that [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=613.24s)]
*  I'm struggling to get any data to sort out whether like how much of an impact that might have had I saw some [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=614.28s)]
*  I saw someone report that [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=619.16s)]
*  Counties that were like big college downs [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=622.36s)]
*  Underperformed by about a point which suggests that college kids generally maybe didn't turn out, you know [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=625.44s)]
*  so that could just be like a [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=631.4s)]
*  Gaza fatigue thing manifesting with just sort of like younger progressive college kids, but I do think we should [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=633.44s)]
*  Do more to sort of explore [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=639.44s)]
*  this [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=641.88s)]
*  Whether the appeal to sort of moderates turned off the base. I'm not sure that I buy it yet [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=643.36s)]
*  But I'd like to understand it [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=648.04s)]
*  Yeah, I think the only thing I'd say is that we've talked a long time on foreign policy that despite all the mistakes that have been [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=649.12s)]
*  Made there's a sense that your credentials in some way if like Liz Cheney is endorsing you or if you've got some generals [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=654.5600000000001s)]
*  including generals like John Kelly, right who I don't agree with about a lot of things or the foreign policy establishment the people that that were [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=661.88s)]
*  seen as the [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=668.92s)]
*  The validators are actually part of the establishment that people don't like [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=670.2s)]
*  So, I don't know that Liz Cheney herself made some big electoral difference [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=674.32s)]
*  But I do think what did make an electoral difference is this deference to an establishment that Trump wants to burn down and that? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=677.96s)]
*  We see as a kind of validation of responsible leadership [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=685.16s)]
*  We need to be in a post that era whatever comes next to the Democratic Party [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=689.28s)]
*  Yeah [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=693.72s)]
*  and so to the flip side this is there was some concern going into the election that you know the post October 7th rise in [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=694.24s)]
*  Anti-Semitism or anti-israel protests especially on college campuses might hurt Biden and Harris because Democrats would get blamed for you know [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=700.0s)]
*  Protests seem to be by progressives [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=708.64s)]
*  According to NBC's exit polls Harris won 78% of the Jewish vote [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=711.2s)]
*  Trump got 22% Fox News had a little bit different numbers [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=715.76s)]
*  They found 66% of Jews voted for Harris versus 32% for Trump either is fairly pretty close to past margins [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=719.12s)]
*  In 2020 the AP found that 69% of Jews voted for Biden 30% voted for Trump in 2016 Hillary Clinton won [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=727.12s)]
*  71% of Jewish voters [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=735.0s)]
*  So everyone should take exit poll sub sample data like this with a huge grain of salt because it tends to have a massive [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=736.68s)]
*  Margin of error and always gets revised later when there's better data [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=742.68s)]
*  But there was also some county specific evidence of counties with large Orthodox Jewish [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=745.92s)]
*  Populations shifting to Trump that doesn't really surprise me, but then I would just say that like okay if the policy leads to you losing [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=752.8s)]
*  Massive numbers of Arab American voters and Jewish voters. It seems like that's an even bigger indictment of [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=760.52s)]
*  administration's policy [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=767.12s)]
*  And not really I think proving what some you know might want to argue by looking at the dip in among Jewish voters [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=768.72s)]
*  Yeah [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=775.68s)]
*  I think you and I have been through a lot of presidential cycles and the reality is what is true every time [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=776.1999999999999s)]
*  Is that Democrats get roughly the same share and we'll have to unpack the exit poll data as it gets more [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=781.96s)]
*  You know more specific [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=788.8000000000001s)]
*  but Jews in this country are not single-issue voters that the [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=791.0400000000001s)]
*  we make a huge mistake when we [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=796.24s)]
*  Categorize all American Jews is somehow voting only as it relates to Israel [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=799.24s)]
*  And their voters that are a key part of the Democrat coalition and frankly whatever the number is [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=804.4s)]
*  It's a very high number relative to other demographics [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=808.56s)]
*  one of the problems that Democratic Party has is that the organized American Jewish community a [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=812.0s)]
*  pack a lot of the donor networks tend to be far more right-wing than most voters and [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=817.3599999999999s)]
*  sometimes a mistake is you you listen to those people as [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=824.28s)]
*  the spokespeople for this entire [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=828.0799999999999s)]
*  Category of people that run the gamut, you know from secular to Orthodox from super left to more conservative [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=831.0s)]
*  We just have to you know being in a defensive crouch about your policy on something as fundamental as Gaza [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=837.8000000000001s)]
*  Because of some noise that you're hearing from people in that kind of organized community or the donor networks [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=844.84s)]
*  That was a losing stretch. So Ben last thing on exit polls [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=851.12s)]
*  4% of voters said foreign policy was their top issue in deciding how to vote very humbling for for you and me [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=855.12s)]
*  But it is worth pointing out that Trump won those voters 55% to Harris's 39% [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=862.84s)]
*  We don't know if that's because of Gaza if it's because of Ukraine if it's because of just like a general strong weak thing [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=867.72s)]
*  But I don't know doesn't feel great to lose that that broader metric [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=874.8000000000001s)]
*  No, and it's it's probably all the above and it's a particularly damning indictment for a party that's going out of its way [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=878.52s)]
*  to position itself as the responsible stewards of American leadership and [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=883.96s)]
*  Commerce talking about a lethal military and all these things [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=888.8000000000001s)]
*  whether it was [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=893.76s)]
*  The money to Ukraine whether it was the support to Gaza whether it was strong weak [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=895.2s)]
*  the other thing that's clear is that there's a generalized sense that this America first foreign policy message is of a peace with a [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=900.0s)]
*  America first economic economic message, you know, I'm fighting for you and not these other people and [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=909.96s)]
*  Democrats [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=915.5200000000001s)]
*  Kind of carve out foreign policy is this as this test to pass, you know, this commander-in-chief test [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=917.72s)]
*  So we've got some economic policies over here that will serve up to you in some middle-class [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=923.24s)]
*  Poll-tested language and then we have this whole separate message on foreign policy [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=928.2800000000001s)]
*  It's like a section in a convention speech and it's not one message, you know [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=932.2s)]
*  they tried to make it one message around democracy but that [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=937.0400000000001s)]
*  Ended up being a bit of a trap because people don't think democracy is working particularly well in this country and people consistently don't [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=940.4399999999999s)]
*  Want to be fighting wars on behalf of democracy abroad even you know as I support Ukraine [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=946.9599999999999s)]
*  We have to reckon with that [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=951.8399999999999s)]
*  So I think that's a lesson that we need to have one message from our party [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=953.12s)]
*  That speaks to domestic and foreign policy concerns as a whole [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=958.12s)]
*  And and to not kind of carve out these different lanes, which is how Democrat campaigns are often run [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=962.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and also when a lot of people sort of vote on strong versus weak if you're gonna run, you know [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=968.28s)]
*  Kind of a 82 year old [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=973.6800000000001s)]
*  hobbled looking [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=975.84s)]
*  Candidate versus a guy who's you know, looks like a classic [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=977.12s)]
*  Authoritarian strongman there's gonna be some challenges there. Obviously that dynamic change with Kamala Harris came in [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=981.16s)]
*  But I think a lot of the die was cast [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=986.4s)]
*  So Ben you got leaders around the world [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=988.32s)]
*  I think they're they're not as shocked as they were in 2016. I mean we aren't either right [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=990.92s)]
*  I think a lot of people are preparing for this to some extent, but they're still scrambling to react [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=996.7199999999999s)]
*  I saw that a friend of the pod current Australian ambassador to the US Kevin Rudd [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1000.92s)]
*  Deleted all of his old tweets to criticizing Trump saying it was out of respect for the office of the presidency and made previously in [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1006.04s)]
*  his personal capacity [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1013.1999999999999s)]
*  But you know Kevin Rudd was speaking truth to power back in the day [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1014.7199999999999s)]
*  He said Trump was the most destructive president in history and said quote he drags America in democracy through the mud again [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1017.8s)]
*  Spot-on but now there's calls from conservatives in Australia to withdraw him from the US [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1024.24s)]
*  and so we'll see if the Trump people make a stink out of this and [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1028.52s)]
*  Actually push for that you had a lot of leaders from over Europe who we know hate Trump [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1031.6s)]
*  We're putting out statements congratulating him expressing excitement to work together [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1035.8799999999999s)]
*  And here's friend of the pod in current British Foreign Secretary David Lammy getting pressed on some of his past statements about Trump [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1039.84s)]
*  So April 2019 you said deluded dishonest [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1047.1999999999998s)]
*  Zenophobic narcissistic Donald Trump is no friend of Britain [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1052.44s)]
*  Have you changed your mind or is that still your view here Chris? I'm sitting here as Foreign Secretary [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1057.0s)]
*  I've had a meal with Donald Trump. I've met Donald Trump. Did you talk about this stuff? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1063.76s)]
*  Did you apologize did he bring it up not even vaguely? I've got to say I found him to be a very gracious host [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1068.28s)]
*  Did he offer you a second portion of chicken or something? I hear did offer me a second portion of chicken [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1076.48s)]
*  He was very generous very gracious [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1082.72s)]
*  Very keen to make sure that we felt relaxed and comfortable in his surroundings [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1086.76s)]
*  He was funny. He was warm about the UK [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1092.76s)]
*  Very warm about the royal family. I've got to tell you so, uh, that's not fun for let me [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1097.72s)]
*  I don't know. What do you think you think any of this matters like Trump? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1102.6000000000001s)]
*  We obviously holds grudges, but I can't tell I don't think it matters [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1105.0s)]
*  I think [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1108.44s)]
*  I've had my antenna for things to be angry about Tommy and one of the things I'm angry about is [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1109.64s)]
*  Everything is 2017 all over again. And and so there are these stories these kind of think pieces about [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1115.44s)]
*  What countries are doing to prepare to charm Trump? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1122.3200000000002s)]
*  You know what the Europeans are doing the two things I'd say about this or number one [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1125.48s)]
*  I travel a lot in Europe and some in Asia. They've all thought Trump was gonna win the selection all along [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1129.7s)]
*  So so they are not surprised they got some hope when Kamala Harris came in the polls tightened [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1135.12s)]
*  But I think that they most of them more than us thought that this was gonna happen [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1140.52s)]
*  But the second thing is we went through this the first time the charm offensive doesn't work [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1145.4799999999998s)]
*  Look Trump David Lammy may have tweeted that but Trump thinks that all the Europeans think that about him, you know [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1150.76s)]
*  He's not fooled by the fact that some of them have a you know record of saying it on social media and some don't [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1158.0s)]
*  He assumes that leaders of democracies are not his friends. That was the case the first term [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1164.68s)]
*  We had nothing nice to say about whether you know, McCrone tried charming him ended up in a huge fight with him [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1169.24s)]
*  You know Teresa may tried charming him ended up being pretty much ignored. Angela Merkel stood up to him ended up in fight with him [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1174.8400000000001s)]
*  You know, this is where it ends for these people [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1181.22s)]
*  These are not the people he likes [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1184.64s)]
*  He looks at the world and he has an affinity to the strongmen to Putin to urban to you know, Modi [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1186.3s)]
*  To Netanyahu those are always gonna be his friends [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1193.3000000000002s)]
*  These people can try to be charming for a while [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1196.46s)]
*  But ultimately Trump is transactional and doesn't really care about them and doesn't like them as much as these other people [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1198.9s)]
*  So this is kind of wasted energy going back and looking at who said what and I'm not saying this to defend Lammy [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1204.46s)]
*  It's just it is what it is. I don't think you know, maybe there's some people around Trump that have [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1210.14s)]
*  Vendettas for people who said things but I don't think you know [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1216.42s)]
*  Just cuz Justin Trudeau didn't say that that he likes Justin Trudeau more than those people, you know [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1219.34s)]
*  That's exactly right. And yeah, we know who he likes. We know he doesn't I'm sure it'll all play out as expected [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1223.6599999999999s)]
*  But then you know, the biggest news this week on this stuff is the foreign policy staffing that's starting to happen [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1231.06s)]
*  So as of Tuesday afternoon, here's who has been leaked [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1236.4199999999998s)]
*  As filling out positions in a way that seems, you know all but confirmed in most cases [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1240.82s)]
*  So congresswoman Elise Stefanik will be the US ambassador to the United Nations [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1245.7s)]
*  Florida congressman and former Green Beret Mike Waltz will be national security adviser [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1249.62s)]
*  Florida senator and current Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Marco Rubio will likely be tapped to become Secretary of State [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1253.62s)]
*  That's the one that's the most kind of hedged in the reporting so far and then South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem is going to be [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1260.7s)]
*  Secretary of Homeland Security [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1267.42s)]
*  RIP to any dogs that tried to cross the southern border. We don't know who will be Secretary of Defense [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1269.46s)]
*  We know it will not be Mike Pompeo who got spiked via Trump social media post [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1274.32s)]
*  As did Nikki Haley for any job in the administration period and we know it won't be Senator Tom Cotton [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1280.2s)]
*  Because cotton pulled himself out of the running [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1286.08s)]
*  So let's start with a big picture and then we can go to go through these individuals one by one [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1288.3600000000001s)]
*  I think the key through line here is loyalists and sycophants [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1292.72s)]
*  Rubio is the one pick that surprised me the most he is a neocon. He's a hawk [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1296.64s)]
*  He's exactly the kind of person that the magal world says they hate and then you're seeing some of this play out on social media [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1302.08s)]
*  There's some maga types that are very pissed about the Rubio pick but Rubio also spent the last few years [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1308.56s)]
*  kissing Trump's ass at every occasion [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1314.64s)]
*  Including after he was passed over for the vice presidential nominee, which apparently Trump noticed. So here we are [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1318.0s)]
*  I'm a little bit relieved that some of the worst of the worst haven't been named to jobs yet people like Cash Patel [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1323.24s)]
*  Rick Grinnell Mike Flynn who are like MAGA [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1329.04s)]
*  Crazies for lack of a better word, but I'm sure you know that punch in the face will be coming [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1333.08s)]
*  Waltz is not who I expected to be national security adviser. There seems to be some Florida [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1338.72s)]
*  favoritism happening [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1344.76s)]
*  Maybe maybe that's like the Suzy Wiles impact the new chief of staff [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1345.76s)]
*  But apparently Waltz has been close to Trump for a long time and was considered like a Trump whisperer in the first administration [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1348.8799999999999s)]
*  As a whole though, I mean this group is it tilts a little more hawkish and establishment Republican than I'd expected [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1355.4s)]
*  I would say it's bad news for Ukraine bad news for anyone who wants a humane immigration policy [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1362.6000000000001s)]
*  Bad news for Iran because you have to think that given the assassination plot [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1368.44s)]
*  Reporting and then the arrests that just happened that Trump is going to want to fucking destroy them [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1374.1200000000001s)]
*  and then [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1379.16s)]
*  Rubio and Walter really hawkish on China. Maybe that's good for Taiwan [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1380.6s)]
*  This crew is terrible for the Palestinians. They'll back whatever Israel wants and then it just weirdly [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1385.0s)]
*  I mean you keep seeing these reports that Elon Musk Donald Trump jr [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1391.12s)]
*  Tucker Carlson and Rick Grinnell and kind of like MAGA media types are playing an outsized role in [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1394.6s)]
*  Personnel selections, so I don't know. Maybe that means we'll see some real curveballs [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1401.08s)]
*  But any kind of thematic takeaways from this crew so far for you [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1405.52s)]
*  I think the thematic takeaway the main one is you have to compare these people to who was there in [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1408.86s)]
*  2017 and put aside that like two weeks and Mike Flynn was national security advisor before he got in trouble with the FBI [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1413.34s)]
*  It was HR McMaster's national security advisor [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1419.54s)]
*  Rex Tillerson is Secretary of State and Jim Mattis is Secretary of Defense and Nikki Haley at the UN [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1422.54s)]
*  That was an incredibly conventional collection of traditional neocon like [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1428.1s)]
*  Republicans there were not people that were particularly close to Trump [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1434.54s)]
*  He barely knew some of those people I think didn't know some of those people at all before he pointed them [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1437.78s)]
*  All of these people are Trump loyalists even Rubio [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1442.3s)]
*  And by the way, we should say there's like a non-zero chance that he's gonna humiliate [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1446.62s)]
*  But I think we have to assume it's Rubio [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1452.3799999999999s)]
*  all of these people have repositioned themselves as [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1455.1399999999999s)]
*  First and foremost Trump loyalists. They're gonna do what he says. They know going into the jobs more than was the case in 2017 [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1458.62s)]
*  That's why they're there they know that they'll be fired [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1464.8s)]
*  Within a period of weeks or months if they are crossing Trump on key things that he wants to do [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1468.28s)]
*  So these are all people who sold their souls and that's why they're getting these appointments [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1472.72s)]
*  I had the same takeaways as you and to put it into policy [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1476.44s)]
*  You know annexation of the West Bank very much on the table [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1480.32s)]
*  None of these people have any problem with you know, depopulating Gaza annexing the West Bank [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1483.18s)]
*  Confrontation with Iran could escalate [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1488.12s)]
*  The only questions whether Trump's anti-war instincts [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1490.36s)]
*  Moderate military action against Iran by either the US or Israel [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1494.0s)]
*  then Russia [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1498.56s)]
*  Deep concern. I mean Rubio [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1500.36s)]
*  When I was against the last aid package to the Ukrainians, so he's totally reinvented himself [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1502.52s)]
*  Into someone who is America first or on the Ukraine war. This is all bad news to the Ukrainians [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1508.76s)]
*  This suggests that he's means what he said about cutting them off and getting to a peace deal and we can talk about what that might [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1513.68s)]
*  actually mean [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1519.44s)]
*  The China piece is interesting though because it's the one area where you're still kind of allowed to be a neocon [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1520.44s)]
*  And so waltz and Rubio have these incredibly hawkish views on China. So so so hawkish. I mean, yes [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1527.88s)]
*  Like we'll get into a more but yes [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1535.68s)]
*  Well, yeah [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1537.3200000000002s)]
*  And it suggests that that we you know prepare for a bumpy ride here [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1538.04s)]
*  The tariffs are coming the kind of confrontation with China's coming [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1541.44s)]
*  This is the one place where these guys can be ideological [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1544.28s)]
*  And so that's what I see is ratcheting up of tensions with China [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1547.52s)]
*  Along with all the other you know bad things that we've talked about and yeah, you're right. It could be worse [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1552.16s)]
*  I'm interested you named the big three cash Patel Rick Grinnell Mike Flynn [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1557.16s)]
*  Those are the scary guys CIA still open FBI still open DNI still open [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1561.28s)]
*  so all the intelligence jobs are still open and [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1566.8s)]
*  While I'm glad that cash Patel's not national advisor and Rick Grinnell's not the Secretary of State [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1570.12s)]
*  If those guys are in charge of the intelligence community that that's scary. I think it's scarier [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1575.44s)]
*  I think it's scary in terms of like when it comes to abuse like if you're Secretary of State and you're just a [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1580.3999999999999s)]
*  Prick in an asshole and not qualified for the job. That's not good for US interests abroad [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1586.1599999999999s)]
*  But if you have control over the national security apparatus or intelligence collection or could somehow abuse that through the process [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1590.28s)]
*  that's scary to me for [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1597.72s)]
*  You know like the getting back to some of the old-school abuses of the FBI, you know collecting on Americans, etc [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1599.72s)]
*  They're covert operations too. So the CIA has a huge bandwidth, right? [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1607.0s)]
*  I mean, it's not thing we can talk about but the reality is you know [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1613.0s)]
*  People know the CIA can do things totally out of sight through covert operations. And so imagining somebody like cash Patel [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1616.16s)]
*  Being able to or Rick Grinnell or Mike Flynn or anybody like that [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1624.1200000000001s)]
*  Being able to do things totally in the shadows, which will also be the area that is most attractive to to Elon Musk, you know [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1627.8000000000002s)]
*  That that's deeply worrying. So maybe that you know people like Ruby or the front men for this operation [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1636.88s)]
*  But that a lot of the dirty work could end up running through the intelligence me [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1643.0400000000002s)]
*  That's certainly the pattern in American history. And so watching those appointments is important for sure [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1647.2s)]
*  So let's take through these one by one. We'll go a little faster with some of them [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1652.2s)]
*  So Elise Stefanik just manifestly unqualified for the job, but she's a Trump loyalist [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1655.36s)]
*  She's a congresswoman from New York. She's 40 years old [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1662.12s)]
*  Was a very normie normie moderate Republican until she reinvented herself as a mega fire breather [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1665.04s)]
*  I think the question I mean I [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1670.7199999999998s)]
*  100% sure she'll use this position to grandstand on behalf of Israel like she did at the hearings with the college presidents [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1673.6799999999998s)]
*  The question I have is how aggressive Trump will be about going after various parts of the UN budget the US provides a ton of money to the UN [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1681.0800000000002s)]
*  The UNRWA money for you know, Gaza relief efforts. That's probably gonna be zeroed out right away [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1690.04s)]
*  I wonder what will happen to the World Food Program [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1695.48s)]
*  The World Health Organization, there's a lot of pieces of this and it just depends on how aggressive Trump decides to be yeah [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1699.0s)]
*  You're right there to [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1705.4s)]
*  She's the platform she's gonna use is gonna be about Israel, you know, she made her [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1707.72s)]
*  Name in some circles with these anti-semitism hearings attacking college presidents [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1712.24s)]
*  She'll basically attack the UN the same way she attacked the college presidents, you know [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1717.0400000000002s)]
*  Everybody's anti-semite and but but you're I also worry about getting under the hood and kind of crippling the the US [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1720.72s)]
*  Contributions to the UN system. I think we can expect that but I don't think that this is a person Elise Stefanik [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1729.0s)]
*  Who's gonna be a big player? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1734.72s)]
*  It's frankly interesting to me that Republican UN nominees tend to get more attention, you know, nobody was a tea [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1736.48s)]
*  Tea leaf reading Linda Thomas Greenfield, you know, I and that's not a knock on her [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1743.84s)]
*  It's just this is someone who's kind of at the far end of American foreign policy largely a spokesperson [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1748.92s)]
*  And so, you know [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1755.56s)]
*  She's a Trumpie spokesperson who will call them all anti-semites and probably cut funds to things that are really important to people's lives [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1757.0s)]
*  And that's what we shouldn't lose sight of [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1763.52s)]
*  I mean the question for the UN system is can they make up some of that money in Europe and other places? [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1764.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so Walt's is a 50 year old retired Green Beret [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1769.12s)]
*  It's a combat that turned a Republican rep from Florida as we mentioned. He's a longtime China Hawk [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1773.7199999999998s)]
*  He also had policy jobs at the Department of Defense in the White House. He's got a lot of experience [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1779.8799999999999s)]
*  He was described the politico as a Trump defense policy whisperer [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1785.1599999999999s)]
*  On specific sort of areas he is opposed sending more money to Ukraine [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1789.48s)]
*  He wrote quote the era of Ukraine's blank check from Congress is over [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1793.22s)]
*  He had a tweet about Taiwan where he said we must learn from Ukraine by addressing the threat of the CCP in arming Taiwan [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1797.74s)]
*  Now before it's too late [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1803.94s)]
*  That's why I asked state and DOD officials for a timeline and specifics on how we plan to bolster Taiwan's self-defense capabilities [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1805.02s)]
*  So again, he's very focused on Taiwan and all things China [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1811.4199999999998s)]
*  He one time said that he wants to let Israel finish the job in defeating Hamas [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1815.4199999999998s)]
*  He supports maximum pressure on Iran at one point he suggested that the US military should have a bigger role in battling Mexican cartels [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1820.54s)]
*  Then we were joking around about AUKUS a couple weeks ago, which is that, you know, US-Australia submarine deal in an op-ed [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1828.82s)]
*  He wrote mr. Biden and miss Harris have taken some positive steps on China such as strengthening export controls and establishing AUKUS [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1835.78s)]
*  He's apparently an AUKUS fan [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1842.5s)]
*  Shout out Australia [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1844.98s)]
*  So the last thing on this event on NPR waltz talked about how he thinks Trump could bring Putin to the negotiating table [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1846.86s)]
*  With Ukraine. Here's an excerpt from that. I think it's perfectly reasonable that this is going to come to some type of diplomatic [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1854.46s)]
*  resolution and [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1862.1799999999998s)]
*  First and foremost you would enforce the actual energy sanctions on Russia [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1863.8999999999999s)]
*  Russia is essentially a gas station with nukes Putin is selling more oil and gas now than he did pre-war [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1868.8s)]
*  Through China and Russia and you couple that with unleashing our energy lifting our LNG ban [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1876.22s)]
*  And his economy and his war machine will dry up [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1883.02s)]
*  Very quickly. I just spoke with the speaker of the Parliament of Lithuania [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1887.34s)]
*  She buys 85 percent of their oil and gas from Texas and Louisiana. She said what do you want me to do? [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1891.74s)]
*  Go back to buying from Russia [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1897.04s)]
*  Because we've constrained our energy supplies [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1899.1799999999998s)]
*  So I think that will get put into the table now or the the magical thinking part of the yes [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1901.9s)]
*  Administration where there's just an easy answer sitting there on the table for how to get Putin to the put into the table [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1907.5s)]
*  I know a big picture. What's your what do you think about waltz? And what do you expect from him? You covered it? Well, I think [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1912.0800000000002s)]
*  There's a lot of magical thinking in that [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1918.26s)]
*  Let's just take what he said [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1920.94s)]
*  Israel should finish the job fast. Well [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1923.8200000000002s)]
*  Bebe Netanyahu might not be interested in finishing the job fast and by the way, what does it mean to finish the job? [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1926.22s)]
*  Who's in charge of Gaza? What happens to the people there? What happens in the West Bank? [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1930.5s)]
*  He talks about using energy sanctions to cripple Russia. My god, we've heard this for four years [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1934.3799999999999s)]
*  And the Russians have figured out how to avoid our sanctions [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1940.26s)]
*  There's not some magic wand that the Trump people can wave [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1942.86s)]
*  That's gonna make these sanctions somehow bring the war to the end [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1945.74s)]
*  And I think what they're in for is the reality that Putin and Netanyahu may be more Trump [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1948.1799999999998s)]
*  Friendly and happy that he's in there [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1952.26s)]
*  But why wouldn't they press on why wouldn't Putin try to keep taking more Ukrainian territory? [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1954.02s)]
*  Why would he stop now when he has? [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1958.9s)]
*  the likelihood of the US administration cutting the Ukrainians off and not backing them up and the kind of vibe that [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1961.34s)]
*  He's on offense [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1967.3s)]
*  So I think they're they're talking points about ending all these things quickly are gonna run into a harsh reality [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1968.3s)]
*  That the Middle East and Ukraine are unlikely to end anytime soon [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1974.34s)]
*  And they're likely to get worse for the Ukrainians because that's one thing where waltz is very clear [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1978.26s)]
*  He's kind of JD Vance piled on cutting off assistance there and trying to kind of figure out a tough guy talking point on sanctions [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1982.22s)]
*  That's not gonna work this China pieces is consistently interesting though [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1989.46s)]
*  Because again, it suggests that the US is America first kind of everywhere except in the competition with China [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1993.8600000000001s)]
*  We're super hawkish. And so we're withdrawing from Europe or drawing from European allies. We're drawing from supporting the Ukrainians [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=1999.74s)]
*  We're giving the Middle East over to whatever beaming Natan Yahu wants to do [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2005.7s)]
*  But we do have this kind of very hawkish agenda with China [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2009.04s)]
*  The thing I would watch is is does he mean what he says on arming Taiwan? [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2012.28s)]
*  What's the first arms package that goes to Taiwan and I'm not even suggesting it's the right thing to just start pouring arms in [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2016.68s)]
*  there but Trump I would imagine doesn't want to do that and [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2021.6s)]
*  So the area where Trump may be out of step with his advisors is Trump certainly wants to trade war in the tariffs [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2025.24s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think Trump wants to take it in this direction on Taiwan [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2030.78s)]
*  So I'm quite curious how the Walter Rubio thing might interact with Trump's instincts on China because I don't think they're the same [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2034.06s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with you. I mean China is the biggest question mark. It's also the biggest issue period for the US [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2039.54s)]
*  I mean Trump and Xi Jinping apparently talked on Wednesday. That's no surprise. It's sort of your typical [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2044.34s)]
*  Congratulations call but the question is do we follow through on these proposed tariffs? [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2049.66s)]
*  Apparently Trump has said that you know, if the Chinese invade Taiwan you double the tariffs to 200% [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2054.22s)]
*  I mean imagine what that would do to the global economy and you're right [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2060.12s)]
*  I mean, there's all these China hawks in this cabinet [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2062.98s)]
*  Do they win the day and the arguments over Taiwan or does the America first crowd? [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2065.5s)]
*  I guess we'll we'll find out that brings us to Rubio Ben [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2070.22s)]
*  I mean should be honest like I think Marco Rubio is not a very smart person and a political coward [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2073.28s)]
*  But he does have lots of relevant experience right? He's on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2079.26s)]
*  He chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee. So he's got a lot of background in these issues [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2083.26s)]
*  He did was once a big supporter of Ukraine [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2088.54s)]
*  You know, he was the guy like blame the war on Biden [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2092.2s)]
*  But more recently he is called to end the war because he says the US is funding a stalemate [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2094.32s)]
*  Rubio is also very hardline on China in Iran [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2099.64s)]
*  He will continue some of the hardline and dumb policies in Latin America like brutal sanctions on Cuba Nicaragua and Venezuela [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2102.76s)]
*  Someone I was reading something the other day Ben that reminded me that if the US goes through with nasty [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2112.08s)]
*  Portations at a you know, millions of people scale that will absolutely [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2118.56s)]
*  ravage [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2123.52s)]
*  countries in Latin America like El Salvador Guatemala and Honduras because remittances make up like [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2124.68s)]
*  25% of GDP in a lot of these places and if you're sending back [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2130.9599999999996s)]
*  Thousands of people that overloads their systems and also cuts off a huge source of funds. So something to look forward to there [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2134.12s)]
*  Interestingly, then someone today retweeted a clip of Rubio back in 2017 at the [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2141.4399999999996s)]
*  confirmation hearing for Rex Tillerson [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2148.1s)]
*  Where he was trying to bait him into calling Vladimir Putin a war criminal because of what the Russians had done in Syria [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2149.8199999999997s)]
*  I wonder if he still thinks that or if he'll get that same question that his confirmation hearing but I don't know [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2156.22s)]
*  What are you expecting from the Rubio? How independent do you think he's gonna try to be in this job? [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2161.46s)]
*  I think he'll be incredibly weak Secretary of State which suits his personality and [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2166.62s)]
*  The reality is that Trump wants to control these key relationships [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2171.62s)]
*  So [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2174.8599999999997s)]
*  Policy on Ukraine the relationship with Putin the relationship with Xi Jinping [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2175.9399999999996s)]
*  That's gonna run through the White House and who knows like an Elon Musk is probably can be more influential than Marco Rubio [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2179.9199999999996s)]
*  I I look at Rubio and I think they may allow him some running room on say Latin America [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2185.9799999999996s)]
*  Where he's been the leading hardliner on Cuba and Venezuela? [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2192.02s)]
*  And so maybe you know [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2196.7s)]
*  He'll be ginning up the old talking points and the old policies in terms of trying to strangle Venezuela and Cuba [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2198.46s)]
*  We know how well that's worked out [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2205.7s)]
*  And so that could just be further precipitating, you know a collapse in Cuba humanitarian catastrophe [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2207.9s)]
*  Same thing in Venezuela [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2214.9s)]
*  Where that could spread instability it could obviously create humanitarian catastrophes and it's unlikely to dislodge like a Maduro [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2216.58s)]
*  Who's been able to weather a lot of this stuff and so I just see him breaking more things down there without any plan for how to [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2223.7s)]
*  transition to something different and [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2231.86s)]
*  And then you know, I think even on China like he'll he'll probably posture a lot [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2234.34s)]
*  But I don't think he's calling the shots and I don't think he's gonna have a big say on you know [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2239.42s)]
*  What the tariffs are so I kind of think he's a frontman [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2243.58s)]
*  Maybe that's what Trump thinks so take a center people know him. He knows some people around the world [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2247.22s)]
*  He can fly around he can help us with our you know politics in Florida on the Cubans and Venezuelans [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2251.58s)]
*  But I just don't think he's gonna be an important player [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2257.62s)]
*  Breaking news Ben as we've been recording apparently Trump just named John Ratcliffe to head the CIA [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2260.34s)]
*  Folks might remember Ratcliffe from the first Trump administration. He was briefly [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2267.22s)]
*  I think he was acting and then nominated to be the director of national intelligence [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2271.94s)]
*  But he withdrew after even Republican senators started raising concerns about him [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2276.54s)]
*  Because I think some former Intel officials said he was politicizing intelligence or he had lied about his resume [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2281.36s)]
*  There's a few things in there, but before that he's in Congress for a while [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2287.68s)]
*  He doesn't seem great. You know, it gets not it's not like the three horsemen of the apocalypse that we named earlier, but [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2291.56s)]
*  Maga guy it's super interesting Tommy though. The trend is basically Trump is finding people who are at the edges of the mainstream [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2299.36s)]
*  You know, maybe not mainstream but they're they're kind of established from people, you know, they've been in Congress [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2306.68s)]
*  So that's not all the way to cash Patel and maybe this is a Suzy Wiles thing [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2313.04s)]
*  But these are Trumpers these are people that have totally bought into MAGA whether they believe it or that's how they're gonna get ahead [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2317.3999999999996s)]
*  It's interesting. I got Pompeo is somebody that pretended like he was fully on board MAGA [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2324.56s)]
*  But I think Trump knew Pompeo probably disagrees with him on some of this stuff certainly on Ukraine [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2329.52s)]
*  And he didn't want that around so these aren't [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2334.44s)]
*  Fully mainstream people who might have different views in Trump [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2337.76s)]
*  But they're also not the cash Patels of the world and he seems to be threading that needle so far with his team [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2340.52s)]
*  Defense will be interesting a guy we haven't heard from is Robert O'Brien [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2346.44s)]
*  Who is a national security adviser for Trump who who similarly was a more conventional guy? [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2349.38s)]
*  He's gonna reinvent himself as a Trump America first sir. This is the team. This is basically the new Republican Party [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2354.1600000000003s)]
*  The the people that have totally you know bought into MAGA [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2362.04s)]
*  But are kind of have a resume that suggests that they're not you know cash Patel's resume as he wrote a children's book about like [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2365.72s)]
*  a wizard named Trump [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2372.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, he's so he's not elevating the staffers yet to run the agencies again [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2375.2s)]
*  We'll still see what happens in a couple of these places [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2380.16s)]
*  But so I I wouldn't take too much comfort in these guys because I think they've all sold their souls [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2381.96s)]
*  Yeah, and they'll have staffers who will do the dirty work [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2386.64s)]
*  The next one on this list is Kristi Noem [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2389.2s)]
*  She's the governor of South Dakota [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2392.3599999999997s)]
*  We don't know a lot about what she thinks about foreign policy because you're when your governor of South Dakota [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2394.6s)]
*  You don't have to worry about it too much [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2399.2799999999997s)]
*  Alona reminded me that in her book where the one where she bragged about being a dog murderer [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2400.9199999999996s)]
*  She also made up a claim about meeting with Kim Jong-un that she's never really clarified or walked back or apologized for [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2406.9199999999996s)]
*  She also made up a story about canceling a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2413.6s)]
*  But you know, she's pretty odious maga type. She [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2418.1600000000003s)]
*  Supported the Muslim ban when she was in Congress [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2422.44s)]
*  She personally delivered razor wire to Texas Governor Greg Abbott to use at the border [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2424.44s)]
*  So those looking for a humane immigration policy will not be pleased with this one [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2430.4s)]
*  DHS does a lot of big stuff. They do natural disasters cybersecurity transportation security [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2435.2400000000002s)]
*  Immigration enforcement, so it's a big job. It's a dumb poorly constructed agency, but it's got a lot of component parts [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2440.6800000000003s)]
*  And you know one one kind of open question on the China peace Ben is tick-tock [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2447.36s)]
*  Remember Trump wanted to ban tick-tock then he seems to have gotten bought off by a donor and changed his position [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2452.1200000000003s)]
*  Kristi Noem and all these goobers were anti tick-tock anti CCP [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2458.56s)]
*  South Dakota banned tick-tock on state-owned or devices in 2022 [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2462.84s)]
*  But we'll see, you know, how what if she cares about this at all anymore [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2468.76s)]
*  But again, the kind of immigration team is going to be Kristi Noem [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2472.92s)]
*  Tom Homan the former head of ICE turned borders are who was a big driver of the family separation policy back in the previous [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2477.08s)]
*  Trump administration and then you have Stephen Miller at [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2484.2s)]
*  Deputy chief of staff at the White House. So the immigration picture is is very grim [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2487.48s)]
*  Yeah, the immigration picture is gonna be controlled by the White House [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2492.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean the appointment of Kristi Noem suggests this is not a great intellect [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2496.24s)]
*  This is not someone that they even sees running this policy [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2501.44s)]
*  they're gonna run this policy from their borders are and from Stephen Miller and [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2504.8s)]
*  And again a common thread here is some of these big things Trump said he's gonna do mass deportations [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2508.36s)]
*  tariffs on China all these confirmations [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2514.2400000000002s)]
*  Confirmed that you know, that's the direction that this is going [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2517.6400000000003s)]
*  the other thing is that DHS is a shitty job that usually ends up being a [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2521.2400000000002s)]
*  Cabinet secretary that nobody likes and so it's kind of a poison chalice to give to Kristi Noem [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2525.76s)]
*  Because people get pissed after natural disasters people get pissed about you know [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2530.68s)]
*  All these alphabet soup of agencies that don't work as well as people would like FEMA and others [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2536.4s)]
*  And so I don't know she's she's there to to be somewhere and actually it's not really a reward for her [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2542.0s)]
*  It's probably a sign that they just want someone who's willing to go on [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2547.7599999999998s)]
*  television when Stephen Miller is doing odious things and [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2552.2799999999997s)]
*  Defend it. Jesus Christ, man [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2555.7999999999997s)]
*  The news keeps coming as we're recording apparently Trump named a guy named Steve Whitcoff to be special envoy to the Middle East [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2557.56s)]
*  his qualifications [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2565.04s)]
*  seem to be [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2566.7599999999998s)]
*  Being Trump's golf buddy. So that's cool. He's just a real estate investor [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2568.4s)]
*  All right on top of that Ben Mike Huckabee has been named US ambassador to Israel [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2573.6s)]
*  Here's a clip of Huckabee talking about the West Bank in an interview about seven years ago. I think Israel [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2578.84s)]
*  Has [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2585.2s)]
*  Titled deed to Judea and Samaria [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2587.32s)]
*  There are certain words. I refuse to use [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2590.24s)]
*  There is no such thing as a West Bank. It's Judy and Samaria. There's no such thing as a settlement their communities their neighborhoods their cities [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2592.84s)]
*  There's no such thing as an occupation. So that does not [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2600.08s)]
*  Bode well for anyone in Gaza anyone the West Bank anyone who wants to see a Palestinian state. This is what's coming [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2603.36s)]
*  and he represents this [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2608.84s)]
*  Evangelical Christian embrace of Israel [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2611.96s)]
*  that is [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2615.64s)]
*  Rooted in believing that that the Jews need to be there so that the rapture can come and they can be converted [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2616.96s)]
*  So it's not exactly the best end of the story [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2623.0s)]
*  But but look, I mean this is coming [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2626.7999999999997s)]
*  The annexation the West Bank add that to the list with tariffs and mass deportations [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2629.48s)]
*  Yeah, and that's where Middle East policy is going the thing about the golfing buddy [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2634.2s)]
*  Murphy made this point we shouldn't forget that Trump is [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2638.36s)]
*  Term-limited and there's also going to be a huge element of his foreign policy that is about profit [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2642.8s)]
*  It's just pure corruption and there's a lot of money to be made in Middle East, you know golf countries and and so [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2647.56s)]
*  There's kind of be a couple stories happening. There's gonna be what Trump is doing ideologically to America and to American foreign policy [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2654.1600000000003s)]
*  But then it's also gonna be what are Trump and his buddies and Elon doing to essentially loot the power of the United States for their own [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2660.76s)]
*  Purposes, so I don't know much about this Middle East envoy [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2667.24s)]
*  But it's something to watch because we know Jared Kushner walked away from the first Trump term with a couple billion dollars in the Saudis [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2669.7599999999998s)]
*  you know [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2675.64s)]
*  Wonder what kind of deals we made in next four years. I have a pretty good idea [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2677.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah went out a couple trillion two final pieces of this being for Christopher Ray is the current FBI director [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2680.3199999999997s)]
*  He's supposed to be in place until 2027 lots of reports that he thinks he might get fired [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2686.16s)]
*  And that Trump might force him out cash Patel has been floated as a replacement [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2690.8399999999997s)]
*  Sucks then the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump is thinking of establishing a board of retired military personnel who will be given the power to [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2694.64s)]
*  Review review and then remove three and four star flag officers. So generals admirals, etc [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2702.44s)]
*  This seems to be the follow-through is being an executive order that would follow through on the plan [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2709.96s)]
*  The pledge to fire woke generals or you know what that translates to is anyone who disagrees with me? [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2714.4s)]
*  But you know as president Trump has the right to [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2720.64s)]
*  Fire any military officer that he wants but setting up this board in this process [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2723.6s)]
*  Suggests that there could be a loyalty purge of sorts, which should surprise no one [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2729.28s)]
*  That was what project 2025 was about but this is the implementation in the US military [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2734.28s)]
*  Yes, this is the full project 2025 piece of this which is that in addition to these cabinet appointments and political appointments [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2739.28s)]
*  We're gonna reach down start to transform the leadership of the US military [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2745.8s)]
*  Intelligence community. I'm sure this is coming for the State Department and and look people should understand that this is absolutely not how this happens [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2750.12s)]
*  You usually the US military pretty much handles promotions, right who becomes three-star general four-star general [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2756.36s)]
*  I remember in the Obama years the only military appointments that Obama himself would get involved in [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2763.36s)]
*  Were essentially the chairman and vice chairman the Joint Chiefs of Staff the combatant commanders, right? [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2768.84s)]
*  So the people who run like Central Command that's the Middle East or Southern Command. That's the hemisphere Western Hemisphere [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2773.9s)]
*  But even that there would basically be military recommendations [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2779.16s)]
*  you know that came from the chairman the Joint Chiefs of Staff or something and then Obama kind of [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2783.56s)]
*  interview those people and I I don't remember a time when he kind of overruled them and so if Trump starts social engineering the [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2786.8s)]
*  military to have a bunch of MAGA three and four-star generals [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2793.84s)]
*  That is a huge cultural shift and I think what you're gonna see them try to do is kind of magify the US military [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2797.36s)]
*  you know, and that's [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2803.8s)]
*  That's kind of frightening and we should just name that this is project 24 [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2805.96s)]
*  They said they were gonna do this. Yeah, and they're they're doing it. Yeah, not great [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2809.6600000000003s)]
*  finally Ben [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2814.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, there was this article in Politico about people in the Biden world talking about quote-unquote Trump proofing foreign policy [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2814.7200000000003s)]
*  and I'll be honest like I skipped past it five times because I just I [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2821.7000000000003s)]
*  You can't do that. Like the only way to Trump proof your policy is to win to win [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2825.76s)]
*  Yeah, maybe Biden should have thought about that after the midterms and not run [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2829.48s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I guess you could try to appropriate money as fast as possible [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2833.74s)]
*  But you know, that's not really feasible like the IRA all the climate funding Trump could peel back [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2836.5s)]
*  I think a majority of that you can try to you know [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2842.7599999999998s)]
*  Race money and stuff to Ukraine but those weapons systems take a long time [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2846.4599999999996s)]
*  To ship and Trump could cancel them when he takes office if you want [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2850.5s)]
*  So I like I know I appreciate the sentiment and that people are trying but um, there's no fix here. It's over [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2853.9799999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I think they'll you know [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2861.7s)]
*  They can try to shove as much out the door to the Ukrainians and that's worth doing but it's not gonna make up for the fact [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2863.62s)]
*  You know that if Trump comes in and there's a sense that's being cut off. It's not just what's flowing to the Ukrainians [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2869.38s)]
*  It's the expectation about what what might come is the US can be there in one year or two years [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2874.2200000000003s)]
*  These questions member about whether the Ukrainians can use [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2880.26s)]
*  American weapons deep into Russia [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2884.58s)]
*  That's off the table the Russians are preparing for an offensive with the North Koreans in the crisp region of Russia [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2886.74s)]
*  The US is not we'll get that, you know, so so I just think [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2892.02s)]
*  The only way to Trump I've lived through this only way to Trump prove it is to win [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2896.7s)]
*  I hope you know one thing we haven't talked much about it is just the Paris agreement for instance [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2900.18s)]
*  Like but he can withdraw from that. There's nothing we can do to make Donald Trump stay in the Paris agreement [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2905.58s)]
*  Yeah, and the cops happening right now and boy that's got to be depressing [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2909.7799999999997s)]
*  All right with a couple more things. We'll try to get these a little quicker [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2913.38s)]
*  So first on Russia [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2916.5s)]
*  I mean [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2917.86s)]
*  I don't want to go all Mueller time on you but things are already a little weird between Trump and Putin because the Washington Post [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2918.18s)]
*  Reported that Trump and Putin spoke on the phone [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2923.98s)]
*  Trump told Putin not to escalate the war in Ukraine that was according to sources in the Trump world [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2926.58s)]
*  But Putin's people denied it calling the report pure fiction while the Trump folks are declining to comment on the record [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2931.54s)]
*  Trump also called Volodymyr Zelensky president Ukraine for some reason Elon Musk hopped on that call [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2938.46s)]
*  Again, there's lots of reports that Elon is just like won't leave Mar-a-Lago and his wing and all kinds of staffing things [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2945.66s)]
*  Axios said that Zelensky was quote somewhat reassured by what he heard from Trump [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2951.02s)]
*  I find that a little hard to believe but okay [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2956.9799999999996s)]
*  I guess Elon said he would continue to give them access to Starlink satellites, which are a huge communications tool for the Ukrainian military [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2959.4599999999996s)]
*  Meanwhile, as you just mentioned, I mean the Russian military has reportedly assembled 50,000 troops [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2967.2999999999997s)]
*  Including the North Korean soldiers that we've talked about a few times on the previous episodes [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2973.42s)]
*  To prepare for an assault on the Kursk region and take back that territory that the Ukrainian military took from them a few months back [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2977.18s)]
*  Over the weekend Ukraine launched its biggest-ever drone attack on Moscow injuring several people and shutting down airports for a while [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2984.54s)]
*  The head of the UK's Armed Forces said October was Russia's worst ever month when it comes to casualties [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2991.3s)]
*  They suffered an average of 1500 dead and injured every single day in October [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=2997.46s)]
*  So it's just getting a reminder of the scale of this conflict that brings their casualty count the Russian side to 700,000 [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3002.76s)]
*  so Ben [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3009.6400000000003s)]
*  As you mentioned, I mean this is about Ukraine, but it's also about what Putin might do next [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3011.0s)]
*  Whether he might go further into Georgia or Moldova or a NATO country like Estonia and it's not just [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3017.4s)]
*  US politics that are swinging away from support for Ukraine [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3024.28s)]
*  You're seeing this kind of anti-ukraine sentiment increasing all over Europe in places like, you know [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3028.8399999999997s)]
*  France and Germany and you know other countries that are critical parts of NATO [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3033.96s)]
*  That said you like there's a part of this where you know, I hear someone like Rubio say [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3039.3199999999997s)]
*  The current policy is funding a stalemate [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3044.16s)]
*  And a stalemate for Ukraine against a much bigger and better resource partner. There is some truth to that [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3047.96s)]
*  So like I'm torn right like [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3055.08s)]
*  Trump's bigger goal of ending the bloodshed ending the war. It's not bad in and of itself [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3058.7999999999997s)]
*  but I think there's sort of like implications and ramifications of [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3064.3999999999996s)]
*  Unilaterally cutting off the Ukrainians is is the big question and then what Putin does next? [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3067.9199999999996s)]
*  I mean, I guess the question I had for you is what do you think the odds are that? [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3073.3599999999997s)]
*  Putin will actually work with Trump versus just kind of being his usual trolly self to demonstrate that he's not [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3078.28s)]
*  Controlled by the West or you know anybody else? [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3084.84s)]
*  I think he'll try to thread the needle like he has already where he praised Trump a bit [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3087.12s)]
*  But then you know, he's playing hard to get in the sense that [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3091.2599999999998s)]
*  he's gonna want to press as hard as he can as fast as he can to [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3095.04s)]
*  Take as much territory as he can and to kind of put Russia in the best position [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3099.52s)]
*  While saying to Trump my goal is to end this war and I want a negotiation and he's just gonna be trying to change [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3103.84s)]
*  The facts on the ground because ultimately the negotiation that Trump wants have is not a negotiation [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3109.16s)]
*  It's that the war kind of stops where it is and the Ukrainians have to accept that and they're not gonna be in NATO [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3113.52s)]
*  And they're you know, not gonna have US support for things like getting into the EU [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3118.68s)]
*  And so all of a sudden, you know, Putin's in a much stronger position there [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3122.36s)]
*  And and he can you know this body count stuff? [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3127.2000000000003s)]
*  It's like Vietnam like that the number of people that died in Russia is not the you don't win based on who killed more people [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3129.84s)]
*  Now that's gonna cause some serious problems for Russia in the medium and long term [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3136.96s)]
*  But this is the dynamic I think and as someone who would like to see the war end [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3140.2400000000002s)]
*  The sense that the US is withdrawing assistance is the worst possible way to make that [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3145.08s)]
*  Negotiation work out in a way that protects Ukrainian interests at all [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3150.1200000000003s)]
*  I mean if you wanted to have a negotiation with the US saying we're gonna continue to support these people full tilt [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3154.26s)]
*  Unless you know, there's this concession by Russia in addition to this by Ukraine. That's a different matter [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3159.5600000000004s)]
*  But that's not what this is the other thing to Georgia. We just talked about that [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3164.28s)]
*  There's a ruling party that's really pushing a pro-russian agenda. Can you imagine how emboldened they are today? [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3168.0800000000004s)]
*  They're not gonna listen to protesters in Tbilisi, you know [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3173.36s)]
*  They're gonna feel like they have the wind of geopolitics at their back the pro-russian factions in Moldova as well [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3176.32s)]
*  So if you look at a Georgia of Moldova or place like, you know, Serbia where there's a kind of pro-russian [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3182.1600000000003s)]
*  Nationalist there all those leaders are gonna be bold and what's that gonna look like and how does your [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3186.84s)]
*  Fracture and deal with that when there are people like or bond and other leaders [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3191.52s)]
*  What does it look like in 2027 if Marine Le Pen runs in France and is finally successful? [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3194.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, or the AFD is making advances in Germany [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3198.7200000000003s)]
*  and that I just want to say one thing but the Elon Musk thing is so interesting Tommy because [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3200.98s)]
*  We've never had an oligarch like this in the US [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3204.7000000000003s)]
*  You know, this is actually very familiar in the history of places like Russia and Ukraine [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3207.06s)]
*  You know to have someone who's like the richest man and controls vast resources [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3211.0s)]
*  Who's also involved in foreign policy kind of minister without portfolio personnel [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3215.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah him getting on the phone him being involved in personnel while he has these vast business interests including in China, right? [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3219.76s)]
*  So Elon Musk actually doesn't want to see like a complete collapse in US-Chinese relations [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3225.78s)]
*  It'll be interesting to see if Elon can stay on side with Trump or whether he's like the pro-prudence oligarchs [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3230.48s)]
*  You end up getting thrown overboard at some point. Yeah, give me half Elon [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3235.2000000000003s)]
*  Just to turn these real quick [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3239.5200000000004s)]
*  I mean, it sounds like Netanyahu and Trump have talked three times in recent days [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3240.8s)]
*  We don't know exactly when those calls happen, but they've talked a lot [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3244.6600000000003s)]
*  They're not I think all these calls are going directly or ad hoc [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3248.36s)]
*  They're not going through the State Department which used to be the custom Netanyahu named [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3252.0400000000004s)]
*  Yachiyah lighter to be his ambassador to the US. He is this far-right figure. He's a vocal defender of the Gaza war [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3255.5600000000004s)]
*  He is so supportive of settlements that I think he lives on one in the West Bank [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3262.4s)]
*  He was once part of a radical Jewish nationalist organization called the Jewish Defense League [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3266.06s)]
*  Which was designated a terrorist organization by the US so [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3271.54s)]
*  Great sign there [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3275.22s)]
*  Trump also spoke with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas for the first time since 2017 [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3276.58s)]
*  Abbas reportedly wants to you know, kind of patch things up and try to get on sides [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3281.2999999999997s)]
*  But again, it feels like probably too little too late and ominous for anyone worried about Israeli annexation of the West Bank [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3284.7599999999998s)]
*  So tomorrow when this comes out on November 13th was supposed to be the deadline for this US imposed [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3291.8999999999996s)]
*  Ultimatum on the Israelis to either increase aid to Gaza or potentially face some sort of consequences. Maybe even cutting off of arms [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3298.14s)]
*  According to a report in the Guardian that was based on the Israeli government's own figures [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3306.3399999999997s)]
*  Aid flows into Gaza have dropped to the lowest level since December of last year [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3310.8599999999997s)]
*  In October an average of 57 a trucks per day were allowed into Gaza. The US had demanded [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3315.2599999999998s)]
*  350 per day so way way way below what we'd asked for and like 200 a day was kind of seen as the bare minimum [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3321.06s)]
*  The numbers are even worse in early November [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3327.06s)]
*  8 8 organizations released a report saying that Israel was not complying with the US demands outlined in this letter [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3329.7s)]
*  and they said that northern Gaza was at risk of [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3335.94s)]
*  imminent and substantial likelihood of extreme famine [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3339.38s)]
*  But on Tuesday the Biden administration said the Israeli government is still not in violation of US law and will not be penalized [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3342.14s)]
*  so a fitting end to a [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3350.46s)]
*  feckless policy I [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3353.1s)]
*  There's very little out here [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3355.5s)]
*  Once again, there's an empty threat [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3357.7400000000002s)]
*  Once again, there's no consequences. I don't expect there to be any consequences. This is a huge stain [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3359.86s)]
*  on Joe Biden and his legacy [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3366.06s)]
*  It's almost hard to get your mind around [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3369.5s)]
*  What a catastrophic failure of policy this kind of hug Netanyahu approach was you hugged Netanyahu all the way into the arms of Trump [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3371.9s)]
*  Is essentially what's happened and they're clearly you know, what they're doing in northern Gaza is different than anything they've done before [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3378.6600000000003s)]
*  they're [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3385.7400000000002s)]
*  pursuing a policy that's [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3386.86s)]
*  Depopulation and all these contacts between Nanyang and Trump are probably like what are things that Nanyang can do while Biden's still there [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3388.38s)]
*  Before Trump comes in they may try to maximum [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3396.46s)]
*  Maximize the humiliation of Joe Biden by escalating some of these tactics and then you know when Trump comes in then now can say [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3399.54s)]
*  You know because Trump's here were you know deescalating but they're deescalating after they've already you know [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3406.8999999999996s)]
*  Done their their damage in some of these places. I do think there's still these questions about like who what's the future of Gaza? [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3411.9399999999996s)]
*  Yeah, but but none of this is good. None of this is good. No, it's a it's a moral strategic and now we know a political [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3417.8599999999997s)]
*  catastrophe so all terrible, you know, the Europeans I mean the outgoing foreign policy chief [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3425.3399999999997s)]
*  He has a barrel said it was a he's used the word ethnic cleansing in a tweet about northern Gaza [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3430.2999999999997s)]
*  Also bad, you know more bad news the over the weekend [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3436.06s)]
*  Qatar announced that they are gonna step back from their role of trying to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3438.98s)]
*  The Foreign Ministry basically said like we'll check back in when the party show willingness to end the war or be serious about these talks [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3444.1800000000003s)]
*  And last week we talked about Netanyahu firing the defense minister [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3451.42s)]
*  You have Galant who is seen as a relative moderate in BB's cabinet of right-wing nuts [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3455.34s)]
*  Galant has since said to the media that the IDF has achieved all its goals in Gaza [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3460.98s)]
*  The Netanyahu alone decides whether Israel will cut a hostage deal and he repeated that controlling that border region between Gaza and Egypt [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3466.1000000000004s)]
*  Was not a military necessity. So, you know, he continues to undercut, you know the sort of Netanyahu narrative [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3473.58s)]
*  Part of me then hope thinks that like the only hope for a hostage release deal [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3479.86s)]
*  Might be Netanyahu deciding to deliver one to Trump unlike his first day in office as you know penance for [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3483.6600000000003s)]
*  Congratulating Joe Biden on winning the 2020 election or whatever [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3491.6600000000003s)]
*  I would also be not even a little bit surprised if we someday learn [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3494.38s)]
*  That Trump was pushing BB not to end the war not to cut a ceasefire deal not to get Biden any kind of win [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3498.78s)]
*  Or even to escalate in Lebanon in these closing months of the election [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3505.2200000000003s)]
*  to help aid [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3508.98s)]
*  Him in you know defeating Kamal Harris, but that's pure speculation. Yeah, but pretty you know, pretty good educated guess [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3510.94s)]
*  I will say the one thing about Galant is you know [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3518.04s)]
*  The kind of people that sometimes complained to us that were too hard on the Israeli government and we don't understand the threat Hamas poses [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3520.38s)]
*  Galant is no dove this guy's way to my right and he says that there's no reason for them to be in Gaza anymore [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3526.3s)]
*  You know [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3532.58s)]
*  I don't know what if you are if you're still trying to rationalize that what they're doing in Gaza is about Hamas and not about [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3533.06s)]
*  something else I [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3540.22s)]
*  Direct you to his comments because you know they speak for themselves the people who still reply to like every tweet about Gaza [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3542.06s)]
*  Like this, you know, this could be over tomorrow if Hamas release all the hostages like it's been a year [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3548.74s)]
*  You were just a ghoul if you think that that is still stuck on this you're you're stuck in a rationalization [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3554.22s)]
*  Not yeah [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3559.3399999999997s)]
*  also [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3560.4599999999996s)]
*  Biden was in Biden met with the Israeli president today in the Oval Office a [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3562.54s)]
*  Reporter asked him if he thinks he can get a hostage deal done before his administration's over and Biden's response was quote [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3567.3799999999997s)]
*  Do you think you can get hit in the head by the camera? [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3573.9399999999996s)]
*  Like I don't know. I'm trying to make a joke with the cameraman behind this [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3577.7s)]
*  For like what are we doing here? I don't know what we're doing. I know what we've been doing for the last two years [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3580.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, there you go. That says a lot right there finally, uh, this has been a dark grim [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3587.06s)]
*  episode [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3593.1s)]
*  This election sucks for countless reasons [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3594.22s)]
*  One very very petty one is seeing so many of the worst people in politics get rewarded [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3597.9399999999996s)]
*  Elon Musk's net worth is reportedly up 70 billion dollars with a B since the election all the like crypto [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3604.4599999999996s)]
*  VC guys saw their investments pay off the politicians who shredded their dignity and sucked up to Trump [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3612.74s)]
*  Are all getting rewarded. So it's very very bleak stuff [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3620.2999999999997s)]
*  That doesn't mean we cannot call them out our friend. Mehdi Hassan led the charge against Pierce Morgan [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3623.54s)]
*  Posting two of his tweets. So the first tweet Mehdi posted was from from Pierce Morgan on January 7th, 2021 [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3629.7s)]
*  It read quote if Trump can't be trusted to tweet. He can't be trusted with the nuclear codes [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3636.02s)]
*  He's lost his mind and America needs to get this dangerous diluted despicable lunatic out of the White House now [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3641.22s)]
*  Well said Pierce the second was from November 6 [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3646.2599999999998s)]
*  So a couple days ago it read just spoke to President Trump and congratulated him on the greatest comeback in political history [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3649.48s)]
*  He sounded understandably weary but also utterly elated by the massive scale of his victory [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3654.88s)]
*  And quote. Thank you Pierce Morgan for always speaking truth to power. You're my yeah [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3661.12s)]
*  A lot of dignity on display there across the board, you know, you can tell these people with the congratulations rolling in [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3666.2400000000002s)]
*  You're not taking a long view of things here. They're just in it for the sugar high [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3674.76s)]
*  Okay, I'd say the one thing Tommy [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3680.2400000000002s)]
*  I just want to make one comment which is it like you know, sometimes it's dark and but I do I do want to [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3682.8s)]
*  Just say to our listeners and we'll talk more about this in the weeks to come as we're the full scope of this is sinking [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3687.44s)]
*  And you know, it's important [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3691.92s)]
*  To describe what is happening and to understand what is happening [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3694.2000000000003s)]
*  There's some comfort in that and it's certainly a precursor to doing anything to build back a different kind of foreign policy [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3698.48s)]
*  a different kind of role for the United States [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3705.44s)]
*  And so they see it as empowering to see and understand what these people are doing [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3708.0s)]
*  And not just in a kind of resistance way where we're making fun of things Trump says but what he's doing [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3712.84s)]
*  Because they're gonna want you to tune out and check out and not see how these things all connect and not see how the dots connect [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3718.88s)]
*  And and so I'm grateful for our audience [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3725.12s)]
*  For joining us for this nerdy podcast, but I actually think it's more important than you know [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3728.7200000000003s)]
*  We've had two iterations Trump won Biden to I think that given what's happening in the world [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3734.2599999999998s)]
*  This space is one that we all need to watch and understand and and I don't say I'm looking forward to that [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3739.06s)]
*  Because it's a weird thing to say but I'm committed to doing that with you and all the world is out there [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3745.74s)]
*  Yeah, me too. Well, first of all, well said I don't want to sound too gloomy [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3750.74s)]
*  I do think you're right though when it comes to foreign policy [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3754.54s)]
*  I know everyone's exhausted but it is more important to keep an eye on what's happening in the Trump world this time [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3757.54s)]
*  Because in 2016 he was in aberration, but now he's the latest piece of a broader trend of right-wing populist [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3764.22s)]
*  authoritarians doing well around the world and you know, really we kind of like scoff it, you know references to the [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3771.98s)]
*  Liberal international order given how broken and frayed and flawed it has been when you compare, you know [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3778.98s)]
*  The reaction to Russia compared to Gaza, etc, etc [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3784.2999999999997s)]
*  But we will miss it when it's gone [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3786.8599999999997s)]
*  It's cliche as that sounds and I also think you know, maybe next time we spend some time on this [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3788.74s)]
*  I imagine you talked to Murphy about this about [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3793.18s)]
*  What a better approach on foreign policy might be now that we have we're wiped out and we have a clean slate for example [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3795.66s)]
*  Florida is fucking gone people. So, okay [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3802.3799999999997s)]
*  So let's all Democrats get behind not destroying the economies of Venezuela and Cuba [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3804.9399999999996s)]
*  And other you know [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3811.62s)]
*  Left-wing authoritarian countries by trying to depose leaders that are not going anywhere and we're just harming people and we're causing mass [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3813.46s)]
*  Migration to the United States which Republicans then use and weaponize against us to defeat us in elections. There's a thought [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3821.7s)]
*  I'm not saying you would fix it but but our friend Dan Restrepo [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3828.06s)]
*  Sent me some data that showed I think a quarter of Venezuelans are considering leaving in the near future [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3832.58s)]
*  And this time they're not gonna go to [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3838.58s)]
*  neighboring countries [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3840.98s)]
*  They're far more likely to come to the United States [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3841.86s)]
*  Which is going to exacerbate the border crisis and lead Trump to do even harsher things [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3844.1400000000003s)]
*  So like maybe we get ahead of some of these problems. Yeah, that's right. They are the new establishment [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3849.46s)]
*  MAGA is the new establishment in this country and this kind of populism is the establishment globally and and the only opportunity in that is [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3854.5s)]
*  We can come back with something totally different. Amen [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3861.46s)]
*  Okay, we're gonna take a quick break and we come back you will hear Ben's interview with one of those next-generation leaders [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3864.2400000000002s)]
*  Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut to talk about this election result and how Democrats can start fixing it [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3870.0s)]
*  Stick around for that [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3875.2400000000002s)]
*  If you want to learn more about what this election will mean for the courts check out strict scrutiny where the hosts are breaking down [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3876.04s)]
*  What the election means for the future of the Supreme Court and state courts if you don't know strict scrutiny, you should check it out [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3882.96s)]
*  It's one of the smartest funniest shows I listen to every week [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3889.38s)]
*  You can learn a ton about the legal system without needing a law degree and you also just get a lot of gossip about these [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3893.14s)]
*  Bitchy bitchy people who make judicial rulings and you'll learn about the courts in 2025 [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3898.82s)]
*  So check out strict scrutiny wherever you get your podcasts and it's on YouTube. Okay, I'm very pleased to be joined by the recently re-elected [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3904.06s)]
*  Senator from Connecticut Chris Murphy. I should note we should congratulate you on your [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3912.54s)]
*  Re-election result in which you you perform very well. So that's one thing to feel good about in this election day [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3917.62s)]
*  I still feel good about that. You know, I like this job [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3923.14s)]
*  Well, clearly the people Connecticut feel the same way. So I am so I wanted it, you know [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3927.06s)]
*  We I'll ask you a question or two about some of the things we're seeing out of the Trump transition [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3932.14s)]
*  but before that I really wanted to take this time with you to to step back a little bit and [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3937.98s)]
*  You know consider how we got here and where we go from here [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3942.8199999999997s)]
*  And and we'll get into the foreign policy dynamic [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3946.7000000000003s)]
*  Which I think is an important one that doesn't often get as much attention [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3950.2200000000003s)]
*  But just to set up for people you've been pretty outspoken for a period of years now about [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3952.9s)]
*  The Democratic Party's failure to kind of grapple with the failures of neoliberalism [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3958.34s)]
*  Over decades in terms of alienating communities turning them against establishments [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3962.7000000000003s)]
*  It's certainly a view I share [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3968.2200000000003s)]
*  And [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3970.4199999999996s)]
*  It some of this is unfair we should pause it because a lot of these policies were [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3971.62s)]
*  Ronald Reagan policies and George W. Bush policies and [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3976.2599999999998s)]
*  But we are where we are. And so I just wanted it to give you an opportunity to offer a kind of your framework [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3979.66s)]
*  for the work that the Democratic Party has to do to kind of reckon with the failure of the systems that [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3986.8999999999996s)]
*  Have driven people that otherwise should you know find policies more attractive in the Democratic Party? [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3993.7s)]
*  That is driven them to Trump [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=3999.54s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think you I think alike on on much of this [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4001.7s)]
*  Yeah, listen the the neoliberal project was a bipartisan project and it's sort of broadly described as [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4008.22s)]
*  an enthusiastic embrace of markets as the primary means by which we deliver happiness and meaning to purpose to people's lives [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4014.94s)]
*  Certainly a belief in a global market that eventually would lift all boats [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4023.02s)]
*  a faith in technology as a net positive [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4028.1s)]
*  And then you know a real belief in the hero as the in the individual as a hero [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4032.42s)]
*  at [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4039.62s)]
*  At a cost to the community and the common good [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4040.94s)]
*  I think the liberalism has worked out really badly for the American people folks [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4045.02s)]
*  You saw jobs leave but the good ones didn't show up [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4051.3s)]
*  Local communities got gutted [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4055.62s)]
*  As all that mattered was capital and profit people were left with a real hollowness and emptiness when all that mattered was [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4058.14s)]
*  Profits and caring about the common good was for suckers [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4066.18s)]
*  Technology didn't end up helping most of us. It just further consolidated power and wealth in the hands of [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4070.5s)]
*  Elites and being a global citizen just became really unsatisfactory [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4077.2999999999997s)]
*  People actually want unique local identity, they don't all want to be part of the same thing as everybody else [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4082.18s)]
*  And so what this is all left is a mess [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4090.2599999999998s)]
*  people feeling [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4094.2999999999997s)]
*  Out of control of their lives was subject to these big forces [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4096.0199999999995s)]
*  that are extra territorial and [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4100.86s)]
*  Transnational people feeling lonely and isolated then it's just true. We're spending a lot more time with ourselves [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4104.58s)]
*  And less time with others [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4111.3s)]
*  And feeling you know deeply frustrated with the replacement of citizenship by consumerism [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4113.66s)]
*  Sort of the emptiness that comes with just being viewed as a pawn for other people's profit [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4120.9s)]
*  I think that the Republican Party in some ways has done a much better job of speaking to that loss of meaning and purpose and [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4127.0199999999995s)]
*  identity [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4136.0199999999995s)]
*  Republicans sort of talk about returning control [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4137.139999999999s)]
*  To people's lives and to our common experience. That's the whole parental rights movement that Democrats kind of you know [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4140.78s)]
*  Scoffed at that is their fascination with the border. I mean people can just say it's all about sort of racism and nationalism [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4148.34s)]
*  But it's it's an effort to show people that we actually can control [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4155.179999999999s)]
*  Some things that others might tell us are outside of our control like the increased pace of global migration [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4159.5s)]
*  People like the idea that we can control our border that gives them a sense that you know [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4166.22s)]
*  Oh that these big global forces are are not outside of our of our influence [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4170.66s)]
*  And I think Democrats sort of [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4177.7s)]
*  Decided what was good for people without actually listening to them [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4180.74s)]
*  We sort of engaged in pretty small ball ideas that didn't fundamentally [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4184.3s)]
*  Remove power from the marketplace. We just changed the way that we negotiate for prescription drugs [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4189.34s)]
*  Inside the marketplace we gave people a slightly bigger tax credit [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4195.24s)]
*  If you have kids we you know built some more roads and bridges all that was good stuff [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4199.68s)]
*  but it didn't fundamentally speak to this narrative that people have of [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4204.72s)]
*  control power agency and [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4209.68s)]
*  Isolation and loneliness think Republicans did a much better job of that [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4212.52s)]
*  And I think we have to we have to reconcile that might listen my my recommendation is that we have to [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4215.72s)]
*  Sort of pick fights, you know folks have accrued enormous amounts of power and power is a zero-sum game [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4221.8s)]
*  and so you have to name who has power and who you're gonna take it from as a means to convince people that you're serious about [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4228.48s)]
*  giving it back to them and [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4233.84s)]
*  Second, we just have to become a bigger tent party. I would argue that economic populism in that [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4235.4s)]
*  Effort to try to redistribute power should be the tentpole [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4240.8s)]
*  But we have become you know far too [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4244.08s)]
*  Impermissive far too [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4246.719999999999s)]
*  judgmental of [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4248.28s)]
*  People who may actually line up with us on these sort of big-picture economic issues [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4249.4s)]
*  But don't agree with us on guns or climate or choice and they just right now have no part in our coalition [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4254.04s)]
*  That's a losing strategy. So it's building a bigger tent [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4259.4s)]
*  it's using economic populism at the tent as the tentpole and it's actually thinking about the ways that people are feeling and [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4263.16s)]
*  Tailoring solutions to the way that they're feeling instead of letting these think tanks and interest groups tell us what will help people [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4270.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean one more question on this your state's kind of interesting because you know the one end you have some people have done [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4276.32s)]
*  Quite well, you know in the neoliberal system in certain communities, but then you've got places like Hartford [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4281.04s)]
*  you know that if [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4286.28s)]
*  in [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4287.44s)]
*  Rural areas that are more representative people that probably feel alienated when you when you talk about reconnecting with those people who you've done [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4289.0s)]
*  well with [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4296.92s)]
*  how much of this is a [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4298.08s)]
*  policy that is more populist a [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4300.639999999999s)]
*  Message that kind of meets people more where they are or [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4304.2s)]
*  Just a general sense that we're fighting for you and you know picking fights against corporate malfeasance and against you know [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4308.84s)]
*  People who are rigging the system. What do you see because part of what we've seen failed [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4315.5599999999995s)]
*  I think is to kind of poll tested like here's three policies that you know [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4320.84s)]
*  Focus group really well and we're gonna just talk to you about those it but it doesn't kind of add up to a story [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4325.36s)]
*  What do you think the? [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4329.96s)]
*  The thing is that you found resonated when you're out talking to people [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4331.72s)]
*  Well, let me say this at the outset, you know, listen, obviously I do well in Connecticut Democrats [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4334.84s)]
*  Probably got 55 to 60 percent of the vote in Connecticut, but we lost [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4339.16s)]
*  You know share in those cities in those lower income places [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4343.320000000001s)]
*  And of course the story of this election and in in many ways is that you know in the 10 in the 20 [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4346.84s)]
*  highest median income states [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4353.240000000001s)]
*  Democrats won 18 of them and in the 20 lowest median income states [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4355.4800000000005s)]
*  We won three and so we claimed to be the party of poor people [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4359.76s)]
*  And yet poor people are leaving us in droves. I think it is because we don't talk about power, right? [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4364.320000000001s)]
*  We don't talk about who has it and who doesn't have it [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4370.96s)]
*  we sort of get sucked into these very granular discussions about tax credits and you know, slightly [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4373.84s)]
*  innovative ways to reprice prescription drugs and we don't talk about [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4381.96s)]
*  About who is screwing you and how we are going to address that fundamental [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4385.68s)]
*  That fundamental unfairness we're just sort of not talking in the terms that people [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4392.400000000001s)]
*  Um are are living with today and then I think this is something you said very well. It's it's another hard truth [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4397.280000000001s)]
*  Democrats [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4405.02s)]
*  Are still viewed as the status quo party in part because as we've seen this threat coming to democracy from donald trump [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4406.320000000001s)]
*  Instead of being a different kind of critic of democracy [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4414.0s)]
*  We have become the defenders of a democratic system that is [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4418.32s)]
*  Definitely not working for the people who live in my neighborhood of the south end of harford [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4422.38s)]
*  There's nothing happening in the south end as kids are being shot at as the jobs leave [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4426.88s)]
*  um [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4432.48s)]
*  That says boy this system of government is the one that really works for me [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4433.839999999999s)]
*  And we used to be the critics of democracy, right? [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4438.32s)]
*  We were the ones that that were on the on the cutting edge of reform and critique [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4441.12s)]
*  We are not any longer and that makes us illegitimate in the eyes of many low-income voters [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4447.84s)]
*  Yeah, well, I want to bring this to foreign policy. Um, and you've been a leading voice [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4453.599999999999s)]
*  for I think more progressive approaches to foreign policy [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4459.28s)]
*  and [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4462.72s)]
*  you know [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4463.5199999999995s)]
*  The way I want to bring the question senator is that I remember when joe biden was [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4464.88s)]
*  elected [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4470.24s)]
*  his kind of catchphrase for the first year was america's back, you know, and [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4471.36s)]
*  While I understood the impulse right? You know, we're normal again. We're rejoining agreements like the paris agreement [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4477.839999999999s)]
*  Um, it's people, you know, you know who've been around like tony blinken. Um [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4484.16s)]
*  I also felt like there was something wrong in that message [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4489.2s)]
*  Because i'm not sure americans wanted to go back [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4492.48s)]
*  to um kind of the traditional establishment, uh, [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4495.5199999999995s)]
*  And I say this [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4499.2s)]
*  You know, we all know the individuals. So this is not meant to kind of indict any single individual [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4500.64s)]
*  But but how much we we seem to have carved out in the same way that we became the establishment on other things [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4506.24s)]
*  We very much became the establishment on foreign policy as trump kind of gathered this mountly crew of people [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4512.88s)]
*  That want to tear things down but that have a vision. Uh, america first is a vision. It's a kind of transactionalism [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4517.84s)]
*  It's a but you know reduction in commitments to allies international institutions [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4523.44s)]
*  Um, how much of a reckoning because sometimes I think foreign policy unfortunately gets kind of shunted aside as kind of some elite issue [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4528.58s)]
*  Um, how do we take the kind of populism you described and the kind of reform of neoliberalism [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4535.54s)]
*  You described and apply that to our foreign policy [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4540.639999999999s)]
*  Listen, I I think the biden administration had really good instincts and you saw it in their initial rollout [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4544.66s)]
*  A foreign policy for the middle class kind of a wild way to think about foreign policy [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4549.94s)]
*  But it was this recognition that was not doing a good enough job of selling why america being president of the world actually matters to your life [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4554.18s)]
*  If you're living in gary indiana [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4561.06s)]
*  jake solvents speech at brookings instu where he you know sort of did this broad critique of neoliberalism defended a kind of [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4564.26s)]
*  More responsible version of economic nationalism. I think was right on point [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4571.14s)]
*  But events take over [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4576.34s)]
*  And then all of a sudden you are back in a very familiar pattern [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4578.820000000001s)]
*  Of a getting mired in a part of the world that we seem to never be able to win in and that just [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4583.22s)]
*  Really upsets americans every time that they hear us [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4588.82s)]
*  Lose over and over and over again in the middle east it reminds them of why they don't like being engaged in the world [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4592.5s)]
*  Um, and then a conflict in ukraine that well, you know, it was different from other conflicts. It's familiar to defend europe [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4599.0599999999995s)]
*  Um, you know, there's still all of this hangover from being told [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4607.62s)]
*  That we have essential conflicts to be involved in overseas from iraq to [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4611.700000000001s)]
*  Afghanistan to syria and it never being true almost never being true [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4617.76s)]
*  So I just think you if they had stuck with [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4623.54s)]
*  Right. Everything we're going to talk about in foreign policy is about how it is going to translate to better quality of life [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4627.06s)]
*  For people who live in the middle of america, right our china policy is not about [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4634.18s)]
*  Testing china's influence in southeast asia like nobody gives a shit about that in canton in harford, connecticut [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4638.9800000000005s)]
*  What they do care about is how we're going to make sure that china doesn't capture all the high-tech jobs that we get [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4646.740000000001s)]
*  Those jobs in the united states they they care about [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4652.660000000001s)]
*  china cheating economically on global platforms such that [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4656.900000000001s)]
*  The kind of innovation that we used to rely on [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4662.9800000000005s)]
*  Uh disappears, um, so [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4665.379999999999s)]
*  It's a hard it's a hard message to stick to because events ultimately control [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4669.139999999999s)]
*  But I think you just got to be disciplined about explaining why our china strategy [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4674.099999999999s)]
*  Why you know even our strategy to defend ukraine is ultimately? [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4679.0599999999995s)]
*  Always about your job always about your safety. Do you have a sense though that um [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4683.7s)]
*  There's a way to kind of re [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4691.7s)]
*  I hate the word brand but recalibrate the the party's position on these issues so that [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4694.5s)]
*  There's at least more of a sense of a break from the past [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4699.7s)]
*  You know more of a sense that like we understand that that this kind of certain kind of foreign policy [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4702.099999999999s)]
*  It was kind of a little overly ambitious and shaping outcomes around the world overly engaged in the middle east [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4707.22s)]
*  Kind of overly drawn into kind of forever conflicts, you know [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4711.78s)]
*  Including ukraine in some ways even though you and I share support for ukrainians [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4715.3s)]
*  Is there a way to use this period in opposition? [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4718.9s)]
*  To kind of hit a reset button. Um, so it's not just [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4721.7s)]
*  you know, uh like wholesale reform in other areas but kind of this incrementalism on foreign policy [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4725.62s)]
*  Well, I I wrote a piece very late in the election [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4731.46s)]
*  Um, and it sort of made the case that you know, we should be talking about foreign policy through the prism [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4735.62s)]
*  of breaking up concentrated power [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4741.860000000001s)]
*  and there are and and our foreign policy should be [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4745.22s)]
*  about [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4748.58s)]
*  making decisions that that that contest the rise of these giant multinational corporations that are controlling our lives that are running up costs [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4749.78s)]
*  That are shipping jobs overseas and contesting [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4759.0599999999995s)]
*  consolidated state power and it's not good for any of us if [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4762.32s)]
*  China and russia continue to develop [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4766.42s)]
*  these state-run state controlled [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4768.9s)]
*  uh economies that ultimately hurt american companies and american jobs and so [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4771.2s)]
*  Listen, there are probably a bunch of different ways that you can try to reframe american foreign policy [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4777.06s)]
*  But right now I do think folks. Um, I wish the biden administration had run [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4781.46s)]
*  More on the domestic efforts they were making to break up these big corporations their revitalization of antitrust policies [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4786.5s)]
*  I actually think people get that they like it. It's an us versus that message. It's good versus evil [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4793.620000000001s)]
*  It speaks to their sensibilities about how off kilter this economy has become but you could also talk about [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4798.34s)]
*  Our work in foreign policy through that same prism and it would nicely link together [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4804.5s)]
*  testing consolidated power domestically [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4809.06s)]
*  Republicans are insincere about it democrats are sincere about it and using foreign policy as a mechanism to do the same [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4812.1s)]
*  Um, no, that's a really good frame and that's that's one I think people should take very seriously. Well just before we uh wrap here [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4818.02s)]
*  I mean there are these initial indications of uh personnel on the trump side [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4824.5s)]
*  Including your uh colleague marco rubio's potentially secretary of state [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4828.740000000001s)]
*  Um, uh, alice stephanik at the un, um [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4832.82s)]
*  It's kind of interesting because these are all people who've you know taken the america first pill [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4837.62s)]
*  But they're also people that have kind of neocon tendencies. So as usual, it's kind of strange hybrid. What is your [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4842.82s)]
*  First impression of what you've seen [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4849.3s)]
*  What have we learned about a second trump presidency through these initial at least rumored appointments? [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4851.7s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think you've you've hit it on the the head. Um, you know, these are [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4857.3s)]
*  You know, these are folks who you know have broadly [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4862.42s)]
*  supported [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4866.0s)]
*  Um sort of blind thoughtless american military interventions [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4866.900000000001s)]
*  Abroad who continue to view america's strength in the world solely through the prism of american military [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4870.9800000000005s)]
*  power [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4879.14s)]
*  um, and um [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4880.1s)]
*  You know, it doesn't feel like much of a change from the kind of foreign policy that americans came to hate [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4882.5s)]
*  um, uh, so [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4888.26s)]
*  You know it remains to be seen, you know, whether [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4890.66s)]
*  The previously held views of somebody like marvo rubia will have any [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4893.9400000000005s)]
*  influence over trump [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4897.9400000000005s)]
*  Um, I think they all know what they're in store for which is to you know in the middle east [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4899.7s)]
*  essentially [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4905.38s)]
*  You know outsource policy making to netanyahu in the short run and in the long run just do whatever is best for trump's long-term [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4906.66s)]
*  financial interests and to cut a deal [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4914.64s)]
*  On ukraine that ultimately hands ukraine to [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4918.34s)]
*  To russia. I think trump's been very clear about that and you can listen to marco reveal make [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4922.98s)]
*  You know appearances on cable tv in which he sounds like he wants to defend ukraine, but you wouldn't take that job [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4929.54s)]
*  Uh, unless you understood what trump's all about and trump has made it very clear that he might not even wait until [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4935.22s)]
*  Inauguration day to call up putin and figure out a way to to end that conflict in a way that makes putin very happy [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4940.72s)]
*  I do also think it is really important to understand what the godly principle trump's foreign policy is going to be and it's going to [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4947.7s)]
*  Be trump's pocketbook, right? I mean this is he he and his family are more deeply involved [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4952.099999999999s)]
*  with adversaries and allies [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4958.099999999999s)]
*  His right hand in the white house is elon musk [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4960.419999999999s)]
*  Who is who who has deep business interests with our most serious adversaries? [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4963.62s)]
*  and I think you just have to understand that [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4970.179999999999s)]
*  Musk and trump are likely going to make decisions every day on foreign policy and ask this team to implement those decisions [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4972.58s)]
*  Based upon what makes the two of them the most amount of money as humanly possible. Well, yeah [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4979.3s)]
*  Just to to wind up here on on [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4985.46s)]
*  Because this gets a bit into your role and which is more of an oversight role democrats don't have the majority [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4988.18s)]
*  We've never seen an oligarch quite like elon musk, but it's very familiar [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4994.02s)]
*  You know if you're in certain eastern european countries, you know or turkey or [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=4998.339999999999s)]
*  you know the idea of having the richest guy in the country get on the phone with foreign leaders and [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=5002.9s)]
*  Is not new globally, but it is pretty new here. I mean [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=5007.219999999999s)]
*  And nobody seems to be raising these questions of conflict of interest, you know, he controls starlink. He he you know, obviously has massive interest in [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=5011.139999999999s)]
*  china and other places [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=5017.62s)]
*  Is there anything congress can do to if there's someone who's not confirmed by the senate someone who's kind of outside the org chart [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=5019.54s)]
*  But clearly has massive influence and kind of in oligarch type ways that we've seen and you know places like russia [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=5025.54s)]
*  Is is it what what is your approach as a as a member of the democratic caucus to to address that? [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=5031.86s)]
*  Yeah, I mean this gets back to the critique. I was making before I mean, I think our party has you know with with some exceptions [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=5038.58s)]
*  Like sheldon whitehouse [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=5043.62s)]
*  We've gotten away from you really being [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=5045.3s)]
*  regular opponents and enemies of corruption [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=5048.96s)]
*  Um [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=5051.78s)]
*  and [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=5052.82s)]
*  You know just because you know, a lot of americans have voted for trump kind of know he's corrupt [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=5053.78s)]
*  That doesn't mean that people don't care about it, especially at scale. So yes, I think we have an enormous [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=5058.58s)]
*  oversight role, I I think 99 [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=5064.34s)]
*  percent of americans have no idea about elon musk's [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=5067.62s)]
*  integration into the both chinese and russian [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=5071.76s)]
*  Industrial power structure and that's a story that we haven't told that we are going to have to tell people won't like it when they hear it [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=5076.26s)]
*  And do you think on support to ukraine? Is this is this something where you're at all hopeful that there's [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=5083.22s)]
*  In the first term, you know bipartisan majorities were kind of able to protect support to ukraine [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=5090.26s)]
*  Trump is obviously coming back with much clearer agenda this time and much greater stakes [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=5094.900000000001s)]
*  What's your outlook there? [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=5100.1s)]
*  I mean listen, I just believe what trump said. I don't always believe him, but he was pretty consistent about his [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=5102.0199999999995s)]
*  His unwillingness to even say at the debate that he wanted ukraine to win [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=5109.46s)]
*  The war I see and of course he was the chief opponent [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=5114.099999999999s)]
*  Of the bill to fund ukraine last time around we got it done despite him [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=5118.58s)]
*  So, you know, obviously there are a couple things going on here [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=5123.7s)]
*  We are going to try to get as much aid to ukraine flowing as we can [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31sKlb7dWzs&t=5126.099999999999s)]
