Video Description: Tommy Vietor and Ben Rhodes discuss Telegram founder Pavel Durov’s arrest in France, the debate over free speech, social media, and CEO accountability, as well as why the Russian government finds the app so useful. They also talk about strikes between Hezbollah and Israel and the lonely optimism of the US on a ceasefire deal, a change in US nuclear strategy that refocuses on China, the spread of MPox, protests in India over the rape and murder of a doctor, and some troubling insider knowledge about former Trump officials. Then Tommy speaks to Senator Peter Welch about how Kamala Harris could take a stronger stance on Gaza and what Tim Walz’s gym habits were when they were in Congress together.

# Why Was Telegram’s Pavel Durov Arrested in France?
**Pod Save the World:** [August 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk)
*  Welcome to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Ben Rhodes. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2.0s)]
*  Great to be back in the studio with you. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3.0s)]
*  Nice to be here. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4.5s)]
*  When was the last time we were in the same room? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5.5s)]
*  I don't know. The summer was oddly eventful. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=7.0s)]
*  We were traveling a lot, man. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=9.0s)]
*  It was like family travel, work travel, like stuff like that. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=10.0s)]
*  Conventions. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=12.0s)]
*  I got COVID, like all kinds of stuff. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=13.0s)]
*  Oh, you did get COVID. That sucks. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=15.0s)]
*  I'm shocked I don't have it after being at that DNC. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=16.5s)]
*  Everybody that I talked to at the DNC, like a lot of people got it. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=18.5s)]
*  You're seeing a lot of people be tweeting like, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=21.5s)]
*  if I spoke to you last week, I got some bad news. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=23.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=25.0s)]
*  Speaking of the DNC, Ben, we do have to address the elephant in the room here. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=26.0s)]
*  Which are Dan Pfeiffer's comments from last week. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=30.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=33.5s)]
*  That he believes that the foreign policy section in major speeches [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=34.5s)]
*  is the best time to go pee [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=38.5s)]
*  and that he has never listened to a word you wrote spoken by Barack Obama. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=40.5s)]
*  I have a long history of peeing during foreign policy speeches. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=45.5s)]
*  In fact, I've never heard a word that Ben Rhodes has written. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=47.5s)]
*  How did that make you feel? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=51.0s)]
*  It made me feel very small. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=52.5s)]
*  I almost felt like I could... [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=55.5s)]
*  I almost felt like speech is violence. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=58.5s)]
*  Because there's a glee in Dan's voice. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=63.5s)]
*  All of them at that little table shitting on us. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=65.5s)]
*  And they're all just all just turtling and... [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=68.5s)]
*  Well, first of all, I noticed that the fucking natural security section [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=70.5s)]
*  went down hard, man. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=75.5s)]
*  Like it crushed in the room. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=77.5s)]
*  We sparkled that. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=79.5s)]
*  And I seem to remember Barack Obama [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=80.5s)]
*  giving hundreds of thousands of words that I wrote for him [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=84.5s)]
*  that Dan Pfeiffer apparently was negligent in his job. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=89.5s)]
*  Hated him. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=93.5s)]
*  Because maybe he didn't care about people in other parts of the world. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=94.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=98.5s)]
*  I don't know, Dan. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=99.5s)]
*  I know who did. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=100.5s)]
*  I know who did. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=101.5s)]
*  And now I'm playing my trump card here. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=102.5s)]
*  I'm going there. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=104.5s)]
*  Who? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=105.5s)]
*  Howley loved the national security section of the speeches. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=106.5s)]
*  She would always make a point of saying... [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=108.5s)]
*  Dan's better half. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=109.5s)]
*  Yes, Dan's better half was like a huge world, though, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=110.5s)]
*  proponent of that speech writing. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=113.5s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=116.5s)]
*  You know what, Dan? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=117.5s)]
*  We listen. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=118.5s)]
*  It hurts. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=119.5s)]
*  It hurts. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=120.5s)]
*  The world is listening. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=121.5s)]
*  The world is listening. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=122.5s)]
*  More importantly, the world is listening. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=123.5s)]
*  But you know what, Ben? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=124.5s)]
*  No, it's all right. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=125.5s)]
*  Dan, I will say to Dan's credit, he was a good check on the... [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=126.5s)]
*  Should we have multiple paragraphs on Burma and the State of the Union address? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=133.5s)]
*  It was up to me, sure. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=138.5s)]
*  So you needed Dan Pfeiffer in your life to kind of remind you of the... [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=139.5s)]
*  Listen, yeah. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=142.5s)]
*  If Dan was in the White House right now, we'd probably hear less about AUKUS. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=143.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=146.5s)]
*  So yes, you're right. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=147.5s)]
*  Dan's idea of a national security announcement on a foreign trip was announcing that X country [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=148.5s)]
*  was going to buy X things and created X amount of jobs in the US. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=153.5s)]
*  But it was usually Boeing. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=157.5s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=159.5s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=160.5s)]
*  Listen, we were on board too. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=161.5s)]
*  But Ben, don't look back in anger because Oasis is getting back together for apparently [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=162.5s)]
*  a series of concerts in the UK at least. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=167.5s)]
*  I'm floored by this. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=170.5s)]
*  I was like... [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=171.5s)]
*  Oasis was like the... [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=172.5s)]
*  I was like all in. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=176.5s)]
*  I mean, they were my band. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=177.5s)]
*  They were rock stars. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=178.5s)]
*  From basically the age of, I don't know, 16 to 20. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=179.5s)]
*  I mean, it was like totally formative for me. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=184.5s)]
*  You met my buddy Ryan here in LA, played it with Collective Soul for a while. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=186.5s)]
*  He's a composer. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=190.5s)]
*  He's like obsessed with Oasis. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=191.5s)]
*  So the question I had for him is, so Oasis, it's two brothers, famously hate each other, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=193.5s)]
*  can't speak, broke up... [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=199.5s)]
*  Entertainingly hate each other. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=200.5s)]
*  They hilariously hate each other very publicly on Twitter. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=201.5s)]
*  So much so that they probably left a couple hundred million dollars on the table because [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=206.5s)]
*  they just went on tour. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=211.5s)]
*  A billion dollars on the table. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=212.5s)]
*  Yeah, a billion dollars on the table. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=213.5s)]
*  Do you practice together before to get ready for the tour or is there so much risk of putting [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=214.5s)]
*  those two guys in the same room that you don't let them practice? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=220.5s)]
*  I don't think you let them practice for a minute together because they're not going [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=224.5s)]
*  to be together. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=228.5s)]
*  Because the number of minutes together, there's like a finite number of minutes they can be [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=229.5s)]
*  together without breaking up again. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=232.5s)]
*  And you want to preserve as many of those concerts. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=234.5s)]
*  And they're not that many, right? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=237.5s)]
*  There's some scarcity here. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=238.5s)]
*  It's like, this is not the Arrows tour, but that's by design. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=239.5s)]
*  I think they're aware of the fact they can't do like an Arrows tour because they would [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=242.5s)]
*  basically kill each other by halfway through it. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=245.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=247.5s)]
*  Lee and Gallagher, Noel Gallagher, just, I don't know, do what it takes. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=248.5s)]
*  Get a Xanax prescription. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=252.5s)]
*  Do something to get through this because I want to see this tour. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=253.5s)]
*  I pointed out to you that there was an Oasis during the last Labor government. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=256.5s)]
*  And I didn't do this. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=261.5s)]
*  Someone did this online. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=262.5s)]
*  And then there was no Oasis the entire tour. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=263.5s)]
*  However many fucking prime ministers that was. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=266.5s)]
*  And now we got Labor government, we got Oasis again. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=268.5s)]
*  It's hard to argue with that. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=270.5s)]
*  That's a change I can believe in. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=271.5s)]
*  That is change you can believe in. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=272.5s)]
*  So Tony Blair, Oasis. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=273.5s)]
*  Gordon Brown, Oasis. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=275.5s)]
*  Gordon Brown, Oasis. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=277.5s)]
*  David Cameron, that's when they broke up, right? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=278.5s)]
*  And then now we got Kier Stoner. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=281.5s)]
*  You know who I saw in Chicago briefly is Alastair Campbell, former Tony Blair aide. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=284.5s)]
*  Like the Blair guy. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=290.5s)]
*  Like yeah, the David Axelrod. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=291.5s)]
*  Like the David Axelrod on steroids for Tony Blair, now the host of The Rest is Politics, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=293.5s)]
*  who he co-hosts with Rory Stewart, who's been on the show. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=298.5s)]
*  It's very funny. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=301.5s)]
*  We got lunch in Chicago. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=302.5s)]
*  It's good to hang. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=303.5s)]
*  Do a little World of Time. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=304.5s)]
*  Yeah, I got to do that. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=305.5s)]
*  Dan would have hated our lunch. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=306.5s)]
*  Dan, you know, Dan was sneered. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=308.5s)]
*  We talked about Sue Dan. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=310.5s)]
*  He was sneered at your lunch. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=311.5s)]
*  He would have come up and stood over you and said, when are you going to talk about the middle class? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=312.5s)]
*  Where the green shoots of the economy at this lunch? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=316.5s)]
*  Where is the middle class agenda at this lunch? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=319.5s)]
*  OK, I felt good to get off our chest. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=321.5s)]
*  We both been holding it in. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=324.5s)]
*  We got a good show today. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=325.5s)]
*  We're going to talk about this wild arrest of the founder of Telegram. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=326.5s)]
*  I know you've been following this closely and had some theories, some opinions. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=330.5s)]
*  Got some hot takes on this. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=334.5s)]
*  Hezbollah's long awaited retaliation against Israel. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=335.5s)]
*  Concern of a major polio outbreak in Gaza. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=337.5s)]
*  A huge change in US nuclear policy. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=340.5s)]
*  We're also going to talk about MPOCs in the Democratic Republic of Congo. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=343.5s)]
*  Donald Trump just riffing on foreign policy, national security in his speech. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=346.5s)]
*  Always good for content. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=351.5s)]
*  Monday. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=352.5s)]
*  Yeah, and then some of his former staffers made some big news. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=353.5s)]
*  We'll check in on people like Cash Patel and H.R. McMaster. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=356.5s)]
*  Talk about protests in India and then why some Brits were briefly worried that Darth Vader was invading London. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=359.5s)]
*  So stick around for that. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=366.5s)]
*  And then Ben, I just spoke with Vermont Senator Peter Welch. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=368.5s)]
*  We talked about Gaza. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=371.5s)]
*  We talked about Ukraine. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=372.5s)]
*  And he had some very good advice for how Kamala Harris could signal that she'll do things differently on Gaza. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=374.5s)]
*  Senator Welch has been calling for a ceasefire for nearly a year now. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=380.5s)]
*  He's been talking about conditioning aid to Israel. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=384.5s)]
*  He's clearly very frustrated with how things are going in Gaza and just a principled guy with good advice. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=386.5s)]
*  So do not miss that. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=391.5s)]
*  I love Peter Welch. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=393.5s)]
*  Big fan. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=394.5s)]
*  Good guy. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=395.5s)]
*  And so let's start in France where Pavel Jourov, the founder of the wildly popular messaging app Telegram, was arrested this past weekend at an airport outside of Paris. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=396.5s)]
*  Are American listeners? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=406.5s)]
*  What do you think that like Telegram usage is in the U.S.? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=408.5s)]
*  I don't use it personally, but I know what it is. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=411.5s)]
*  I honestly think that it's probably people in the U.S. communicating with people in other countries. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=414.5s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=419.5s)]
*  I actually got, I mean, my first time using Telegram was just to talk to Russians. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=420.5s)]
*  And when I was working on my last book, every Russian that I talked to, including a lot of Alexei Navalny, but also like writers and everybody was on Telegram. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=424.5s)]
*  So it's it's you know, it's kind of it's ecosystem that kind of built out from Russia. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=432.5s)]
*  Right. You call Progozhin just to check in. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=437.5s)]
*  Yeah, you know, Progozhin and I kind of call me after your flight. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=439.5s)]
*  Message each other. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=442.5s)]
*  Flight ended here. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=443.5s)]
*  Did you see this funny meme? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=444.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=445.5s)]
*  So anyway, you might not have used Telegram if you're an American, but it's wildly popular outside the U.S. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=446.5s)]
*  I think the company says it has 900 million users. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=451.5s)]
*  Those users run the gamut from news outlets, governments, political leaders, dissidents to just, you know, people stay in touch with family and friends. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=454.5s)]
*  And according to the French government, terrorists, groups like ISIS, people looking for child pornography, drug dealers, money launderers and all kinds of bad actors. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=461.5s)]
*  So that gets us to this little crisis here. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=471.5s)]
*  Interestingly, French President Emmanuel Macron apparently uses Telegram on his own device all the time. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=474.5s)]
*  It's interesting given that the arrest happened in France. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=480.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=482.5s)]
*  So they they detained this guy, Pavel Dorov. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=483.5s)]
*  He's not been charged with a crime by French authorities who say he is being held as part of a broader investigation into criminal activity on Telegram. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=487.5s)]
*  So on the platform he founded. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=495.5s)]
*  But this this arrest has pissed off a whole bunch of people from Elon Musk to the Russian government, to Russian opposition leaders. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=497.5s)]
*  Elon and other Silicon Valley types like David Sacks claim this is a crackdown on free speech. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=504.5s)]
*  It's the next shoe to drop after Congress voted to ban TikTok. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=510.5s)]
*  Elon tweeted, quote, POV, it's 2030 in Europe and you're being executed for liking a meme. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=513.5s)]
*  No hyperbole there. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=519.5s)]
*  Yeah. So Ben, Telegram is unique. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=521.5s)]
*  It's based out of Dubai. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=523.5s)]
*  It's like one of only a few apps that is not U.S. or Chinese based. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=524.5s)]
*  It's very popular in Russia where this free speech app is, you know, ironically, there is no freedom of speech in Russia. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=528.5s)]
*  Ben, let's start with the sort of like philosophical question or these claims by people like Elon. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=534.5s)]
*  Like, do you think this is an attack on free speech? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=538.5s)]
*  Is this a free speech issue? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=541.5s)]
*  How are you viewing this arrest currently? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=542.5s)]
*  Yeah, I think it is. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=544.5s)]
*  I mean, I don't agree that it foreshadows executions in the streets of Europe for me. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=546.5s)]
*  For me. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=551.5s)]
*  I love it's a bad meme. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=552.5s)]
*  But, you know, based on what the French have said thus far, I mean, they are holding a CEO accountable for content posted on his platform, not for something he posted or did. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=553.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=567.5s)]
*  And that inevitably hits directly at this intersection of what is the accountability responsibility liability for a tech company and its owner or, you know, board in some cases for what's on on their platforms. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=568.5s)]
*  And, you know, that that's a really important issue. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=585.5s)]
*  And I think there are free speech equities in that question because, you know, the defense of these platforms is always that we're not a media company ourselves generating content. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=588.5s)]
*  We're just a platform for it. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=599.5s)]
*  So if you start regulating us, you inherently are getting into speech questions. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=600.5s)]
*  And I think that is objectively true. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=605.5s)]
*  It's also objectively true that, well, why should you be able to commit crimes just because it's on a social media platform? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=607.5s)]
*  The problem and the obvious challenge with this and before I get to my kind of more conspiracy theory minded hot takes is like, why is Mark Zuckerberg not get arrested? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=614.5s)]
*  What do you mean? I've seen the throne meet with McCrone laws meeting tech guys. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=626.5s)]
*  I've seen him meet with I think Elon. I've seen him meet with Zuckerberg. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=631.5s)]
*  And I'd like the friend I'd like to know why the French government believes that Telegram is uniquely somehow different than Facebook or X. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=634.5s)]
*  Maybe it is very well maybe, you know, maybe that they it is a bit of a Wilder West. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=647.5s)]
*  You know, I think Facebook does go out of its way on things like child pornography. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=652.5s)]
*  And so there is more content moderation on American platforms. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=656.5s)]
*  I'm not trying to do a total everybody does this thing. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=659.5s)]
*  But the question then is like, what is the line like what line is French or French authorities trying to define that has been crossed? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=662.5s)]
*  And why is Telegram uniquely accountable in a way that Facebook is? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=670.5s)]
*  Yeah, just real quickly on other companies. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=676.5s)]
*  It has been an interesting couple of weeks for social media companies generally. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=678.5s)]
*  I mean, you got Elon Musk in this big fight with the British government, which was blaming Twitter for inciting these those far right mobs that were in the streets and rioting after that horrible stabbing of a couple young girls at the Taylor Swift themed dance class. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=682.5s)]
*  This week, I think yesterday, Mark Zuckerberg sent a letter to Jim Jordan, the Republican in the House, saying that Facebook had been pressured to censor some COVID-19 content during the pandemic. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=698.5s)]
*  He now says he would push back. That happened again. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=711.5s)]
*  He also bent the knee by saying he would no longer donate money to help election officials prepare for elections. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=714.5s)]
*  This was Zuckerberg's foundation with his wife. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=720.5s)]
*  They gave like 400 million to help elections prepare to deal with voters during the pandemic. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=723.5s)]
*  And they also said that censoring the Hunter laptop stories were a mistake. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=730.5s)]
*  I agree with them there. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=734.5s)]
*  But there's been all this sort of churn moving sort of in the Republican direction. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=735.5s)]
*  Casey Newton, a platformer, had an interesting piece on Telegram where he said basically Telegram's terms of service prohibit users from posting illegal pornographic content in public channels or promotion of violence in public channels. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=740.5s)]
*  But their terms of service sort of like implicitly apply that it's fine in private communications and that they set up the company in such a way where they can avoid law enforcement asks and they kind of brag about refusing to engage or help take things down or deal with, I don't know, criminal cases. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=756.5s)]
*  So I think that's probably the material difference. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=775.5s)]
*  It's likely like the French said Telegram give us X, Y, or Z, and they have refused. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=778.5s)]
*  And they're like, all right, buddy. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=783.5s)]
*  Fine. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=784.5s)]
*  Now we got you. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=785.5s)]
*  Now we're going to get. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=786.5s)]
*  Now you can't leave. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=787.5s)]
*  Yeah, I think I mean, because in my own view of this, you know, is obviously there has to be some content moderation for certain legal activity. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=788.5s)]
*  But also, like the sometimes the content moderation discussion weirdly ends up lowering the bar on the tech companies because the real problem is the algorithms. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=797.5s)]
*  So the real problem is that every one of these companies has a social media platform. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=807.5s)]
*  The algorithm is written in a way to kind of mainline anger, grievance and allow disinformation to travel farther. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=811.5s)]
*  That's a whole other question with the wiring of these things in the question of like, what are the French concerned about? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=817.5s)]
*  You know, the one thing I was thinking was that France has been a massive target of Russian disinformation, misinformation and just kind of negative information around the French Olympics. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=822.5s)]
*  And the reason why is because the Russians were kicked out of the Olympics. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=836.5s)]
*  And so they basically wanted to kind of help, you know, try to ruin the Paris Olympics. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=841.5s)]
*  Yeah. No. And so I've talked to a lot of people who kind of analyze Russian disinformation. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=845.5s)]
*  And you saw everything from like a fake A.I. Tom Cruise narrated like movie about like the corruption of the Olympics. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=849.5s)]
*  You saw we talked about on this podcast member a lot of you know, a lot of the anti-Ukrainian disinformation. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=858.5s)]
*  There were bank shots into France. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=865.5s)]
*  Like remember that they said that Ukrainians were going to assassinate Macron. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=867.5s)]
*  Right. And so I wonder if the French got increasingly annoyed because a lot of the Russian disinformation. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=870.5s)]
*  Did they do the opening ceremony? Were they that blue guy? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=878.5s)]
*  You know, I don't know who the blue guy was, but a lot of the Russian disinformation in recent years, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=880.5s)]
*  what the Russian government does and the Russian kind of troll farms do is it starts on Telegram. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=887.5s)]
*  So they the first and Wagner Group does this to like the first shit they post. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=892.5s)]
*  And it's kind of funny because the Navalny people also like post on Telegram. Right. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=896.5s)]
*  So it's open to everybody. But the Russians will get something kind of going on Telegram. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=900.5s)]
*  So you get it some traction and then it kind of jumps over into, you know, Metta, WhatsApp, X, et cetera. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=904.5s)]
*  And so I am curious, you know, if if some of the French government's motivation is they've kind of been the target of a lot of crap on Telegram in the last year or two. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=911.5s)]
*  But also, like they start pulling the thread. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=921.5s)]
*  Like the relationship, what's the relationship between the Russian government and Telegram? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=925.5s)]
*  Like like there there's all this becomes one of those massive legal things. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=929.5s)]
*  Like there's a lot we could maybe learn whether you agree with the detention or not. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=933.5s)]
*  And I have a lot of reservations about it because it just feels pretty dramatic without a lot of explanation. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=939.5s)]
*  But we could try to understand that better, too. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=946.5s)]
*  Well, that's an interesting point. So this guy, Pavel Derov, he's an interesting character slash kind of like peak Silicon Valley, bro. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=949.5s)]
*  He's 39 years old. He's reportedly worth over nine billion dollars. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=957.5s)]
*  Before Telegram, he founded a company called VK, which is basically like a kind of Russian clone of Facebook. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=961.5s)]
*  He fled Russia for Dubai in 2014 after being after being pressured to hand over data to the Russian government or shut down pages of opposition leaders. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=966.5s)]
*  So he wound up in Dubai. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=976.5s)]
*  But he loves to like post photos of himself shirtless on Instagram looking admittedly pretty shredded. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=978.5s)]
*  Good for you. He also claims to have fathered more than 100 kids because he's a sperm donor. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=984.5s)]
*  So he's got the Elon Musk populate the world. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=990.5s)]
*  Yeah, he says the his sorry his women want his quote high quality jeans is what he says. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=992.5s)]
*  So he's in the Elon Musk thing where he's like worried about the declining birthrate and happy to help out. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=998.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of like that was dabble in some light eugenics. Yeah. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1003.5s)]
*  You know what I mean? And world domination. Yes. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1006.5s)]
*  Yeah. And if you read Walter Isaacson's book, there's a lot in there about how Elon thinks his father, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1008.5s)]
*  being a bad guy, screwed him up. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1013.5s)]
*  There's less thinking about whether having a bunch of kids and abandoning them might screw them up, too. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1015.5s)]
*  But but we digress. So when this comes out, then they will either have the French will have to have charged her up with a crime or released him based on their law. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1021.5s)]
*  They have to release him on Wednesday. It's Tuesday right now. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1030.5s)]
*  So we'll know more. But there is the question you raised just now is what is the relationship between Telegram and the Russian government? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1033.5s)]
*  Because if they didn't find Telegram useful in some way, the Russian government would shut it down. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1042.5s)]
*  But it's all over the place. And the question is why? [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1047.5s)]
*  Oh, and one other thing before we get to that question, here's a clip of here's a clip of Pavel Dura of talking with Tucker Carlson on his show about sort of his concern about government and authority. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1051.5s)]
*  So one of the things we learned when Elon Musk bought Twitter is that the Intel agencies, not just US, but a bunch of other countries, the usual suspects, were all over the company. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1063.5s)]
*  I mean, they were some of them were present working at the company. They had access to the direct messages. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1074.5s)]
*  You can just imagine, you know, because you run one. But the wealth of data flowing through would be of great interest to to governments. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1078.5s)]
*  Does that make you paranoid that you'll be penetrated? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1088.5s)]
*  I mean, I assume governments would like to know what's going on for privately on Telegram. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1091.5s)]
*  Well, there's definitely a lot of responsibility that we have on our shoulders. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1098.5s)]
*  And we I would say we are paranoid, but I think it makes sense to stay prudent and not being too accessible, not traveling to weird places. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1102.5s)]
*  You don't travel to weird places? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1117.5s)]
*  I hope not. Like I travel to places where I have confidence that those places are consistent with what we do and our values. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1119.5s)]
*  I don't go to any of the big geopolitical powers of the countries like China or Russia or the US. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1133.5s)]
*  You don't go to the US? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1141.5s)]
*  I try not to. I can go, but it's too much attention like I described before. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1143.5s)]
*  Travel risk analysis is a touch off. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1149.5s)]
*  Anyway, back to this question of the connection with Russia. What do you think? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1151.5s)]
*  I think it's a most interesting question at the heart of all this. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1154.5s)]
*  And look, I don't know what he might have, you know, the question of what kind of personal contacts or communications he's had with the Russian government. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1156.5s)]
*  You know, he's also clearly feels paranoid about them. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1164.5s)]
*  So I'm not suggesting, you know, he's like Putin's inner circle in any way. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1168.5s)]
*  He's been an antagonist. He's had to leave the country. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1172.5s)]
*  But what's interesting is what does the Russian government get out of the existence of Telegram? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1175.5s)]
*  Because it wouldn't exist if they didn't want it to. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1180.5s)]
*  You know, if they wanted to shut down Telegram in Russia, they would shut down a long time ago. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1182.5s)]
*  And I think they get a couple of things out of it. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1187.5s)]
*  Like I said, they clearly get to use it as a kind of laboratory to test out their information campaigns and see how they get traction, to get attraction. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1192.5s)]
*  And I'm sure that Telegram knows about that and clearly does nothing about that. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1203.5s)]
*  But then also the Ukrainians use Telegram. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1209.5s)]
*  The Navalny operation uses Telegram. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1212.5s)]
*  And on the one hand, that's good for them that they have these platforms. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1214.5s)]
*  And that's why you saw like Alexei Navalny's chief of staff, Leonid Volkov, who's been on this podcast. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1217.5s)]
*  He came out in support of Pavel Burei yesterday. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1220.5s)]
*  But it's also useful for the Russians to be able to monitor all that. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1224.5s)]
*  And not in, I mean, it sounds strange to say, not even in like some extrajudicial way, but just there's an information ecosystem they can watch and manipulate that is closer to home. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1229.5s)]
*  Right. It's probably an easier information set for them to get their arms around, in some cases even than foreign run platforms. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1239.5s)]
*  And so, you know, what the I find it almost hard to believe there's no interaction between the Russian government and people at Telegram. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1247.5s)]
*  But we don't know. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1258.5s)]
*  But if you start pulling the thread, if this becomes turns into some major litigation, we might learn something. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1261.5s)]
*  Yeah, interesting. Also, you said Pavel Burei there. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1266.5s)]
*  Oh, sorry. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1269.5s)]
*  Which amazing hockey player. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1270.5s)]
*  Wait, wait. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1272.5s)]
*  It became the Russian rocket. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1273.5s)]
*  Keep this in because it does date me as when I was following hockey. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1274.5s)]
*  Yeah, he's 53. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1279.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1280.5s)]
*  So he was on a Canuck. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1281.5s)]
*  He was really good in like NHLPA 94, 95. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1282.5s)]
*  Dude, this is why. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1286.5s)]
*  Because that was obsessed with that video game. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1288.5s)]
*  And he had the classic, you know, you come down and get the one pass to the middle. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1290.5s)]
*  Boom. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1294.5s)]
*  One timer. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1295.5s)]
*  Because Pavel Burei was a fast one timer. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1296.5s)]
*  So fast. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1298.5s)]
*  Get in there right next to the goal. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1299.5s)]
*  Boom. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1300.5s)]
*  Great hockey player. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1301.5s)]
*  All right. Sorry. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1302.5s)]
*  Good correction. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1303.5s)]
*  How do we pivot to Israel? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1304.5s)]
*  Let's just do it. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1306.5s)]
*  Let's turn to Israel, Ben. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1307.5s)]
*  Where for weeks they have been waiting to see what Hezbollah was going to do. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1309.5s)]
*  Maybe even Iran in response to Israel's assassination of a senior Hezbollah commander in Beirut several weeks ago now. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1314.5s)]
*  Was it last month? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1320.5s)]
*  I don't even remember. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1321.5s)]
*  Time is like years or in weeks. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1322.5s)]
*  Three presidential candidates ago. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1325.5s)]
*  On Sunday, the response. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1327.5s)]
*  Pre-Tim Waltz. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1329.5s)]
*  Pre-Tim Waltz. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1330.5s)]
*  That finally happened. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1331.5s)]
*  So this was Sunday. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1332.5s)]
*  The back and forth started with Israel sending 100 warplanes into the air to launch preemptive strikes on what the IDF described as 40 Hezbollah rocket launch sites. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1334.5s)]
*  Hezbollah says they launched 340 rockets at military sites in Israel. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1344.5s)]
*  Though it seems like those strikes did very little damage because of the preemptive Israeli action and their missile defense systems, which are very effective. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1349.5s)]
*  Normally with these kinds of rocket attacks, Hezbollah targets northern Israel. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1358.5s)]
*  But this time they fired at sites in central Israel. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1362.5s)]
*  So they're extending their range specifically at a military base that serves as the headquarters of Unit 8200, which does signals intelligence for the IDF. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1364.5s)]
*  It's basically like the Israeli military's version of our NSA. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1373.5s)]
*  An Israeli sailor was killed by shrapnel from an air defense interceptor missile. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1377.5s)]
*  But that's the only casualty I've read about. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1382.5s)]
*  So Ben, I mean, once again, you have these like major escalations. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1384.5s)]
*  You have very effective missile defense systems limiting the damage, limiting the casualties. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1388.5s)]
*  Now both sides do seem to want to de-escalate, which is good. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1395.5s)]
*  But we're still like at a place where there's no progress in ceasefire talks. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1399.5s)]
*  There's no, you know, nothing's going well in Gaza, nothing that would end the fighting and get Hezbollah or the Houthi rebels in Yemen to stand down for good. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1404.5s)]
*  And so I worry we're almost getting we're getting numb or used to the risk of these massive escalations that would have been historic. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1412.5s)]
*  Yeah. You know, a year ago. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1420.5s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it was striking that both what Hezbollah wanted to do and what they did and what Israel did, you could feel it being within this kind of containment paradigm. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1422.5s)]
*  You know, like it felt like everybody wanted to make clear that this is another short term exchange of fire, not the beginning of something new. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1434.5s)]
*  And Hezbollah wanted to send enough rockets that it didn't feel like a normal rocket attack, but not so many rockets that, you know, Lebanon gets invaded by Israel. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1442.5s)]
*  And Israel wanted to, you know, do enough damage to Hezbollah to diminish their capacity to hit. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1451.5s)]
*  But they're not really setting back Hezbollah like comprehensively. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1458.5s)]
*  So it's all in this kind of strange calibration, the kind of the insanity of war, you know, like how much, you know, how many rockets do we have to fire for it to be credible? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1462.5s)]
*  And how many rockets do we have to blow up from Israel? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1472.5s)]
*  Look, you summed it up well. I mean, what I take away from this is Israel has this kind of tactical advantage on both Hezbollah and Iran, you know, because of their missile defense systems principally and because of some of their, you know, offensive capabilities. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1475.5s)]
*  And intel, clearly they like to do this. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1491.5s)]
*  And they're deep into, yeah, they clearly deeply penetrated, you know, Lebanon. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1493.5s)]
*  They have an ability to kind of punch Hezbollah or Iran harder than Hezbollah and Iran punched back. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1498.5s)]
*  But at the same time, that tactical military advantage doesn't add up to some large strategic advantage for Israel. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1506.5s)]
*  Yeah, good point. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1515.5s)]
*  Because it's still got Gaza. It's still internationally isolated. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1516.5s)]
*  It's still got, you know, whole populations of towns in northern Israel have been, you know, have been removed. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1521.5s)]
*  150,000 people displaced on both sides. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1531.5s)]
*  Kids are missing schools. Communities are never going to return to what they were. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1533.5s)]
*  You know, this allows Bibi to kind of look like, you know, he's this guy's swinging some punches at everybody, at Hamas, at Hezbollah, at Iran. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1537.5s)]
*  And yet, can we say that Israel today that this is all adding up to making Israel like safer, more secure, more successful? [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1546.5s)]
*  No, you know, so it's a kind of strange dynamic where I don't see their advantage leading to some outcome. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1553.5s)]
*  And as long as Gaza is going on, we're just kind of, like you said, peculiarly living with this tinderbox catching on fire. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1561.5s)]
*  And we just hope it doesn't blow up, you know, and to your point on things not changing in Gaza. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1568.5s)]
*  I mean, there's some like there's some important updates. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1572.5s)]
*  I mean, the idea of rescue to 52 year old Israeli Arab man from a tunnel in southern Gaza today, Tuesday. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1576.5s)]
*  That's a great thing. This is the only eight hostage rescued alive since the war started. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1583.5s)]
*  The IDF seems to have found him by chance as they were looking for Hamas fighters. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1588.5s)]
*  His name is Farhan Al-Khadi. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1593.5s)]
*  He'd been working as a security guard on the Israeli kibbutz near the border when he was captured. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1595.5s)]
*  So that's obviously amazing. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1600.5s)]
*  However, the doctors have now confirmed the first case of polio in Gaza. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1602.5s)]
*  A 10 month old child caught the disease and that is now paralyzed in one leg. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1606.5s)]
*  So a bunch of health organizations are desperately trying to put together a vaccination program. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1610.5s)]
*  They got one point two million vaccine doses arrived in Gaza on Monday, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1614.5s)]
*  but distributing them in an active war zone where you don't know where anyone is. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1618.5s)]
*  I mean, normally you just go house to house to house and you give them one dose. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1622.5s)]
*  And three weeks later, you give them the second. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1625.5s)]
*  I don't know how you do this in IDP camps where people are getting pushed around all the time. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1627.5s)]
*  And that's why you see a lot of these medical groups are calling for basically a temporary vaccine ceasefire to do this work. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1631.5s)]
*  UNICEF says at least 95 percent of kids in Gaza need to get two doses of the polio vaccine to prevent them catching and spreading the disease. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1640.5s)]
*  If outbreak occurs, it will almost certainly spread outside of Gaza and into Israel. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1648.5s)]
*  So it's a disaster. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1652.5s)]
*  The other part about this, like everything's worse. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1653.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1655.5s)]
*  And then you read about the current talks and you read these quotes or you listen to international news. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1656.5s)]
*  And the only ones expressing optimism are American officials and everyone else. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1660.5s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1664.5s)]
*  Really just like really just Tony Blinken and John Kirby. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1665.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's like there's like happy talk. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1668.5s)]
*  Joe Biden. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1670.5s)]
*  Joe Biden. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1671.5s)]
*  Joe Biden predicting. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1672.5s)]
*  How many times Joe Biden come out and said we're just about to get the ceasefire done? [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1674.5s)]
*  Ramadan a couple of weeks ago. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1678.5s)]
*  Ice cream, NATO summit. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1680.5s)]
*  So I don't know, man. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1681.5s)]
*  Why? [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1682.5s)]
*  Why do we think that's happening? [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1684.5s)]
*  Why is there so much optimism but no policy change do you think? [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1685.5s)]
*  I'll give you a less cynical answer than the cynical answer. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1692.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1694.5s)]
*  The less single answer is that they're working really hard. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1695.5s)]
*  They have to look like there's progress because they want to keep the pressure on the parties. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1699.5s)]
*  And there are a lot of people who are exhausting every effort. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1704.5s)]
*  The cynical answer is if it looks like there's a process, it's less of like a news story. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1709.5s)]
*  That's true. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1717.5s)]
*  That basically it's like what's we have to have an answer to the question of what are you doing about Gaza? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1718.5s)]
*  And when you're essentially not doing anything in terms of exerting leverage on the Israelis, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1723.5s)]
*  the only thing you can be doing is trying to get a ceasefire. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1728.5s)]
*  And this is kind of the cynical truth is it's kind of worked. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1731.5s)]
*  Gaza is kind of off the front page. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1735.5s)]
*  Every incoming question is answered with, well, we're working really hard and we're optimistic about the ceasefire. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1738.5s)]
*  And then there's these efforts to blame Hamas for everything, [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1745.5s)]
*  even though we increasingly have learned that usually these things, BB comes in and changes the terms. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1749.5s)]
*  And I think it's really, really frustrating because it's just hard to take seriously at this point when you kind of keep having the same meetings. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1756.5s)]
*  And meanwhile, you mentioned Polio. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1765.5s)]
*  Part of what people are missing here is that this may not be on the front page, but it is it's not like it's any better. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1767.5s)]
*  It's worse in Gaza than it was a month ago, two months ago, three months ago. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1772.5s)]
*  And this is not like I actually don't like how much there's been a focus on the ceasefire, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1776.5s)]
*  because even if there is a ceasefire, all of Gaza is completely destroyed. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1781.5s)]
*  Probably many more than 40,000 people have been killed. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1786.5s)]
*  But then how many people have our amputees? [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1791.5s)]
*  How many people are orphans? How many polio malnutrition? [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1795.5s)]
*  Like this entire population is being like pulverized in ways that they will deal with for the rest of their lives. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1798.5s)]
*  There's not a single person in Gaza who's not been deeply traumatized and touched. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1805.5s)]
*  But their house got blown up, their parents got killed, they got wounded, they had polio, they're at malnutrition. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1810.5s)]
*  And that's just that's not going to go away because there's a ceasefire. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1816.5s)]
*  Like Gaza Strip is unlivable. Yeah. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1820.5s)]
*  And so there's no sanitation. There's no infrastructure. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1822.5s)]
*  There's no water. And this whole conversation becomes it's it's an easier story to cover. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1824.5s)]
*  As somebody who listens to Up First and NPR in the morning, reads New York Times. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1830.5s)]
*  Exactly. Like there are another round of talks in Qatar. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1836.5s)]
*  And the Egyptians said this and the Americans said that. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1839.5s)]
*  But the Israelis said that. And you know, Brock Ravid, Siren on Twitter. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1842.5s)]
*  Like there's going to be another round of talks. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1846.5s)]
*  That's an easier story to tell than the story of what's actually happening in Gaza. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1848.5s)]
*  Or the question about, well, after there's a ceasefire, then what happens in Gaza? [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1853.5s)]
*  And so this whole thing is peculiar to become about these talks and not about like what is actually happening. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1858.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's a really good point. Because, yeah, that and that's the hard part for Kamala Harris. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1863.5s)]
*  I mean, we might get a ceasefire. We might end the war with a long term challenge. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1867.5s)]
*  If she gets elected, Gaza is going to be as big a challenge the next day, even if there's a ceasefire in place. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1872.5s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. OK, we're going to take a quick break and we come back. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1878.5s)]
*  We're going to talk about a major change in U.S. nuclear policy. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1881.5s)]
*  All right, Ben, after that that quick break, faster than a Pave-au-Barre. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1885.5s)]
*  Yeah, one timer. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1888.5s)]
*  If you can get your hands on NHLPA 94, those one timers are just you can't defend against it. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1890.5s)]
*  I love that game. Yeah. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1895.5s)]
*  Speaking of one timers, let's talk about nuclear weapons. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1896.5s)]
*  I got one for you. While Pave-au-Barre may be the focus of this conversation, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1899.5s)]
*  it's no longer just Russia that's the focus of American nuclear weapons policy. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1904.5s)]
*  That's good. That's good. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1907.5s)]
*  So big picture, Ben, that we're keeping all this in. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1909.5s)]
*  Under you and I talked about this, but I think an under discussed sort of tragedy of the Trump era was the death of arms control. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1912.5s)]
*  Yes, pretty big fucking deal. Pulled out of the Iran deal. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1919.5s)]
*  They pulled that of the the INF Treaty, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1921.5s)]
*  The Trump people gave up on efforts to extend the New START Treaty, which is like the only remaining [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1926.5s)]
*  treaty in the world that limited the number of deployed nuclear weapons in the U.S. and Russia. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1932.5s)]
*  So Biden gets in. He extends New START. That was a good thing. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1936.5s)]
*  But the more recently, the entire arms control paradigm has shifted because of China and their rapid development of nuclear weapons, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1939.5s)]
*  which gets us to last week. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1947.5s)]
*  So the New York Times reports that the U.S. has reoriented its entire the entire nuclear deterrent strategy to take China into account. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1949.5s)]
*  Officials are worried that on the current path, China could end up with about the same number of deployed nuclear weapons as the U.S. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1957.5s)]
*  and about the same number of intercontinental ballistic missiles by like, you know, 2030. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1964.5s)]
*  So very bad news. And then there was a quote from a top arms control official on Biden's NSC who said, quote, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1968.5s)]
*  Where is it? Who said, quote, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1975.5s)]
*  Absent a change in the trajectory of adversary arsenals, we may reach a point in the coming years where an increase from current deployed numbers is required. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1978.5s)]
*  In other words, we will start to reverse the progress made by New START in arms control treaties in decades of work from Ronald Reagan until now. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1986.5s)]
*  So Ben, this is complicated because China reportedly refuses to engage on arms control talks until they feel like they've achieved some parity. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=1994.5s)]
*  I don't know if that's true. That's what I've read. I saw Jake Sullivan, I think, in China now meeting with their national security adviser. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2005.5s)]
*  So maybe this is coming up. So we'll see. But I'm curious, like, given how much time we spent on arms control and New START and how this is such a priority for President Obama. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2011.5s)]
*  I mean, how significant do you think these reports and quotes are about the U.S. reorienting towards China and potentially talking about producing more nukes? [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2019.5s)]
*  It's super alarming. And I mean, first of all, the background is that China's long had a nuclear weapons arsenal. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2030.5s)]
*  But the perception was it was kind of a minimalist arsenal. They had just enough to make people back off. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2039.5s)]
*  You know, we have enough nuclear weapons essentially to blow you up. So don't don't think about taking a shot at us like the French, like a couple hundred. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2046.5s)]
*  Yeah, which, by the way, is like what I've never fully understood why we need unless we literally think we're going to fight and win a nuclear war or why we need, you know, tens of thousands of nuclear weapons. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2053.5s)]
*  So China's had this nuclear arsenal, but they never even the Obama years, we were trying to kind of begin to multilateral arms control, bring them into conversations. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2062.5s)]
*  And the Chinese have been fairly resistant to joining arms control talks beyond they're in the nonproliferation treaty. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2069.5s)]
*  They're they're signatories to all the kind of major pieces of the origins of arms control. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2077.5s)]
*  That said, you're right. Like the arms there is no arms control anymore. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2083.5s)]
*  Right. And the U.S. is as if not more responsible for that than anybody else. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2087.5s)]
*  You know, between George W. Bush and Trump, just tearing up a whole bunch of agreements. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2093.5s)]
*  I don't understand why this isn't a bigger deal. I know I'm here like to be for the arms control geeks out there. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2097.5s)]
*  You know, we lived through the Cold War and like people on both sides decided, hey, we can't live without a lot of arms. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2107.5s)]
*  This is crazy. You know, dating back to John F. Kennedy after the Cuban Missile Crisis, like, wait a second. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2115.5s)]
*  And Kennedy calls for the comprehensive test, Ben treaty, right. Banning on nuclear weapons testing. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2121.5s)]
*  And then ever since then, like Nixon had detente and they had the salt treaty and then fucking Ronald Reagan almost agreed to destroy all nuclear weapons of Gorbachev, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2125.5s)]
*  bans intermediate range nuclear weapons, you know, deep cuts after the Cold War. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2135.5s)]
*  Obama builds on this. And this is the biggest issue. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2140.5s)]
*  Like when I had COVID, one of the things I did is I watched like the day after that 80s movie about like what happens in a nuclear war. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2143.5s)]
*  A hundred million Americans watched this movie. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2150.5s)]
*  You're in a dark place. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2152.5s)]
*  I was in a pretty dark place. I was writing about Reagan and arms control. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2153.5s)]
*  So I genuinely think that this needs to be a much bigger concern because we now have three countries, the United States, Russia and China. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2157.5s)]
*  That have like removed guardrails from their nuclear modernization and they're building their nuclear arsenals without an arms control framework around it. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2169.5s)]
*  You know, and this is I think what's important for people to understand is like part of what arms control does is yet try to keep the numbers down of the weapons. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2180.5s)]
*  But it also it's like you can't deploy certain range missiles that basically you can't be trying to win a nuclear war and what you're doing. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2186.5s)]
*  You know, you want to have a kind of parody that everybody can chill out. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2196.5s)]
*  And I'm really worried. One, it's just costly as hell. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2199.5s)]
*  Like it's going to cost trillions of dollars that the US starts to feel like they were back in a nuclear arms race. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2202.5s)]
*  We already are spending too much on this. But also it's just dangerous as hell. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2207.5s)]
*  You know, why in the Cold War were we like, yeah, it's not OK. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2211.5s)]
*  We need to sit down and have all these treaties. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2215.5s)]
*  But we feel better today with like Putin and Xi Jinping and fucking Donald Trump in this country. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2217.5s)]
*  Like, let's get some treaties around this stuff. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2224.5s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's one thing when it's two countries trying to achieve parity. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2226.5s)]
*  When you throw a third in there, it gets incredibly complicated. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2229.5s)]
*  I mean, we've all watched half of one episode of The Three Body Problem and then gave up on it. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2232.5s)]
*  You know, we get it. Well, with the North Korea sitting there and the Iranians are on the doorstep and the Israelis have. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2237.5s)]
*  Right. I mean, this is a mess. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2242.5s)]
*  And because it's hard and yeah, the Chinese are resistant. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2244.5s)]
*  I don't think that's enough of an answer. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2247.5s)]
*  I think, you know, you have to just try to insist that arms control is going to be on the agenda. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2249.5s)]
*  And by definition, arms control is something you do with adversaries. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2255.5s)]
*  We don't need to negotiate agreements with the French and British of nuclear weapons. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2259.5s)]
*  We can do it with the Chinese and the Russians. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2263.5s)]
*  So I hope that if Kamala Harris wins and Biden has begun to, you know, they begin to link A.I. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2265.5s)]
*  too, because like you don't want the A.I. in charge of the nuclear weapons. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2270.5s)]
*  So what if the robots decide to kill us all? [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2273.5s)]
*  So like I think the next president, hopefully Kamala Harris, this is an area that, you know, sneaky could be a major push or I would encourage it to be. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2275.5s)]
*  Yeah, I hope so. And also a lot of flags that we screwed up by not saying speaking of Russian rockets to get us from Pabre. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2285.5s)]
*  Well, that's right. And we have Russian. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2292.5s)]
*  Yeah, like someone who is really good. That's really good. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2295.5s)]
*  That's a plus. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2297.5s)]
*  A plus. Speaking of less A plus topics on Monday, the World Health Organization's plan. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2298.5s)]
*  These transitions are so good. We have to keep everyone in. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2305.5s)]
*  Some of my worst ever. So on Monday, the WHO, they launched a plan to address M.P.O.C.S., [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2308.5s)]
*  which they declared a public health emergency of international concern a couple of weeks ago. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2314.5s)]
*  The outbreak is centered around the Democratic Republic of Congo, where there have been 23000 total cases of the disease. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2318.5s)]
*  That's up from 19000 total last week. M.P.O.C.S. is beginning to pop up in other countries in Africa. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2325.5s)]
*  It's been seen in Thailand, Pakistan, Sweden, a bunch of other places. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2330.5s)]
*  So this variant is that's now spreading is different than the 2022 outbreak outbreak where there was 100000 cases worldwide. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2333.5s)]
*  That outbreak primarily affected men through sexual contact. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2341.5s)]
*  While the current outbreak in the DRC is hitting children really hard, the majority of the cases are children, which is just awful. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2345.5s)]
*  You're listening to NPR yesterday and there was a woman whose all five of her kids got it. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2351.5s)]
*  You know, two hadn't recovered yet. So just devastating. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2356.5s)]
*  It has also been very difficult to get vaccines to where they needed. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2360.5s)]
*  Some people have criticized the WHO's response is slow, hobbled by red tape. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2364.5s)]
*  Germany is donating 100000 vaccines from its stock. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2369.5s)]
*  But that is a drop in the bucket when the the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have estimated that 10 million doses are needed. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2373.5s)]
*  To stop the current outbreak. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2380.5s)]
*  How do you say it? Rimoin. Rimoin. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2383.5s)]
*  We spoke to Anne Rimoin, an epidemiologist at UCLA, who's been studying M.P.O.C.S. for more than two decades to get some more context. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2386.5s)]
*  This M.P.O.C.S. outbreak has been ongoing in DRC for decades. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2393.5s)]
*  And in the last several years, it's really accelerated. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2399.5s)]
*  And there have been a lot of questions. Why? [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2403.5s)]
*  The idea that this is the WHO's sole responsibility to be able to take this in hand and to be able to do something, I think, is is a little bit misguided. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2405.5s)]
*  I mean, WHO provides advice and provides some leadership. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2414.5s)]
*  But WHO is responsible for funding response activities. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2419.5s)]
*  WHO is not responsible for being able to fund vaccines. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2422.5s)]
*  There's shared responsibility in all of this. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2428.5s)]
*  And it's complicated to be able to get the appropriate response and to be able to get the vaccines that are needed, get them through regulatory approvals in DRC, and then start to think about what happens next. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2431.5s)]
*  And those vaccines have to actually get to the people that need it. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2448.5s)]
*  So, Ben, I'm far from an expert on this. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2451.5s)]
*  I mean, it did remind me of the conversations we're having in 2021 when they were rolling out the COVID vaccines about vaccine equity and the fact that the continent of Africa just got completely screwed over. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2475.5s)]
*  That is clearly happening again here because when there's an M.P.O.C.S. outbreak in the U.S., vaccines pour into New York or other major cities, and it's not happening in the DRC, obviously the distribution is a lot harder in a place like the DRC, given the size and the lack of infrastructure. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2487.5s)]
*  But, you know, the people across Africa are furious, especially doctors and epidemiologists. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2502.5s)]
*  Yeah, it reminds me also a bit of Ebola in the sense that that started in West Africa. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2509.5s)]
*  And part of what is missing is like an evolved public health supply chains and capacity to surge resources. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2517.5s)]
*  In that case, it was less, you know, vaccines and more public health workers, public health infrastructure like hygiene, and the U.S. military basically ended up building some of that infrastructure. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2526.5s)]
*  And that gets to the point that she made that's so smart, which is sometimes when these outbreaks happen, you know, the default response is, oh, the pencil necks and paper pushers down at the WHO. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2538.5s)]
*  They're not moving fast enough, you know. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2548.5s)]
*  And yes, there is a lot of red tape. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2550.5s)]
*  But the reality is, again, the WHO is not like building, you know, logistics hubs and flying in vaccines. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2552.5s)]
*  They're just like making reports and warning people of things. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2559.5s)]
*  And then ultimately, there's no solution to these kinds of problems that don't involve a dramatic increase in capacity closer to where these outbreaks are happening, even in places like the DRC that don't have much of a health care infrastructure. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2562.5s)]
*  And it shows the importance of trying to help them build the health care infrastructure, not just when there's like a crisis like this, but, you know, consistently. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2574.5s)]
*  And the only other thing that I take away from this, hopefully that people get their arms around this and they surge more resources at it. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2582.5s)]
*  But are you feeling good, Tommy, about like the next pandemic? [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2588.5s)]
*  Because if we've got like anti-vax movements all over the world and people hate the WHO and they think, you know, there's lab leak people and people that, you know, like, we feel worse off. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2592.5s)]
*  We have the worst. We are less prepared. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2603.5s)]
*  You'd like to think you learned the lessons from last, you know, pandemic, so you're ready for the next one. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2606.5s)]
*  I worry that actually it's the opposite. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2610.5s)]
*  I feel the same way. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2612.5s)]
*  It's like on the one hand, I'm really glad we all know what mRNA vaccines are and we can make them. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2613.5s)]
*  But on the other hand, it's like the politics have shifted against it. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2618.5s)]
*  The anti-vaxxers are ascendant. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2621.5s)]
*  None of these countries seem to have invested in infrastructure. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2623.5s)]
*  It's bad. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2626.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's bad. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2627.5s)]
*  Well, then one of the reasons we are less prepared for the next pandemic is Donald Trump. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2628.5s)]
*  So let's talk about him for a minute. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2633.5s)]
*  So Donald Trump gave a speech on Monday. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2635.5s)]
*  There was a National Guard convention in Detroit, Michigan. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2639.5s)]
*  He gave this long speech. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2641.5s)]
*  It was like half prompt or half riffing as he likes to do a couple of policy things that he tried to roll out or that he mentioned that jumped out at me, assuming they were intentional. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2642.5s)]
*  Trump is now calling on NATO countries to spend at least 3% of GDP on defense, which is an increase from the 2% target. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2652.5s)]
*  So that is the thing. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2660.5s)]
*  He also floated creating a National Guard for the Space Force, which I just [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2662.5s)]
*  I admit to not having seen that. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2667.5s)]
*  Just hearing you say that out loud. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2671.5s)]
*  A bunch of weekend astronauts. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2673.5s)]
*  Is it like Elon Musk? [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2675.5s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2677.5s)]
*  I just thought it was really funny too. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2678.5s)]
*  I laughed out loud. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2679.5s)]
*  But mostly the chance was mostly the speech was a chance to attack Biden over the Afghanistan withdrawal around the three year anniversary in an effort to sell himself as the guy that will keep America out of the way. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2680.5s)]
*  America out of wars, including in the intro from Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat who left the Democratic Party and is now endorsing Trump. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2691.5s)]
*  Let's take a listen to a selection of Trump's speech. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2699.5s)]
*  Before I even arrive at the Oval Office shortly after I win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2703.5s)]
*  I'll get it settled very fast. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2711.5s)]
*  I don't want you guys going over there. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2714.5s)]
*  I don't want you going over there. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2717.5s)]
*  And I'm the only candidate in this race who can make this promise. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2720.5s)]
*  I will prevent. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2724.5s)]
*  This is for the spouses. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2727.5s)]
*  I will prevent World War Three. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2729.5s)]
*  Nobody else is going to prevent it. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2731.5s)]
*  You're going to end up in World War Three. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2733.5s)]
*  Look at what's going on right now with Ukraine discerning into Russia. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2735.5s)]
*  OK, you can end up in World War Three. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2742.5s)]
*  And it's going to be a bad one as opposed to the good one. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2745.5s)]
*  There's good World War Three. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2749.5s)]
*  So, look, I don't know. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2751.5s)]
*  It's a very blunt, simple message. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2753.5s)]
*  But I wonder, I mean, given that people turn on the TV and they see Gaza being scary and wars raging in Ukraine and then, you know, you see the same polling and focus groups I do where, you know, when you ask people like, should we be sending money to Ukraine for weapons or investing in schools? [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2755.5s)]
*  Like the answer is unanimous in one direction. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2773.5s)]
*  So I worry about this message a bit if he sticks to it. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2777.5s)]
*  Yeah, no, I think that people have to realize that he's hitting a nerve that has pretty broad support in the United States. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2781.5s)]
*  And look, even, you know, we're talking like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard are kind of these kooks. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2788.5s)]
*  You know, he like what decapitated a whale now and put it on the car and she's a conspiracy theorist. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2797.5s)]
*  But from the outside, you know, he's a Kennedy. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2803.5s)]
*  She's a former congresswoman. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2807.5s)]
*  Like these are well, you know, some, you know, he has very high name ID, Kennedy does. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2809.5s)]
*  I would take seriously the idea that like he's got this coalition that includes, you know, people that don't like foreign wars, don't like foreign entanglements, don't like foreign assistance, don't like trade agreements, don't like globalization. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2814.5s)]
*  That crosses both parties. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2827.5s)]
*  And and so you have to kind of take this seriously and, you know, counter actually that Trump is actually more likely to get us into wars because he's erratic, because he's unstable, because our alliances help keep us out of wars. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2831.5s)]
*  You know, like we have to be defending things like NATO on the basis that they help prevent war and rather than just kind of making them seem like it's warlike. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2845.5s)]
*  And we want to be in Ukraine forever, like, you know, pouring weapons in there, which is the trap that Democrats and even, you know, a lot of Republicans that don't like Trump fall into. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2855.5s)]
*  So that's the thing I'd say is like he sounds like ridiculous, but there's a potency to his message. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2864.5s)]
*  And I think bipartisan support out there for it. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2870.5s)]
*  And so the framing, you know, around how Kamala and Democrats present their support for alliances and kind of certain aspects of the global order has to be about this is actually a better way to keep us out of wars in a better way to minimize like what has been an overreach in our foreign policy. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2873.5s)]
*  Yeah. The other thing in the news recently that is concerning is just more stories about Trump's staff, former staff and maybe future staff. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2894.5s)]
*  There's two pieces worth highlighting. So one was an Atlantic story about this creep named Cash Patel. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2902.5s)]
*  We've talked about him on the show before. He served in a few roles in the Trump administration. He was on the NSC as a counterterrorism director or something. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2909.5s)]
*  Then he kind of ass kissed and failed his way up to becoming acting chief of staff at the Pentagon. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2917.5s)]
*  A few things that are worth knowing about this guy. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2923.5s)]
*  After being deputy to Rick Grinnell at DNI. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2925.5s)]
*  At DNI, yes. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2927.5s)]
*  Director of National Intelligence. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2928.5s)]
*  So Cash Patel is now, I think, trying to set himself up to become CIA director or the DNI. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2930.5s)]
*  He's doing that by selling lots of merch with his branding on it, including scarves, golf polos and wine. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2936.5s)]
*  You can buy Cash Patel branded wine for $239 for six bottles. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2944.5s)]
*  He wrote a children's book about Trump called The Plot Against the King. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2948.5s)]
*  It tells the story of a wizard named Cash who set out to save King Donald from the sinister machinations of Hillary Quinton and a shifty knight. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2952.5s)]
*  That's Adam Schiff. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2960.5s)]
*  Wait, wait. You see what he did there? Yeah. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2961.5s)]
*  You saw what he did there. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2963.5s)]
*  So some Trump advisors quoted in the piece say that Cash Patel now claims that he gave the order to take out Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the ISIS chief in 2019. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2964.5s)]
*  Though he apparently wasn't even in the room. And then this is actually really concerning, Ben. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2974.5s)]
*  So the Atlantic recounts a story from October 30th, 2020. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2977.5s)]
*  So it's right before the election. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2981.5s)]
*  SEAL Team Six is waiting for authorization to conduct a rescue operation to save an American who had been kidnapped in Western Africa. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2982.5s)]
*  The last holdup before they launched this operation is getting the permission to fly in Nigerian airspace. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2990.5s)]
*  That job goes to the State Department. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2997.5s)]
*  According to this story, Cash Patel calls the Pentagon. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=2999.5s)]
*  He says, I got approval from then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo launched the operation. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3003.5s)]
*  So these Navy SEALs are in the air. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3008.5s)]
*  They're like waiting to land when they figure out actually we did not get authorization to go into Nigerian airspace. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3010.5s)]
*  So they have to circle, circle, circle till someone else finally fixes the problem. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3016.5s)]
*  But basically what happens is Cash Patel just made up that he got authorization to do this from Mike Pompeo and almost sent a bunch of Navy SEALs [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3020.5s)]
*  into Nigerian airspace without permission where they could have been shot down by like Nigerian air defenses or viewed as hostile. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3028.5s)]
*  So like it's just an insane thing to do. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3036.5s)]
*  Biggest country in Africa. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3038.5s)]
*  Real military probably like has American air defense systems that could have shot at them. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3040.5s)]
*  So again, everyone thinks this guy could be the CIA director or the DNI. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3045.5s)]
*  It's like just a great window into the very scary, the worst of the worst, like scary hacks who would serve in this guy's foreign policy team. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3051.5s)]
*  Yeah, he's a total nutcase. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3060.5s)]
*  I mean, this isn't the case of someone with like a different ideological point of view. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3062.5s)]
*  This is someone who's just totally pill. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3066.5s)]
*  You know, I mean, I crossed paths with him when he was Devin Nunes's like hatchet man on the House Intelligence Committee investigating, you know, Russia interference. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3069.5s)]
*  But from the Trump perspective, you know, so he kind of like he was just conspiracy theory after conspiracy theory. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3079.5s)]
*  That's all he was doing. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3085.5s)]
*  And to be clear, Project 2025, the Trump administration to point out it will just be Casper tells, you know, like that's those are the people that will staff the government. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3086.5s)]
*  They are totally ideological. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3096.5s)]
*  This is a guy that like reveres Donald Trump more than any idea will do whatever the thing is he wants will be totally unaccountable to protocols, [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3099.5s)]
*  to guardrails, to constraints, to reality itself, like whether or not the Nigerians had given that approval. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3108.5s)]
*  And just because he's buffoonish, you know, and writes children's books about King Cash helping the wizard Donald doesn't mean it's not just dangerous as hell that that's the case. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3114.5s)]
*  And by the way, like he'd never be confirmed for those jobs, I think, even if there was a Republican Senate. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3125.5s)]
*  But it doesn't matter because I don't think Trump people give a shit. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3131.5s)]
*  These acting people, they'll just keep acting, you know, that could be acting head of the CIA for years and make life so miserable. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3133.5s)]
*  And this is what Project 2025 kind of wingset. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3141.5s)]
*  If you get the idiotic logs on on top, they'll just make life so fucking miserable for the workforce that they'll leave and they'll be replaced by other cash fatals. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3143.5s)]
*  Yeah. The other weird kind of former Trump staffer news was from a guy named H.R. McMaster listeners. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3152.5s)]
*  Listeners might remember him. He's a decorated military leader who was very well respected, a lieutenant general who became Trump's national security adviser from 2017 through 2018. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3158.5s)]
*  He has a new book out where he like celebrates some Trump policy, takes some shots at him and familiar territory. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3169.5s)]
*  But Ben, in talking to you before we did this, I didn't realize this was the second book, the second memoir about his time in the Trump administration. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3175.5s)]
*  I reviewed this. So he wrote a book called Battlegrounds, the fight to defend the free world. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3184.5s)]
*  OK. Not like this guy has any grandiose sense of his own. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3191.5s)]
*  And I actually wrote a review for The Washington Post about that book. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3197.5s)]
*  Now that when I look at the headline, and which, by the way, covers his time in the Trump administration, it's all about like how they finally got tough on China. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3203.5s)]
*  They finally saw the threat from Iran, takes all these shots at Obama. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3209.5s)]
*  I remember the title of my review is McMaster's memoir is heavy on history, but light on Trump. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3213.5s)]
*  Well, now we know why, because you needed to monetize the service twice. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3219.5s)]
*  Right. And he's waited four years and done another memoir, I guess, to share some things with us. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3224.5s)]
*  You know, it just shows you how absurd all these like if H.R. McMaster was that look, I'm glad this is happening. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3229.5s)]
*  I hope they all come out. I hope John, all the older white guys, John Kelly, you know, Rex Tillerson share all your best Trump stories and Doris Kamala Harris. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3235.5s)]
*  Please do it. But there's something pretty absurd about this guy. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3242.5s)]
*  If he was that concerned about Trump, you could have resigned at the time. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3246.5s)]
*  You could have told people at the time. You could have told people in 2020 before the election. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3250.5s)]
*  Instead, this stuff kind of dribbles out and background quotes to like Jeff Goldberg and then, you know, in The Atlantic. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3254.5s)]
*  And then you write one book and you kind of turn the dial a little bit and then you see like I need to get some attention. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3260.5s)]
*  So this time I'm going to take a whack at Trump and I'll get me booked on all the Sunday shows. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3265.5s)]
*  And there's something grotesque about like some of these Trump people. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3269.5s)]
*  Like I have more respect for the ones that just gone all in. Right. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3273.5s)]
*  You know, like Olivia Troy, like she's just owning it. Right. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3276.5s)]
*  There's this kind of incrementalism that I find really frustrating with these guys. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3279.5s)]
*  Two books about the same period. I've never heard of it. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3282.5s)]
*  You just write another memoir. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3287.5s)]
*  Well, at least I got some shit from some. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3289.5s)]
*  My second book is it's not a memoir. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3291.5s)]
*  It's about the rise of authoritarianism, but it has like some first person's read. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3293.5s)]
*  So a couple of friends of mine are like, oh, look at you. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3296.5s)]
*  You had to. Well, I was like, at least I picked up the thread in 2017. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3298.5s)]
*  Cover the same ground. Yeah, come on. That's crazy. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3302.5s)]
*  OK, two more things before we get to the interview. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3305.5s)]
*  So first of all, there have been some major protests happening in India since a female doctor was brutally raped and murdered [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3307.5s)]
*  while she was laying down to rest during a night shift in a hospital in India on August 9th in Calcutta. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3315.5s)]
*  On Tuesday, thousands of student protesters marched in the streets and police responded by using water cannons and tear gas against them. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3321.5s)]
*  The country's Supreme Court had to step in in this case because law enforcement has been criticized for the slow response and for allegedly covering up what happened. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3328.5s)]
*  The court also ordered a task force to be set up to create recommendations for safety protocols in workplaces. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3336.5s)]
*  These recent protests are a response to this specific horrific crime, but they are also about the broader prevalence of gender based violence in India. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3342.5s)]
*  We spoke with Rana Ayub, a great friend of the show, an Indian journalist and opinion columnist at The Washington Post. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3352.5s)]
*  To get some more context, here's a clip from that conversation. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3358.5s)]
*  But what happens in India is that we have this flash in the pan moment where one rape happens and everybody's like, OK, we have to protest. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3361.5s)]
*  And then suddenly every rape story is covered. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3369.5s)]
*  But what we do not realize is there is a rape in this country every 18 minutes. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3372.5s)]
*  Every 18 minutes, one rape happens. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3377.5s)]
*  Right. As we talk as this doctor was raped for the next four days, there were reports of two children in Bombay being sexually assaulted. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3380.5s)]
*  There was a story of a 14 year old lower caste girl being raped in a state in the northern state of India. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3388.5s)]
*  There was a story of a young woman going to report a rape, but the cops refused to report to accept the case and she died by suicide. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3394.5s)]
*  I mean, I mean, and when somebody says India is a rape capital, people are not talking about it. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3402.5s)]
*  We take offense saying, but you are attacking the credibility of this country. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3407.5s)]
*  You're attacking the sovereignty of India, not realizing that patriarchy, the inherent patriarchy in our popular culture, the inherent patriarchy in our films, in our dramas, in our policing, in our political landscape. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3410.5s)]
*  Women are not stakeholders. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3423.5s)]
*  So when something like this happens, political parties start playing this blame game. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3425.5s)]
*  The Congress, the opposition party will blame the BJP, the BJP will blame the Congress, and that's it. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3430.5s)]
*  But nobody will talk about how do we end this systemic violence against women that women again in this country do not feel safe to step outside. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3436.5s)]
*  We are not safe. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3445.5s)]
*  Ron also pointed out in our conversation that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi actually promised major reforms back in 2012 and wrote a wave of anger about violence towards women after this, that horrific infamous gang rape in 2012 when he was elected. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3446.5s)]
*  But statistically, things have only gotten worse since then, despite the government ushering in tougher sentences. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3463.5s)]
*  According to the National Crime Records Bureau in India, there are more than 30,000 rape cases per year. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3468.5s)]
*  Ben, the question I had is, do you think that this is the kind of thing that has been or should be raised by US officials in meetings? [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3474.5s)]
*  Or could be Joe Biden to Modi, but also Tony Blinken or others or specialists in the State Department just kind of generally pressuring elected officials to hold people more accountable because it's clear that they're not taking seriously the pressure they feel internally at least yet. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3484.5s)]
*  I think the thing, you know, I'm not sure that the bilateral kind of pressure makes the difference on this as much as part of what the US government can do at its best is, you know, we have an office, an ambassador focused on gender equality, State Department do a lot around the world on these issues. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3502.5s)]
*  Part of what you want to do is globalize this conversation. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3519.5s)]
*  What can everybody be doing to strengthen safeguards against rape and sexual assault and against gender-based violence and kind of bring India into conversations on a multilateral basis about like, how do you toughen laws? [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3522.5s)]
*  How do you like change culture? [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3539.5s)]
*  How do you allow for better reporting? [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3541.5s)]
*  All the kinds of things that might address this. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3544.5s)]
*  But I do think it's worth Americans speaking to this in the relationship with India. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3546.5s)]
*  But within India itself, part of what you have to get at, and I don't claim to be the expert on this, and Rana captured it far better than I could, but some of this is just deeply embedded cultural norms that need to evolve like they do everywhere. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3552.5s)]
*  But some of this is also like you unleash a certain brand of pretty male dominated Hindu nationalism, you know, and it does kind of like create cultures of impunity around powerful people or the justice system is more focused on Muslims and Hindus. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3568.5s)]
*  And once you just start to kind of create that kind of dynamic, it can manifest itself. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3590.5s)]
*  Look, it's what we see here, right? [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3595.5s)]
*  Like Trump is a MAGA, guess who suffers under that a lot? [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3597.5s)]
*  Women, you know, because there's a kind of patriarchal attitude that leads to Dobbs' decision, that leads to something IVF is being targeted. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3600.5s)]
*  It's the same thing there, right? [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3608.5s)]
*  Like this kind of right-wing nationalism creates the wrong environment to fix the problem. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3610.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3615.5s)]
*  Well, again, thank you to Rana for talking to us for this. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3616.5s)]
*  Everyone should follow her work. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3618.5s)]
*  She's one of the best journalists out there covering Modi and all things happening in India. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3620.5s)]
*  Finally, Ben, World War II, finally, Ben, World War II can feel like ancient history these days. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3625.5s)]
*  But in reality, it wasn't that long ago, right? [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3632.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3635.5s)]
*  Forties. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3636.5s)]
*  Which is probably why some people in London were a little weirded out the other day when a German warship was spotted cruising down the River Thames while blasting the Imperial March from the East. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3637.5s)]
*  The Imperial March from Star Wars. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3647.5s)]
*  Yes, Darth Vader song. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3649.5s)]
*  Let's take a listen. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3651.5s)]
*  I believe this was just a person, a person who spotted this like German destroyer rolling into their city playing that song. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3665.5s)]
*  So the ship was in the area for training at stops in London for a routine supply stop. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3674.5s)]
*  After this video went viral, the German Navy released a statement on the music choice saying, quote, The commander can choose the music freely. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3679.5s)]
*  The choice of music has no deeper message. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3686.5s)]
*  Really? [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3690.5s)]
*  Are you sure? [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3691.5s)]
*  Do we buy that? [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3692.5s)]
*  So I actually watched not anticipation of the segment. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3693.5s)]
*  Last night, I watched Return of the Jedi with my daughter. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3696.5s)]
*  Nice. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3699.5s)]
*  How does she like it? [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3700.5s)]
*  She loves it. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3701.5s)]
*  I have now done the first, you know, first three, which I guess are four through seven. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3702.5s)]
*  She liked the Ewoks in particular. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3706.5s)]
*  People remember that. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3708.5s)]
*  I do not. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3709.5s)]
*  But you are village. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3710.5s)]
*  You have that toy in that thing where you can. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3712.5s)]
*  Yes, I had all that. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3714.5s)]
*  I was explaining last night. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3715.5s)]
*  I had the the the robots with like the tall legs and you could shoot, you know, the what are they called? [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3716.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3720.5s)]
*  Well, it's going to hate us for not knowing. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3721.5s)]
*  We'll come. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3723.5s)]
*  I know we better on the power of array. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3724.5s)]
*  But what I will say is all the you forget that all the kind of white dudes that are like running the Death Star in Return of the Jedi and they're just they're Nazis. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3727.5s)]
*  Like they're clearly modeled on Nazis. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3737.5s)]
*  Like they look like Nazis. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3739.5s)]
*  They're wearing kind of Nazi adjacent uniforms. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3740.5s)]
*  The whole goose stepping empire thing. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3743.5s)]
*  Like clearly the empire was so I don't know. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3746.5s)]
*  Not reading the different meaning. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3750.5s)]
*  Like it just feels like a little too close to read that deep pal. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3752.5s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3755.5s)]
*  You talk about these things. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3756.5s)]
*  The AT walker. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3757.5s)]
*  Yeah, the AT walker. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3760.5s)]
*  Armored transport. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3761.5s)]
*  Yeah, those things are bad. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3762.5s)]
*  And the EWOCKS get control one of those and quickly wipe out the empire. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3763.5s)]
*  You know, yeah, those things are just smoking EWOCKS left and right. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3766.5s)]
*  And then you walk to like something like string around their legs. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3769.5s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3771.5s)]
*  That's pretty. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3772.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3773.5s)]
*  And you just like some slingshots. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3774.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3775.5s)]
*  But that's you know, if I was a German, I actually would. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3776.5s)]
*  You know, there's some different soundtrack you could test out next time. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3777.5s)]
*  German's not always known for the sense of humor. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3781.5s)]
*  That commander was having a good laugh as he cruised into London. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3783.5s)]
*  Okay, that's the end of the news section for this very slap happy show. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3788.5s)]
*  We're going to take a quick break. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3792.5s)]
*  When we come back, we'll hear my interview with Senator Peter Welch from Vermont. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3793.5s)]
*  We talk about Gaza. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3797.5s)]
*  We talk about Ukraine. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3798.5s)]
*  We talk about Kamala Harris's campaign. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3799.5s)]
*  Lots of good stuff. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3801.5s)]
*  Oh, we also talk about seeing Tim Walz, the vice presidential nominee in the gym. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3802.5s)]
*  And what that was like. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3808.5s)]
*  So stick around for that. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3809.5s)]
*  Real quick before we go to break, we are just very, very excited to announce that the trailer for Crooked's newest limited series, Empire City, is here and available for you to listen to. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3810.5s)]
*  It's from Wondery Crooked Media and Push Black. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3820.5s)]
*  Empire City is the untold origin story of the NYPD. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3823.5s)]
*  It uncovers the hidden history of one of the largest police forces in the world. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3826.5s)]
*  It is from Peabody award winning host, Chenjirai Kamenica. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3830.5s)]
*  He is an incredible host. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3833.5s)]
*  You might have listened to some of his past shows like Uncivil. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3836.5s)]
*  And he takes you on this amazing journey through pivotal moments in New York's past that formed the foundation for today's policing from its origins rooted in slavery to rival police gangs battling across the city from the everyday people who try to resist this organization every step along the way. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3839.5s)]
*  You should check out Empire City. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3858.5s)]
*  It's an amazing show. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3860.5s)]

*  Also, Ben, we set this big goal at the DNC. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3871.5s)]
*  We're trying to sort of harness the enthusiasm, get people pumped up, get people to turn out and volunteer for election day. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3873.5s)]
*  My dad volunteered. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3879.5s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3881.5s)]
*  Please tell your dad. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3882.5s)]
*  My dad like his crush. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3883.5s)]
*  God bless that man. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3884.5s)]
*  So we set a goal of 75,000 volunteers by September 17th. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3885.5s)]
*  We are getting there, but we're not there yet. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3890.5s)]

*  It's great to be here. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3929.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3930.5s)]
*  We were just chatting about all things Woodstock, Vermont, because my mom spends a lot of time up there. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3931.5s)]
*  I will not make the listeners hear all about Shackleton Thomas and all the other great stores in the region. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3936.5s)]
*  But if you have a chance to go to Vermont, go in the winter, you can ski, go in the summer. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3941.5s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3945.5s)]
*  I mean, really go any time. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3946.5s)]
*  It's a great state. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3947.5s)]
*  Well, that's right. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3948.5s)]
*  So come on up. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3949.5s)]
*  We'll give you a little nice Vermont welcome. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3950.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3952.5s)]
*  Me and Bernie, you'll give you some maple syrup. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3953.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3954.5s)]
*  Nice Vermont welcome, which means getting beeped at if you have a New York or Massachusetts license plate sometimes in my experience. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3955.5s)]
*  But I digress. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3961.5s)]
*  Senator, I just want to start by saying I have appreciated for nearly a year now your leadership in the Senate when it comes to trying to end the war in Gaza. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3962.5s)]
*  You've been calling for a ceasefire since I think November of last year. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3972.5s)]
*  You were one of just a handful of senators who actually voted against sending additional military aid to Israel as part of this broader package. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3977.5s)]
*  But you and Bernie spoke out very strongly against your concerns. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3986.5s)]
*  Unfortunately, despite your efforts, 10 months into this war, it's still raging on. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3991.5s)]
*  And the Biden administration's approach still seems to be send Bibi Netanyahu and the Israeli military what they ask for. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=3997.5s)]
*  And then I guess hope on the side we can cut a ceasefire deal. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4005.5s)]
*  Have you been able to talk directly with President Biden or his team about maybe changing this approach or trying to force Netanyahu to change course by withholding arms or other diplomatic pressure? [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4009.5s)]
*  No, I haven't talked to him personally. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4021.5s)]
*  But, you know, the bottom line here is that all of the fears that we had with the Netanyahu approach to this horrible event of October 7th came true. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4024.5s)]
*  And it's basically scorched earth, massive bombing, 2000 pound bombs on apartment buildings where you're thinking maybe there's a Hamas person on the second floor and you blow up the entire building. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4036.5s)]
*  And, you know, Gaza, the suffering there is immense in the search for the hostages continues. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4048.5s)]
*  Good news today, one hostage has been returned alive and well. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4055.5s)]
*  But, you know, what I think the basic question for us, the U.S., is whether we're going to use our leverage. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4060.5s)]
*  I mean, what I find so difficult is that the policies we annunciate, which is a two state solution, which is in opposition to war settlements in the West Bank, [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4069.5s)]
*  which is in service of the dignity of Palestinians and the security of Israel, we assert these as policies, but then essentially bend to whatever it is Netanyahu decides to do. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4082.5s)]
*  And the challenge we have, and I actually think it's a real challenge that Israel has, is they've got a very extreme right wing government that, in fact, people like Ben Gilear and Smotrich want a one state solution, which is to say driving Palestinians out. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4097.5s)]
*  And you're seeing that with their aggressive efforts in the West Bank and you're seeing it with their overall policies. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4116.5s)]
*  So at a certain point, the administration or hopefully the Harris administration is going to have to use the leverage we have to stand up to Netanyahu rather than allow him to continue to disregard our aspirations. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4122.5s)]
*  So that's, I think, the question down the road that hopefully the Harris administration is going to face and I hope will use the leverage that it has. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4138.5s)]
*  Yeah, I want to ask you about the Harris administration and what she should do, but one more question on Congress. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4147.5s)]
*  I mean, I was struck by the fact that back in March, you had this amazing speech from Senator Schumer where he was basically calling on Netanyahu to step down, calling him illegitimate. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4152.5s)]
*  And then a few months later, he joined with Republicans to extend an invitation to Netanyahu to address a joint session of Congress. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4161.5s)]
*  And I was wondering how you understand that seeming contradiction, if that was politics or I don't know. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4169.5s)]
*  Well, I think Senator Schumer got jammed a bit by the speaker, you know, and this has gotten very partisan. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4176.5s)]
*  So when we're talking about what happened with the invitation, it has very little do with our policy towards Israel. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4180.5s)]
*  But the speaker, Mike Johnson, is using the Israeli issue to try to stick it to Democrats and present this as a partisan issue. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4186.5s)]
*  In fact, the overall question is how do we assure Israel's right to be a Democratic Jewish state when the policies that are being pursued by Netanyahu are extremely violent and over the top and where the settlement expansion is doing more and more to undercut any kind of credibility for Israel in their position. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4197.5s)]
*  And what's happened here is that Israel's standing in the world has really been diminished. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4225.5s)]
*  And that's a threat to its own security, not to mention that you've got an enormous risk of escalation. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4230.5s)]
*  So, you know, my preference would be that Senator Schumer didn't extend the invitation, but I get it. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4236.5s)]
*  And in fact, you saw a number of people, myself included, Bernie included, that didn't go to the speech, not because we didn't want to hear from an Israeli leader. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4243.5s)]
*  But we saw how essentially Netanyahu just stokes the partisan flames in his very insulting to the Moroccan people, in my view. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4254.5s)]
*  You mentioned your hopes for Vice President Harris's campaign. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4265.5s)]
*  I mean, I assume that for the next few months, President Biden is going to personally manage all things foreign policy until the last minutes of his presidency, especially the Netanyahu account, given how he's approached it to date. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4269.5s)]
*  So I think those listening and hoping that Kamala Harris now ascending to the top of the ticket can sort of change current policy are probably out of luck. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4282.5s)]
*  But I think you're right. I mean, I'd love to hear her signal or explain how things would be different if she's elected. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4291.5s)]
*  Do you have any recommendations for how she should do that? [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4297.5s)]
*  Well, it's what I'm talking about now. Well, first of all, in the Q&A, here's the reality, in my view. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4300.5s)]
*  We have to beat Trump. We have to beat Trump and keep him out of the White House. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4305.5s)]
*  Netanyahu is rooting for Trump. Putin is rooting for Trump. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4310.5s)]
*  And the other reality is that the American people, I do not believe, are going to decide this race on the basis of foreign policy. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4314.5s)]
*  It's going to be basis of economics. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4322.5s)]
*  You know, folks are freaked out about their kids not being able to afford a house no matter how hard they work. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4324.5s)]
*  In a two-part family, both of them have good jobs, houses still out of reach, childcare, family leave. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4331.5s)]
*  The cost of health care, even with Obamacare, is really escalating beyond reach, not just for individuals, but for employers who are trying to have employer-sponsored health care. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4340.5s)]
*  So I think this campaign is really going to be about Harris's ability to show that she cares about the middle class economic struggles. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4350.5s)]
*  And those are real. And the foreign policy questions that are incredibly important, like what's going on in Gaza, in Israel, I don't think will be determining factors in this race. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4359.5s)]
*  And you only have one president at a time. And of course, she's running as the vice president of the sitting president. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4371.5s)]
*  So the policy is going to be determined much more by, obviously, by the president. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4377.5s)]
*  I think what Harris did manage to do, you know, and it's understandable in the political context, is she signaled what has been traditional support for Israel, but not defining that Israel as Netanyahu. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4382.5s)]
*  But she gave a very significant acknowledgement of the unspeakable suffering that Palestinians are experiencing as a result of the Netanyahu policy. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4394.5s)]
*  So bottom line here, she's got to focus on what does it take to win. Economic issues, I think, have to be front and center. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4406.5s)]
*  And I hope she can signal that she's going to turn the page on just this, I think, excessive deference to Netanyahu. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4415.5s)]
*  My advice, Sarah, would be what my advice has been all along. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4423.5s)]
*  We are for a democratic, independent state of Israel, and we're for a democratic, independent state of Palestine. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4427.5s)]
*  But in order to get that, we have to use our leverage because the current Israeli government does not share those goals. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4435.5s)]
*  That's bottom line. So at a certain point, Netanyahu can't just disregard everything we are advocating and have us accommodate everything he's doing. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4443.5s)]
*  We've got to call the question. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4454.5s)]
*  There are a lot of delegates at the DNC, many of them from the uncommitted movement, which was, you know, voted people who voted uncommitted in the primary to signal anger at President Biden's Gaza policy. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4456.5s)]
*  They wanted a Palestinian speaker to be allowed to speak at the DNC. That didn't happen. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4469.5s)]
*  Do you think that was a mistake? [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4474.5s)]
*  Well, I would have supported a Palestinian speaker. I really would. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4475.5s)]
*  But let me be clear. I'm just horrified when it's happening. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4479.5s)]
*  It's 40,000 people. When we talked, you know, the last time, however many months ago, it was in the thousands. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4483.5s)]
*  But now it's like 40,000 in Gaza has been destroyed. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4489.5s)]
*  And Netanyahu shows no signs of changing or adjusting his policy in any way. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4494.5s)]
*  So there's a very compelling reason then to allow those who are experiencing the suffering to speak out and express it. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4501.5s)]
*  So I'm very empathetic with that goal. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4509.5s)]
*  And I appreciate folks out on the street, which, by the way, I was up in the street in that very same convention in 1968 when the issue was the Vietnam War. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4512.5s)]
*  Wow. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4523.5s)]
*  That was in my past. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4524.5s)]
*  Were you running for the cops? Like, what was that like? [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4525.5s)]
*  Well, I was. I mean, I was I had dropped out of college then and I was working in the in the west side of Chicago doing civil rights work with a Martin Luther King Southern Christian Leadership affiliated organization. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4528.5s)]
*  It was really about housing discrimination. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4541.5s)]
*  But, you know, that was an incredible time in our country. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4543.5s)]
*  Bobby Kennedy had just been assassinated in June. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4547.5s)]
*  Martin Luther King had recently been assassinated. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4550.5s)]
*  The memory of JFK being assassinated and of course, the Vietnam War was such an extraordinarily divisive issue where my generation, I had friends I went to in high school that didn't go to college, didn't get a deferment. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4553.5s)]
*  And they went to Vietnam and some of them died and some of them came back with wicked injuries. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4567.5s)]
*  So it was just a furiously divided situation. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4572.5s)]
*  So in that protest, I was there. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4576.5s)]
*  I didn't get hit, fortunately, but I did. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4580.5s)]
*  I was in the in the in the path of the of the gas that they were and they were, you know, it was awful. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4582.5s)]
*  I mean, it was a police riot unleashed by Mayor Daley. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4589.5s)]
*  But here's where I think all of us have to really say what's going to happen in the next 70 days, plus a few. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4592.5s)]
*  And that is American people are going to decide who's the president. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4601.5s)]
*  And my focus will be what do we need to do to win as opposed to what do we need to do? [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4604.5s)]
*  Because it's a very important issue to us. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4611.5s)]
*  If that helps us to win, I'm for it. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4614.5s)]
*  If it compromises our ability to win, I'm not. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4616.5s)]
*  Because I think the difference between Trump and Harris is night and day. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4619.5s)]
*  It's night and day on on Israel and our prospects to influence her policy in her approach and give her support to stand up to Netanyahu. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4625.5s)]
*  But it's night and day on Ukraine and Putin in just the Democratic government. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4634.5s)]
*  So I do think that she's got to focus on on the economy because people have this weird, my view, memory of things being better during the Trump years, [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4641.5s)]
*  at least according to some polls they were, in my view. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4653.5s)]
*  And he doesn't have any plans to do anything that's at all constructive, more tax cuts for very wealthy people. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4656.5s)]
*  So I think Harris did an extremely good job getting us started. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4663.5s)]
*  And by the way, this is an interesting contrast between this convention in 68. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4668.5s)]
*  You know, I was in college then, dropped out, as I said. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4674.5s)]
*  But there was an enormous sense of despair among a lot of my classmates and my generation at how unresponsive the political system was. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4678.5s)]
*  I mean, Vietnam was outrageous. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4689.5s)]
*  That was the American policy to go to war and be killing these Vietnamese. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4692.5s)]
*  And the damage we did there in the suffering we inflicted on young people here in the cynicism was great. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4696.5s)]
*  It was unspeakable. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4704.5s)]
*  We couldn't get the politicians to pay any attention and listen. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4705.5s)]
*  Fast forward, we have this situation where President Biden had that bad debate, where a lot of folks thought, you know what, we really appreciate what you've done. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4709.5s)]
*  You've been a great president, but we don't think we can win if you're continuing as our candidate. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4718.5s)]
*  He responded. The political system responded. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4724.5s)]
*  So it actually gives me some hope. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4727.5s)]
*  There was responsiveness there. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4729.5s)]
*  And now, I was among those who really did think it was important for the president to step aside so that we had a shot at winning. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4732.5s)]
*  And it was extraordinary, the energy that was unleashed. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4742.5s)]
*  And of course, Kamala Harris was there to essentially mobilize that. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4746.5s)]
*  And now we've got to harness it so that every day is about doing what Tim Walsh was saying. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4752.5s)]
*  Make that phone call. Get that five dollar contribution. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4758.5s)]
*  Knock on that door. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4762.5s)]
*  So there is a responsiveness that I see in this election that was denied us in the 68 election. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4764.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's a really good point. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4771.5s)]
*  And, you know, I think you were the very first U.S. Senator to call on President Biden to step aside. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4773.5s)]
*  So thank you for that and stepping up when people needed to hear that message from senior members of the party, elected officials. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4778.5s)]
*  Last question on Gaza. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4785.5s)]
*  I do want to ask about Ukraine. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4786.5s)]
*  I mean, assuming I'm with you that Donald Trump would be a disaster for Gaza, Kamala Harris, I have no doubt, would be better, although she has some sort of gaps. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4787.5s)]
*  And we don't necessarily know what her plan. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4796.5s)]
*  We don't know. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4798.5s)]
*  Understandably, in some ways. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4799.5s)]
*  Peter Beinart wrote a piece in The New York Times where he argued that if elected president, vice president Harris should take a very Vermont approach to Gaza by saying she will enforce current law, the Leahy law, [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4801.5s)]
*  named after former Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy, which basically prohibits the U.S. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4814.5s)]
*  from assisting units of a military or security force that commits gross violations of human rights. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4819.5s)]
*  The Leahy law has been used many times, but it's never been applied to Israel. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4826.5s)]
*  Do you think that would be an approach that makes sense? [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4830.5s)]
*  Well, I do. I think that's a really good place to start. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4832.5s)]
*  If we have a law, enforce the law. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4835.5s)]
*  And by the way, the Leahy law is an example. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4837.5s)]
*  Okay. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4840.5s)]
*  But the War Crimes Act is also an example. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4841.5s)]
*  There are standards that apply and the Department of Justice has jurisdiction over the war crimes. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4844.5s)]
*  And of course, State Department has jurisdiction over the Leahy law. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4849.5s)]
*  So when we talk about enforcing law, yes, the Leahy law, but also some of the war crimes law that is being enforced by justice towards Ukraine, towards Russia and Ukraine. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4853.5s)]
*  And we should be doing that where there are credible reports like the World Central Kitchen killing, [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4866.5s)]
*  likes other reports about Israeli units doing things that are not at all justified, even under the laws of war. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4875.5s)]
*  So Bynard's got, I think, a very good point. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4886.5s)]
*  And that's kind of what I'm talking about with a Harris administration that basically stands up for our principles. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4889.5s)]
*  And they're enunciated in those. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4899.5s)]
*  The Leahy law is a good example. Enforce it. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4901.5s)]
*  Then you're not, you know, it's just, you can't violate the Leahy law, period. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4904.5s)]
*  Enforce the War Crimes Act. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4909.5s)]
*  Enforce our long held position during Republicans and Democrats. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4911.5s)]
*  You can't have settlements in the West Bank. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4917.5s)]
*  And of course, the violence in the West Bank is escalating enormously. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4920.5s)]
*  And a lot of the right wing elements of the Nanyahu government are using as a cover the war in Gaza, [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4925.5s)]
*  essentially to start perpetrating violence in land seizures in the West Bank. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4931.5s)]
*  So I think that would start sending a signal that the US is serious about what we say we're serious about. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4937.5s)]
*  And we're not just going to capitulate constantly to whatever Nanyahu does. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4943.5s)]
*  We can't trust the guy. I mean, so at a certain point, you've got to call the question. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4948.5s)]
*  Agreed with that. Switching gears to Ukraine. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4952.5s)]
*  Ukrainian officials have been and remain incredibly frustrated by restrictions put in place by the Biden administration [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4955.5s)]
*  about how US military aid to Ukraine can be used. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4964.5s)]
*  Specifically, they want to be allowed to hit targets across the border in Russia. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4968.5s)]
*  The concern being that, you know, essentially the Russian military has a safe space from which to launch glide bombs [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4973.5s)]
*  and other munitions onto them and they can't respond and take those military units out. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4982.5s)]
*  Do you think that Biden's restrictions are appropriate? Is it time to change course? [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4988.5s)]
*  How are you viewing this these days? [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4995.5s)]
*  They should give more latitude to Ukraine to strike military targets in Russia, not civilian targets. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=4997.5s)]
*  OK, but where we have good intelligence that some of those glide bombs are being launched from location A, [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5004.5s)]
*  we should be the Ukrainians should be given the green light to use what they have, [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5013.5s)]
*  including things we've given them to take out that offensive asset that is being used against their defenseless people. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5019.5s)]
*  So focus on the military targets. But yes, I think it's really important for us to give that latitude out to Ukraine. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5027.5s)]
*  What other question for you? Governor Tim Walz just got shot out of a presidential campaign cannon. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5035.5s)]
*  He was when he was selected to be Kamala Harris's vice presidential nominee. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5042.5s)]
*  Most Americans had not heard of him until a few weeks ago. You served with him in Congress. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5046.5s)]
*  Did you work with him much? Did you know him? What can you tell us about Tim Walz? [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5051.5s)]
*  Oh, you know what? He was my classmate. And when you go to Congress, the people you know the best and know the longest [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5055.5s)]
*  and experience share the most experiences with are your classmates. And he and I were elected in 06. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5062.5s)]
*  And we were on the Agriculture Committee together. So I worked a lot with him on that. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5069.5s)]
*  He was on the Veteran Affairs Committee and I wasn't, but I supported him when he first ran to be ranking member. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5073.5s)]
*  And I made a speech on his behalf in the Steering and Policy Committee and he didn't get it that time because he wasn't the most senior. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5080.5s)]
*  There was one person ahead of him, but he was clearly the best, the command sergeant major. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5088.5s)]
*  And everything you see about Walz, that's what we saw. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5093.5s)]
*  He was very, very popular and kind of just a light person. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5097.5s)]
*  He didn't take himself as a big deal, but he worked his heart out harder than anybody else. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5104.5s)]
*  And he's so unassuming. Not that people want to hear about the gym, but we were in the same row. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5110.5s)]
*  And he'd come in and he was determined to lose a few pounds and go out and run no matter what the weather. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5118.5s)]
*  But he went back to his National Guard days. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5124.5s)]
*  He wanted to get into his running stuff quick and get back into his suit clothes fast. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5128.5s)]
*  So he would just take his tie down halfway, unbutton the top couple of buttons of his shirt and then pull off his dress shirt like it was a t-shirt. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5135.5s)]
*  And he'd be out the door and running. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5145.5s)]
*  But I really, really think he's a breath of fresh air in politics. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5147.5s)]
*  And his lack of pretense, but his energy, his affection for his family and the people he serves, that's real. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5154.5s)]
*  The other thing, by the way, there's two things that Kamala Harris did that really have given me a lot of confidence. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5160.5s)]
*  That she's in charge of her campaign. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5166.5s)]
*  First, she picked Walls. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5169.5s)]
*  And you know that the pollsters and the consultants were probably saying, well, you've got to go with Shapiro because he's Pennsylvania. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5172.5s)]
*  All right. A lot of logic to that. He's a compelling guy. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5179.5s)]
*  But she clearly saw something in Walls that probably didn't show up on the polling and his ability to connect to everyday Americans. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5182.5s)]
*  And then the second thing that I thought was really terrific. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5193.5s)]
*  She described him as a middle class kid who grew up in Nebraska. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5196.5s)]
*  Very modest. And she is a middle class little girl who grew up in Oakland. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5200.5s)]
*  So it's an inclusive approach that sometimes the Democrats aren't good at. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5205.5s)]
*  And we've got to be focusing on everybody who is struggling to try to make ends meet and an economy that's really tough. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5210.5s)]
*  If you're trying to buy a home or even rent now, the rents have gone so way up. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5218.5s)]
*  So I think Tim is going to be a good partner in that effort. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5223.5s)]
*  And I think that's really where the campaign is going to be won. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5226.5s)]
*  I love that. Yeah. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5229.5s)]
*  I mean, I felt the same way. I felt energized and excited by him being named. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5231.5s)]
*  I actually had a chance to interview him in February and we spent five or ten minutes talking about football. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5234.5s)]
*  He was a defensive coordinator. So I pressed him on what defense he ran. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5239.5s)]
*  You ever bring him to Vermont and show him what a real cow looks like? [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5243.5s)]
*  Yes. No, I should do. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5246.5s)]
*  You know, he's a guy in demand right now. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5248.5s)]
*  I'm not sure we'll get him in a state where it's looking pretty good for the Harris Wall stick, but maybe afterwards. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5250.5s)]
*  Yeah. Well, listen, I think you should get him up there. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5256.5s)]
*  You know, you think it's called Minnesota, pal? [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5259.5s)]
*  Like, let's go up to Killington or something. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5261.5s)]
*  Senator, thank you so much for doing the show. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5264.5s)]
*  And thank you again for just being a leader on all things Gaza for a very long time, [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5266.5s)]
*  especially when it was when it was not as clear that that was the right path. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5270.5s)]
*  You were saying the right thing. So, yeah. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5274.5s)]
*  Well, thank you. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5275.5s)]
*  Thank you. No, and I appreciate your leadership on that story. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5276.5s)]
*  It's absolutely appalling. We should not be part of this. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5279.5s)]
*  Amen. Amen. Thank you. Bye bye. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5283.5s)]
*  Thanks again to Senator Welch for joining the show. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5285.5s)]
*  And thanks to you guys, the listeners. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5287.5s)]
*  Thanks to Pavel Bure for having a quick fucking set of risks, you know. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5290.5s)]
*  And that guy had, you know, a shot like nothing else. Yeah. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5294.5s)]
*  Very handsome, too. Good looking. Good looking hockey player. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5297.5s)]
*  I was more of a Jeremy Ronick guy. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5300.5s)]
*  I feel like between Oasis and Pavel Bure, like we were kind of dating ourselves a little too hard. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5301.5s)]
*  Kind of. Yeah. Big time. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5306.5s)]
*  All right. That's it. Talk to you soon. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNLIMdorWOk&t=5309.5s)]
