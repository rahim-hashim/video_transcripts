# Norway, Ireland & Spain Recognize Palestinian Statehood, Add International Pressure to End Gaza War
**Pod Save the World:** [May 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4)
*  Welcome back to Pots A the World. I'm Ben Rhodes and today we have a three-part show for you. That's right [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=0.0s)]
*  Triple the content first. I'll talk a little bit about the latest news out of Israel and Gaza [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  but then I will be speaking with Prime Minister Jonas Garstota the Prime Minister of Norway who took the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=10.48s)]
*  significant decision this past week to recognize a Palestinian state alongside [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=16.8s)]
*  Spain and Ireland. He'll talk a bit about what that decision means why he made it and how he sees the future [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=22.48s)]
*  of a potential Palestinian state. Then you will hear my conversation with Fried Zakaria, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=28.32s)]
*  journalist, author of the new book Age of Revolutions. Fried was my co-host to talk about [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=34.4s)]
*  a variety of different issues. We talk about the situation in Israel. We talk about [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=40.08s)]
*  Russia and Ukraine. We talk about Taiwan and China. So we kind of step back and take the lay of the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=44.72s)]
*  land on all these global hot spots that we've been talking about on the podcast. I want to note [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  Fried and I pre-taped our conversation on Friday, May 24th. So it doesn't reflect all of the things [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=55.28s)]
*  that have happened since then and things obviously move very quickly but actually the utility in [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=60.96s)]
*  talking to a guy like Fried is that ability to step back and he had a lot of smart things to say [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=65.2s)]
*  about the Middle East, about Russia, China and his new book which is really truly extraordinary. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=69.44s)]
*  And then we talk to Ravi Gupta. He is the host of a new limited series from Crooked Media and the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=74.08s)]
*  Branch called Killing Justice. I've been involved in this series. I've listened to the first three [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=80.16s)]
*  episodes. They're incredible. You should check that out. We'll talk about this mysterious case [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=85.44s)]
*  of a judge's murder in India, the difficulty of getting to the truth and what it says about [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=90.08s)]
*  where India and Indian democracy is going. Before we get to my interview with the Prime Minister [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=94.56s)]
*  though, I do want to just bring people up to speed on a really terrible tragedy that took place on [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=98.32s)]
*  Sunday. Over 45 civilians were killed and more than 200 injured in an Israeli strike [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=104.48s)]
*  on a displacement camp in Rafa that ignited a huge fire. If you've seen any of this, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=110.64s)]
*  it's absolutely unimaginable suffering inside a tent camp. We've seen just charred bodies of [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=117.28s)]
*  civilians. We've seen children killed, a beheaded child. The worst kind of scenes of [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=125.6s)]
*  civilian suffering in war that one can imagine. The Israeli government has said that the strike [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=134.16s)]
*  was targeting two Hamas leaders, but Netanyahu did come out and call the death toll and the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=140.32s)]
*  circumstances of the strike a tragic mistake and said that they're investigating, that the IDF is [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  investigating. The Israelis say that their munitions alone couldn't have caused the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=151.84s)]
*  mass of fire and are looking into all possibilities, including the option that weapons [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=157.20000000000002s)]
*  stored in a compound next to the target may have ignited as a result of the strike. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=162.08s)]
*  I'll come back to that in a second. That's also not all. Palestinian officials say at least 29 [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=167.76s)]
*  people were killed in two separate strikes in Rafa on Tuesday. Israeli tanks were rolling to the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=172.8s)]
*  center of Rafa for the first time. According to UNRWA, which was in charge of that facility that [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=178.32s)]
*  was burnt, 1 million people have now left Rafa over the last few weeks. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  We'll talk more about this next week with Tommy. I think the one thing I would offer on this [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=191.76s)]
*  is this is exactly why people said that they should not go into Rafa, because things like [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=196.79999999999998s)]
*  this were going to happen, because they've happened in the other places where Israel's [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=201.76s)]
*  done these kind of ground invasions. Whatever you're doing, if you are lighting tent encampments [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=205.68s)]
*  with children in an area that was a declared safe zone, that Israel said was a safe zone, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=214.08s)]
*  then you're doing something deeply, profoundly, morally wrong. The fact that it came less than, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=220.48000000000002s)]
*  I don't know, a couple of days after the ICJ, the International Court of Justice, demanded a halt [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=228.72s)]
*  to Israel's Rafa operation, less than a week after the ICC sought arrest warrants for the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=235.36s)]
*  prosecution of Israel's political leadership for war crimes. Sometimes you run out of words to [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=243.76000000000002s)]
*  describe this conflict. People need to look at what's happening with their eyes, and we can see [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=254.08s)]
*  what's happening in Rafa. It doesn't in any way diminish the horror of what Hamas did. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=260.32s)]
*  There's space for these two things to be true, that this military operation has gone profoundly [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=267.28s)]
*  wrong in a dark, dark way, which we saw most acutely recently in Rafa. That's something that [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=274.0s)]
*  the US has to wrestle with. Look, I have my own history with the phrase red line. Sometimes it's [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=280.88s)]
*  an oversimplification of complicated issues. In this case, President Biden suggested that going [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=288.64s)]
*  into Rafa would be a red line for him, suggesting some kind of cutoff of support. The one thing you [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=293.44s)]
*  cannot argue is that somehow they're not in Rafa. They're bombing Rafa. They're killing civilians [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=299.59999999999997s)]
*  in Rafa. They're tanks in Rafa. If this is not an operation in Rafa, then I don't know what is. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=305.84s)]
*  So can we please just dispense with the semantic games about whether some red line has been crossed? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=312.24s)]
*  It has. The question is, what is the US going to do about it? I believe that it's past time [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=316.56s)]
*  to be much clearer in where we stand in terms of restricting military assistance that's not [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=323.44s)]
*  purely defensive, like air defense, missile defense systems, to be voting for ceasefires at the UN. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=328.8s)]
*  There are a lot of things that can be done to try to send a message that this war needs to end and [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=334.08000000000004s)]
*  we need to get towards a two-state solution. That leads me into my conversation with a leader who's [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=338.40000000000003s)]
*  doing that work, the Prime Minister of Norway. Check out the interview here. We are very pleased [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=343.36s)]
*  to welcome to Pod Save the World a leader that I've long admired and who's taken, I think, a very [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=348.08000000000004s)]
*  practical and brave stance this week. Prime Minister of Norway, Jonas Garstota, thank you [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=356.88s)]
*  so much for being with us. Good to be with you. Thank you. So, Mr. Prime Minister, you in coordination [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=361.76s)]
*  with Spain and Ireland over the course of last week, Norway has joined many other nations in [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=368.24s)]
*  recognizing a Palestinian state. Tell me a bit about why you took this decision to take this step [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=376.0s)]
*  of formal recognition of Palestine and how it came about that you did this in coordination with [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=382.0s)]
*  Ireland and Spain as well. Well, there's a long story about timing. This is not exact science. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=387.52s)]
*  Why was this done 70 years ago or 30 years ago? You know, Norway since the Oslo Accords in 1993, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=394.48s)]
*  we have been supporting and actively supporting a process towards what would end up as two states [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=404.64s)]
*  living side by side. And the intention was that recognition of Palestine, formal recognition of [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=410.48s)]
*  Palestine would happen as part of a broad between Israel and Palestine. Now that has not happened [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=418.64s)]
*  year after year. Still, it has been an objective for Norway's part. We have said over the last years [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=425.68s)]
*  that it was not necessarily linked to such a final peace agreement, but it had to come at the right [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=432.0s)]
*  moment. So why is this the right moment? And this is of course also linked to the tragic war unfolding [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=437.68s)]
*  in Gaza after the terror on the 7th of October, the Hamas terror, the war unfolding. And what is [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=444.32s)]
*  emerging from the international community is that after this war, after the ceasefire that [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=451.04s)]
*  are these hostages, there has to be a new political track towards a two-state solution, something which [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=455.92s)]
*  just Palestine secured in principles based on international law living alongside Israel. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=463.2s)]
*  So our objective was to say that this is the moment to send that signal to Palestinians. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=470.4s)]
*  You are not forgotten. You are not doomed to be dominated by Hamas militant groups and violence [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=476.0s)]
*  down the road spiral of your economy. So the paradox now is that we have never been farther [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=481.76s)]
*  away on the ground, I would say, to have two states living side by side in peace. But politically, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=487.44s)]
*  there's a new momentum coming from the US, from Europe, from the Arab states. And we simply, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=492.71999999999997s)]
*  this is a conflict that has implications all over the world. And we simply have, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=498.88s)]
*  as republic responsible citizens, we have to take decisions that would create a new dynamic [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=504.4s)]
*  from a very complex point of departure. But that's why we believe it was right. Why Spain and Ireland? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=510.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, to do this as one country, I think would be a missed opportunity. Madrid and Oslo were [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=516.56s)]
*  important to kick off what happened with the Oslo process. So there's some [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=524.4s)]
*  message in Spain and Norway, Ireland came along, and I believe there will be more European states [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=528.88s)]
*  also coming in the near future. Yeah, I thought actually the symbolism was quite powerful of [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=534.56s)]
*  Spain and Norway, given how central Madrid and Oslo were to basically what we know is the peace [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=539.04s)]
*  process. And I was going to follow up on this question of what happens next, because the US [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=546.88s)]
*  position for a long time has been, I use these talking points for eight years, they're used [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=552.56s)]
*  before me, they've been used after me. We believe that the two states solution should be negotiated [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=558.4799999999999s)]
*  by the parties and we don't like steps that go around that process, essentially. Now, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=563.28s)]
*  clearly that has failed. And I think in some ways Norway taking this step, it's pretty profound [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=569.4399999999999s)]
*  because it's kind of signaling, it's been what 30 years since Oslo, but it is kind of saying, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=575.3599999999999s)]
*  guys, this is not working and that we need to be open to different approaches. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=580.48s)]
*  And I think if you assess the landscape now, you have an Israeli government that rejects [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=584.72s)]
*  a Palestinian state. You have, well, in Hamas, a part of the Palestinian leadership rejects [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=588.16s)]
*  Israel, the Palestinian Authority accepts it. You've got this Abraham Accords process that kind of [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=595.2s)]
*  ignored the Palestinians, and you have this kind of direct recognition of Palestine by now 140 plus [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=600.72s)]
*  countries at the United Nations. Where do you see these pieces? I mean, I know you're kind of [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=607.28s)]
*  someone who thinks about the puzzle pieces of geopolitics. Where do you see this going forward? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=612.0s)]
*  What is the role of Europe? Because in the past, I think, Europe, the US pressured Europe to not do [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=617.12s)]
*  things like this. What does this say about the role of Europe in trying to address a situation in [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=622.16s)]
*  which kind of US brokered peace talks are clearly not working? Well, first of all, on foreign policy [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=627.28s)]
*  in general, I mean, on your book, you discussed, you know, foreign policy, how do you exercise it? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=632.72s)]
*  And I think it is with foreign policy, like many other areas of life. If you do this, keep on doing [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=638.0s)]
*  the same thing year after year at its sales, at some stage you have to say, okay, is changing a [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=643.28s)]
*  course, is it the profound change, or is it simply trying to reach your objectives with other means? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=649.28s)]
*  And for my case, Norway's case, it is the latter. Because we have always, you know, a Tuesday [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=655.12s)]
*  solution will not be an easy thing. But you have to hold it against the alternative, which is what [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=661.12s)]
*  we have seen now, downward spiral. And honestly speaking, you know, the other alternative, a one [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=665.76s)]
*  state solution where people would live inside one state, that would have to be on the basis of equal [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=670.96s)]
*  rights. And that will not happen. I mean, Israel is against the two state solution and against that [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=676.24s)]
*  other option. And that's why what I'm saying is that yes, there is a change to opposition, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=681.44s)]
*  it has not worked. And now we have a government in Israel that openly says it will not support it. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=686.24s)]
*  So what is the puzzle, Devin? As I see it, you know, the way the, I acknowledge the complexity [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=692.64s)]
*  of being American administration now, it is a very complex task. And I respect that. I've heard [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=698.08s)]
*  President Biden's very clear message about the two state solution. And I think with the Arab state, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=704.24s)]
*  you know, what they are doing now is to, there are apparent records, but there is also upgrading [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=709.76s)]
*  the 2002 Arab peace plan, which basically says that we, the Arab world now much more profoundly, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=714.8s)]
*  we will live with Israel, we will respect Israel, we will recognize Israel normal relations. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=721.04s)]
*  But this is the triangle that the other part, the second part of the triangle is that we have to [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=726.9599999999999s)]
*  recognize that part, which is called Palestine. If you don't do that, you will continue to be hampered [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=732.0799999999999s)]
*  by violence and our spiral. And the third part is, you know, the way the US will play its role in [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=738.48s)]
*  this region, you know, ranging from security guarantee arrangements presence. And, you know, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=745.2s)]
*  Norway chaired this meeting alongside this weekend, alongside Saudi Arabia, a meeting of Arab [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=750.32s)]
*  ministers and European ministers on this issue. So I believe here there is a dynamic which the US [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=755.52s)]
*  actually can use, because this is something we have to put together as pieces, both as regards [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=761.52s)]
*  Gaza, what will Gaza be in the future? How do we take care of a Palestinian authority, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=767.84s)]
*  which needs to reform profoundly? And that was the second meeting Norway chaired this [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=773.12s)]
*  weekend, because we chaired a donor support group with deputy secretary from the US Kurt [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=777.76s)]
*  Campbell present giving a very strong address of how we have to support the reforms of the new [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=782.96s)]
*  Palestinian administrations. So there are many pieces in these puzzles, and you just have to [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=788.1600000000001s)]
*  work on them side by side. But for me, fundamentally, the day after this war, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=794.4s)]
*  when we started to look ahead, we're worried to have this every second year, Palestinians [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=799.1999999999999s)]
*  assert the integrity of what state gives around the notion of Palestine, if you see what I mean. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=804.8s)]
*  Yeah. And that I believe is giving hope to people in Gaza, and not to forget the West Bank, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=810.64s)]
*  which is really now in a very dire situation. And you know, I keep telling my Israeli friends, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=816.9599999999999s)]
*  if you let the PA collapse, if you go on, as you do on the West Bank, you're going to have [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=821.76s)]
*  havoc also on that side. Yeah, you mentioned that, you know, you [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=826.8s)]
*  chaired these meetings in the ad hoc liaison committee, this is a collection of countries [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=831.52s)]
*  that are providing assistance to the Palestinians. It's interesting when you think about it, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=836.88s)]
*  if you go around essentially like a peace process that in my experience, under Prime Minister Netanyahu, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=844.08s)]
*  at least, it was often meant to play for time, you know, nothing happens, they build more [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=850.88s)]
*  settlements, they change facts on the ground in the West Bank. That's my view. But the thing [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=855.84s)]
*  about recognition and assistance is, you know, in a way, you kind of have to just start building [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=862.24s)]
*  the Palestinian state in the West Bank in particular, instead of kind of waiting for some [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=868.08s)]
*  negotiated process that there's clearly a need. I mean, what do you see as the needs for [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=873.52s)]
*  the Palestinian leadership side? How do you build something that is representative of the Palestinians [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=880.88s)]
*  that is responsive to their concerns that addresses some of these issues around [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=886.72s)]
*  corruption? And frankly, some of these issues around just an elderly leadership that's kind [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=891.68s)]
*  of been somewhat humiliated by Israel over the years. I mean, what do you see as the most important [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=895.92s)]
*  ways in which donor countries, and that's often going to be Europe and Arab states, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=900.24s)]
*  can contribute to a different Palestinian leadership than Hamas or a kind of Palestinian [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=904.88s)]
*  authority that feels like it needs a bit of a 2.0 version? Well, let's be fair about history here. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=909.2s)]
*  I mean, the leadership on the Palestinian side, if you go back to 2005, they were people who were, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=915.5200000000001s)]
*  I think, honest people. They were non-Wisdom. They recognized Israel. They wanted to respect, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=922.4000000000001s)]
*  you know, UN resolutions. I was foreign minister at the time. I worked in long-suffice [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=929.12s)]
*  private minister Sanam Fayyad, who was an able guy who put the economy back on track. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=933.44s)]
*  In 2011, in September, there was a whole flag going ahead of the UN building of a new state. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=938.96s)]
*  That was South Sudan, which was very able to run itself. It could have been Palestine, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=945.6800000000001s)]
*  because at the time, the World Bank and the IMF said that they run their economy in a decent way. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=952.1600000000001s)]
*  And it has gone the wrong way. It has just gone downwards. And you know, we now know that this [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=958.96s)]
*  has been partly the objective of successive Israeli governments. Yes, yes. I totally agree. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=965.2s)]
*  To divide and rule the Palestinians, to say to the international community, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=971.12s)]
*  we have no counterpart. And of course, Hamas has a tremendous responsibility for spoiling these [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=976.96s)]
*  processes. And you know, some are saying that recognizing Palestine now would be the wrong [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=983.6s)]
*  signal to Hamas. I would say the contrary. Hamas is against Israel. We are in favor. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=987.6s)]
*  Hamas is against two-state solution. We are in favor. Hamas is in favor of violence. We are against. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=993.36s)]
*  So we have to give the Palestinian again this integrity that comes from UN resolution, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=999.36s)]
*  from normal statehood. And then the Palestinian authority, you know, being prime minister there [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1003.84s)]
*  now, is it extremely complex? They have to reform. Their leadership has been there. You know, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1010.8s)]
*  how could you hold elections in these areas over the successive years? But obviously, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1014.7199999999999s)]
*  there has to be reform and renewal and moving ahead on major fronts. I know about it. So [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1020.16s)]
*  it's going to be easy, though. But I think, you know, the point of departure to say that [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1026.8799999999999s)]
*  we have clear expectations to you, Palestinian authority. We will support you. But here is what [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1031.12s)]
*  we also want you to do. That's what we want you to move in. And what about the US? It's the one [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1036.48s)]
*  country that has some amount of leverage, or at least the most amount of leverage on Israel. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1041.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, if you listen to the podcast, you know, I have my frustrations with this. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1046.32s)]
*  But I know you're a close friend of the US on so many issues and worked hand in glove on Ukraine. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1050.48s)]
*  I'm just wondering how you would express, you know, as a friend, how concerned are you that, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1057.92s)]
*  one, about just the US kind of continuing to provide pretty significant support to Israel in [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1063.2800000000002s)]
*  this war, but also kind of, you know, the danger of the US being so out of step with what seems [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1069.0400000000002s)]
*  like world opinion and so out of step with organizations like the ICC and the ICJ. How [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1075.44s)]
*  should we Americans think about the risks to the kind of status quo approach, like you said, that [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1081.68s)]
*  we keep doing even though it doesn't keep working? Well, Ben, I mean, from your years in the [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1088.16s)]
*  administration, I think you know that Norway really puts itself in the global podcast giving [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1092.72s)]
*  advice. And you know, on the Middle East, let me say this, the Oslo Accords led to Oslo because [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1099.6000000000001s)]
*  there was this very close and trusted coordination between Norway and the US. And obviously what we [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1105.8400000000001s)]
*  have done by recognizing is something that the US is not doing at the moment. We have explained, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1111.8400000000001s)]
*  we agree on the objective, but you know, we saw this as the right step for us to move now. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1116.56s)]
*  Bioconvolute is a very complex roller in. I think, you know, they have to go on and give very clear [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1121.2s)]
*  signals. There has to be some conditions with those signals. And what has happened now in [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1126.24s)]
*  Raqqa, what happens around these international court issues, you know, has profound implications, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1131.04s)]
*  I think, on Europe. And I would like to see, you know, nobody will ever question that the US is [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1136.24s)]
*  there as a guarantor for Israel. And you know, I hear this government in Israel talking about [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1141.44s)]
*  all those who are against them and enemies against them. I think, you know, Israel in its foundation [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1150.24s)]
*  has pretty solid support, you know, for being a state living in a complex environment, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1155.1200000000001s)]
*  living in a very, you know, with Iran and all the rest of it, we are on line there. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1160.16s)]
*  But you know, when we do as we do is we see that moving ahead as we have done in previous years, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1164.24s)]
*  is a disaster for the Palestinians, it is decreasing security for the Israelis, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1171.44s)]
*  and is as profound ramifications beyond the reach. And there is where the US comes in. And I still [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1176.24s)]
*  wish to have a world where the US have a currency and the role and the word and the action of the [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1183.2s)]
*  US really weighs in. And that's why I really hope that, you know, we will be able to end the war and [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1188.3200000000002s)]
*  then to move on to that next chapter, which I want to see our recognition really as for the next [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1194.4s)]
*  chapter. As an investment in, you know, a different approach that might accelerate a Palestinian state [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1200.1599999999999s)]
*  in reality. I do want to just ask you one question on Ukraine, because you've been so out front on [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1205.6s)]
*  that issue as well. You know, we're in this moment when it feels like the battlefield momentum is [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1211.52s)]
*  shifted a bit against the Ukrainians. President Zelensky has kind of been appealing for additional [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1218.6399999999999s)]
*  support, additional kinds of weapon systems, or perhaps help in shooting things down. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1224.64s)]
*  But in general, it just feels like there's a status quo that is a bit uncomfortable. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1230.96s)]
*  Where do you see the war right now? And what kind of things, either politically or militarily, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1237.44s)]
*  do you think Ukraine supporters need to at least consider going forward to try to [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1243.2800000000002s)]
*  shake the momentum in a better direction? Well, first think about it, that Ukraine has been able [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1247.92s)]
*  to hold back, you know, this massive invasion and the enormous globalisation from Russia itself, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1252.0s)]
*  very telling. I believe that, I mean, for Norway, being in Europe, a neighbour to Russia, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1258.48s)]
*  you know, we see that defending Ukraine's right to defend itself is a core principle, I believe, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1266.8s)]
*  you know, vis-a-vis Ukraine, but also for the security of Korea. And what we need to do now [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1273.84s)]
*  is really to hear its call. And that is for air defence, primarily. That is critically important. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1279.76s)]
*  And well, important parts of the air defence now defending the Ukrainian cities comes from [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1284.56s)]
*  Norwegian technology. We produce this, this nascent battery system, and there's take-rits [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1289.52s)]
*  and others, but we really have to come up and see what can we do to support them. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1294.4s)]
*  And then I think, you know, we support Ukraine's right to defend itself. At some stage, there has [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1299.44s)]
*  to be moving over to a new phase where we are not seeing this as a stalemate on battlefield. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1306.4s)]
*  From my perspective, this has to be Ukraine's call. You know, when are we in a situation where [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1314.64s)]
*  you can move into a different phase? There will be a NATO summit. There will be in mid-July in D.C. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1320.64s)]
*  There will be a meeting in Switzerland mid-June about, you know, the peace formula, countries [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1327.6000000000001s)]
*  coming together. And I think we also have the political to work on that. Last remark is that, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1332.24s)]
*  you know, Russia will be there also after this war. Sometimes I hear people talk about Europe [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1339.1200000000001s)]
*  as they are kind of with a pair of scissors taking Russia away from the European map. We [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1346.16s)]
*  have to consider and conceptualise European security order in the future that will give [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1351.04s)]
*  security to countries small and large. You know, there are large countries such as Russia, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1356.32s)]
*  who would like to go back to spheres of influence, the kind of Yolta 1945 scenario. That is not Europe [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1362.1599999999999s)]
*  for the 21st century. And Europe had the biggest toolbox of resolving conflicts of disorder [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1369.2s)]
*  of any continent. And we need to get back to the thinking of how that should be. And I'm a bit [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1375.2s)]
*  weary that we are now constantly talking military escalation, and it is necessary, but we also need [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1380.56s)]
*  some ourselves. It's just, you know, war security order is best for you. If you go back to World War [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1386.0s)]
*  II, the World War II post-World War order was started to be conceptualised, you know, in 1942, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1391.44s)]
*  1943. And we now have to spend also time on looking how we can avoid this terrible [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1399.84s)]
*  tragedy unfolding in Ukraine to happen elsewhere. That's very interesting. I just want to say, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1407.2s)]
*  I mean, because it ties together the two things we've been talking about, right? So you're sitting [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1412.16s)]
*  there and you're thinking as the leader of Norway, which has a kind of additional role in terms of [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1415.68s)]
*  diplomacy and assistance over the years, it's kind of one of the kind of better behaved stakeholders [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1421.68s)]
*  in the international order. But you're looking at both the situation in Israel and Palestine and [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1427.3600000000001s)]
*  in Russia, Ukraine. And what kind of ties this together is thinking about both how do you weather [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1432.96s)]
*  the storm that we're in. But in both cases, you're talking about, hey, we actually need to start [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1438.96s)]
*  thinking about what's the future of Palestine and Israel? What's the future of Russia and Ukraine? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1444.32s)]
*  Yeah. And there's one more dimension to this, which I like to highlight. And that is, you know, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1449.6s)]
*  we travel around in the global south to explain the meaning of this war in Ukraine, you know, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1453.6799999999998s)]
*  trying to call their attention to how serious this is. And then comes Gaza, and then comes the [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1459.6799999999998s)]
*  question of do you have double standards? Yeah. And that is a critical issue. And you know, for me, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1465.36s)]
*  you know, you cannot compare these two conflicts because they are too different. But human lives [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1471.52s)]
*  can be compared. And that is why I think, you know, having, you know, today I've been traveling [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1478.72s)]
*  around Norway, visiting schools and universities just to see what this does to people, you know, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1486.08s)]
*  the young generation get all these news, not by text explanation, but by images coming in on their [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1492.24s)]
*  mobile phones, you know, all kinds of social media. And they keep asking, you know, it's a life, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1498.4s)]
*  it's a murder, a murder, it's a disaster, disaster. And, you know, it's not a one to one. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1504.72s)]
*  But there's a bigger picture where we, I think, who believe we belong to the free world and these [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1509.68s)]
*  principles, we have to be very aware of these days to not to be, you know, falling into double [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1516.64s)]
*  standard baskets. Yeah. In some ways, it's more important than ever to avoid that. Well, look, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1521.92s)]
*  I really appreciate you coming on and explaining a very consequential week in Norwegian foreign [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1526.96s)]
*  policy. And as people heard, you're thoughtful always on these issues and trying to see the big [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1532.88s)]
*  picture. So thanks for joining us and look forward to keeping in touch. Thank you so much. Today, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1538.72s)]
*  we have a very exciting co-host, a good friend of mine, journalist, author and CNN host, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1543.68s)]
*  Fareed Zakaria. Fareed, so glad to have you here. Thanks for joining us. Great to be here. I'm a fan, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1550.88s)]
*  so this is so much fun for me. People should know, first of all, Fareed, you know, probably, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1556.08s)]
*  you know, perhaps Barack Obama's favorite commentator. So part of my job in the White [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1561.9199999999998s)]
*  House was not only to talk to you as a journalist, but to make sure that I, you know, I was getting [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1566.56s)]
*  your commentary in front of the boss so he didn't miss any of it because he always wanted to see it. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1573.12s)]
*  But you're also the author of an extraordinary new book that we're going to talk about in a few [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1576.72s)]
*  minutes called Age of Revolutions. I just can, at the top, let me just congratulate you and [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1580.56s)]
*  encourage everybody to pick this one up. This is really a sweeping look at what's happening now [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1585.36s)]
*  through the prism of revolutions past and history. So really looking forward to talking to you about [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1591.6s)]
*  that. But we're going to dive in with some revolutionary activity that's happening around [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1597.52s)]
*  the world, Fareed, if that's okay with you. That's totally fine. Okay, well, let's start [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1602.7199999999998s)]
*  with Gaza. It's been a busy week, to say the least. I'm just going to give a quick recap here. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1607.4399999999998s)]
*  We talked in the last podcast about the ICC requesting arrest warrants for the leaders of [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1613.5200000000002s)]
*  Hamas and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and Defense Minister Gallant. Then since then, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1619.2800000000002s)]
*  we've had some additional steps taken. Spain, Norway, and Ireland went out in a coordinated [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1625.44s)]
*  fashion to say that they would recognize a Palestinian state formally. Fareed, we're just [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1630.4s)]
*  going to play a quick clip here from what the Irish Prime Minister, the Taoiseach, had to say [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1634.5600000000002s)]
*  about this decision on your network on CNN. What is happening at the moment in Palestine [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1638.4s)]
*  is unconscionable and is almost unimaginable. And I don't yet think the world comprehends the [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1643.2800000000002s)]
*  scale of devastation facing Palestinian civilians. And we cannot turn a blind eye. And I will not [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1649.2800000000002s)]
*  allow a scenario where in years to come, people ask me, what did you do at that moment? And people [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1654.88s)]
*  ask Ireland, what did you do at that moment? The answer cannot be that we stayed silent. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1660.3200000000002s)]
*  We must stand up for human rights, stand up against breaches of international law, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1664.3999999999999s)]
*  and call out this humanitarian catastrophe. And really, the only way you resolve this conflict [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1670.72s)]
*  is through peaceful political dialogue. So this is largely symbolic in the sense that [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1676.6399999999999s)]
*  these countries join over 140 countries at the United Nations General Assembly who've [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1683.2s)]
*  recognized Palestine, but at the same time, it doesn't create a Palestinian state and the US [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1688.24s)]
*  would continue to veto the creation of a Palestinian state through the UN Security Council. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1693.68s)]
*  That said, as I'm working my way up to Questionnaire Fried, but there's so much news to get through, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1698.64s)]
*  this adds to kind of the momentum, I think, of pressure on Israel and pressure on the old [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1704.0s)]
*  paradigm of the peace process. Netanyahu, of course, condemned it, called it a reward for terrorism. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1709.1200000000001s)]
*  But then, just this morning, before we began talking here, the International Court of Justice [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1714.4s)]
*  announced that Israel must halt its military operation in Ra'afah. Here's how Judge Nawaf [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1720.16s)]
*  Salam, the president of the ICJ, the highest court in the world, explained this move. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1725.52s)]
*  Israel must immediately halt its military offensive and any other action in the Ra'afah [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1729.8400000000001s)]
*  Governorate, which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1735.68s)]
*  about its physical destruction in whole or in part. So this is citing immediate risk to civilians [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1742.64s)]
*  in Ra'afah and this comes after the ICJ previously kind of warned of the potential for genocide, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1750.4s)]
*  and you heard him use language about the destruction of the Palestinian people in Gaza in whole or in [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1755.6000000000001s)]
*  part. So to summarize here, we've got the ICC issuing arrest warrants for the Prime Minister [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1760.3200000000002s)]
*  of Israel. We've got three European nations which have generally not recognized Palestine in the [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1765.44s)]
*  same percentage as its other nations taking that step this week. And then today we have the ICJ [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1771.28s)]
*  issuing this order. Meanwhile, in US politics, you know, the Biden administration condemned the ICC [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1777.2s)]
*  and then just yesterday, the US Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, announced that [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1782.96s)]
*  Bibi Netanyahu will be invited by him and Chuck Schumer to address a joint session of Congress. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1787.12s)]
*  So where I start after all that, is just how you make sense of someone as nobody is better than you [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1792.08s)]
*  at following both US politics and global politics. This gap between where the US government is and [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1798.4s)]
*  US Congress is and the rest of the world, I don't even know how to describe it anymore. I mean, how [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1804.3200000000002s)]
*  do you put in context the different views that we saw this week from Washington versus the rest of [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1809.76s)]
*  the world? No, you're absolutely right. This is one of the areas where the United States is just in [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1815.44s)]
*  a completely different place than almost all of the rest of the world. Some countries in Europe, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1820.24s)]
*  to be fair, are also very different from where Spain is, for example. The Germans have been very [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1825.6s)]
*  strong supporters of Israel for obvious historical reasons. The UK has tended to be very supportive. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1834.48s)]
*  India has tended to be very supportive. And so there are unusual cases. Hungary, bizarrely, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1840.6399999999999s)]
*  is very supportive of Bibi Netanyahu. They don't say, Obran doesn't seem to like most Jews, but [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1846.1599999999999s)]
*  he's found one he likes. But look, I think the best way to think about this is where does this [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1853.92s)]
*  take us? Where does it go? The pressure on Israel is real, even though the Israelis will deny it. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1860.96s)]
*  They don't want to feel like a pariah state. They felt like one of the great things that had happened [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1867.3600000000001s)]
*  in Israel over the last 10 years was the increasing normalization of Israel, perhaps because it was [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1872.16s)]
*  seen as a kind of tech superpower, whatever. And that gave Israelis immense sense of pride. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1878.32s)]
*  But it is important to think about the reality. Israel has the power on the ground. All this [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1885.2s)]
*  pressure makes no difference if it doesn't move Israel, because the Security Council can't grant [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1891.28s)]
*  a Palestinian state. Only one country in the world can do it, and that is Israel. Israel controls [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1898.8799999999999s)]
*  that ground. It is not going to allow a Palestinian state to happen just because somebody in the UN [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1904.72s)]
*  passes a resolution. So the American position of hugging Israel both expresses certain American [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1912.88s)]
*  values, I suppose. But I would argue just strategically, it is a smart place to be if you [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1920.16s)]
*  can use that hug to privately pressure the Israeli government. And I would argue the Biden people [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1926.64s)]
*  are actually now doing something that is positive and strategic and has a chance of working. I don't [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1934.4s)]
*  want to say more than that because, look, you can always make money betting against the peace in the [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1946.4s)]
*  Middle East, the Israeli-Palestinian process. But what the Biden people are trying to do is just go [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1954.16s)]
*  to the Saudis, go to the Egyptians, go to the UAE and the company, but above all, go to the Saudis [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1960.08s)]
*  and say, do you want this deal, a normalization with Israel, diplomatic relations with Israel, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1965.6s)]
*  in return for which the US will give you security guarantees, you get a civilian nuclear program, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1972.08s)]
*  and Israel has to make the concession of a credible and irreversible path to a Palestinian state. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1977.6s)]
*  The Saudis have basically said yes. So the question is, how do you get the Israelis to recognize that [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1984.48s)]
*  this is a deal of a lifetime? This is what they have always wanted, normalized relations with [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1990.96s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, the custodian of the two holy mosques, the largest funder of Arab governments. So [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=1996.3200000000002s)]
*  that really would integrate Israel into the region, which has always been the dream. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2002.16s)]
*  And what they have to do is recognize that they need to do something serious and real with the [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2007.6000000000001s)]
*  Palestinians. And what they have been doing is reminding Bibi Netanyahu that he is on the record [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2014.16s)]
*  in favor of a Palestinian state. He gave a very famous speech at Bar-i-Lan, which he gave because [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2021.3600000000001s)]
*  you, Ben Rhodes, and your boss Barack Obama essentially pressured him into doing it, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2027.0400000000002s)]
*  but he's now on the record. And so there is potentially a deal here. And let's be [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2032.4s)]
*  crass political about this. Bibi needs something like this to get out of the mess he's in, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2039.04s)]
*  to restore his credibility, to give the sense that he's a winner and he can get a diplomatic [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2045.6s)]
*  triumph out of it. And if you want a Palestinian state, you need a right-wing politician to deliver [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2051.52s)]
*  it. If a left-wing politician in Israel proposes or agrees to a Palestinian state, it will not [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2058.4s)]
*  happen because the right-wing will tear it apart. So for all those reasons, I realize I'm trying to [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2065.6s)]
*  find the silver lining in a very dark cloud, but I think A, there is one, and B, you've got to give [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2071.2799999999997s)]
*  the Biden administration credit on this. People have pilloried it. I've been tough on them at times [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2077.36s)]
*  because I thought they should have been reigning in Israel much earlier and much more, but they [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2083.8399999999997s)]
*  are now in a place where they are trying to take this crisis and finding it an opportunity. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2088.88s)]
*  So I guess as someone who's been a little more skeptical, but like you said, it's always easy [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2095.52s)]
*  to bet on skepticism in this. The data points I look at are an Israeli right that actually doesn't [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2101.7599999999998s)]
*  see Saudi normalization as the goal. They see basically they want all the land. And here, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2110.56s)]
*  I mean, Ben Gavir and Smoltrek, the far right clearly would prefer to control the West Bank and [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2117.3599999999997s)]
*  Gaza than to have a Saudi normalization deal. Netanyahu has kind of generally, when push comes [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2124.0s)]
*  to shove, broken in that direction. And so I guess just the follow-up I would have is, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2132.88s)]
*  I understand that play, but I also feel like we've done the hug strategy basically since Oslo [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2139.12s)]
*  with some friction along the way, and I was a part of some of that friction. Do you see, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2146.8s)]
*  what is the utility of this kind of three-dimensional puzzle? Because I think [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2151.28s)]
*  there's a role for pressure. And so you've got these, call it bad cops, but you've got [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2156.96s)]
*  the Europeans saying, we're done with direct negotiations. That leads nowhere. That's how the [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2161.6800000000003s)]
*  Israeli government has played for time in the past. We're going to shortcut the recognition to [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2166.4s)]
*  apply some pressure here. You've got obviously the international legal proceedings, which are [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2171.52s)]
*  kind of a different track. Then you've got this kind of Abraham's accords track from the Gulf. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2175.44s)]
*  What is the manner in which that assembles? Where does the place for pressure versus the [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2182.1600000000003s)]
*  place for diplomacy come, particularly when you're dealing with, as you said, an endgame that is [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2187.6000000000004s)]
*  inside of Israeli politics, which is very hard to control? Yeah. I mean, look, obviously you're [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2192.0800000000004s)]
*  making a lot of very smart points. So to be clear, in order for this to work, Bibi would have to [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2197.52s)]
*  announce that he was in favor of a Palestinian state, which would mean he would lose those two [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2205.9199999999996s)]
*  extreme right-wing members of his coalition, Ben Gavir and Smirilic, and they would collapse [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2214.08s)]
*  the government as a result. There would be new elections. And Bibi's theory would have to be, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2219.9199999999996s)]
*  he would now be able to form a more centrist coalition, which to be fair was how he's always [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2225.12s)]
*  governed. This is the exception over the last 20 years. So this would take him back to more of a [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2231.6s)]
*  kind of liquid and center-right coalition. They would win the election because he was promising [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2237.68s)]
*  Saudi normalization and things like that. Of course it could not happen. But on the other [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2244.64s)]
*  hand, if it doesn't happen in another center-right politician, and I know that Naftali Bennett [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2249.04s)]
*  thinks that this is a perfect opportunity for him, might step in and do something like that, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2254.16s)]
*  maybe even, you know, Galand or something like that. So it's a tough one. But your larger question [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2259.28s)]
*  is a very good one, which is could American pressure work better? Look, American pressure [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2265.6000000000004s)]
*  could work if you were able to convince the Israelis that this did not present an existential [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2270.96s)]
*  threat to them. Israel has lived under a kind of garrison fortress mentality for much of its [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2277.2000000000003s)]
*  existence. It has not worried about external pressure. From 48 to 73, the United States was [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2284.08s)]
*  not particularly supportive of Israel. 67 is really the shift with the Johnson administration. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2291.36s)]
*  So they've been alone and they felt fine. So I'm not sure it would be as effective as people do. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2297.2s)]
*  But the other piece of it is in order for it to be effective, we have to talk about the reality of [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2304.88s)]
*  politics in America too, which is no president can do this in a context in which this is a [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2309.92s)]
*  deeply partisan issue and he's going to get outflanked. And the best example of this was [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2316.56s)]
*  Obama with the Iran nuclear deal. Bibi was determined to scuttle the deal. Obama was basically [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2322.16s)]
*  putting a lot of pressure, you correct me if I'm wrong about this, and Bibi does an end run where [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2329.36s)]
*  he gets the Republicans to invite him and give a joint session of Congress and essentially [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2334.0s)]
*  undermines everything Obama is doing as a result of which the Iran nuclear deal ends up being [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2338.08s)]
*  an executive agreement, which then Trump can pull out. The whole thing was a disaster because the [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2343.12s)]
*  Iran nuclear deal was a very effective diplomatic triumph in many ways where you got Iran. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2349.44s)]
*  There's a part of one of Bibi's speeches that I was reading because I wrote a little bit about this, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2357.2s)]
*  where he says the reason you should have sanctions on Iran, the reason you should keep [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2363.52s)]
*  Iran in a box is because they've never agreed to destroy their enrichment facilities. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2368.96s)]
*  If they do, we should react. And of course, you guys got them to go down to basically 3%. It was [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2375.7599999999998s)]
*  a total destruction of their- And destroyed their plutonium reactor. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2380.96s)]
*  And destroyed their blood. I literally put cement over it. So even though it was a very well crafted [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2384.08s)]
*  strategy, the pressure didn't work because the Republicans created an escape valve. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2390.96s)]
*  And if that's the reality, we can bemoan it, but you're not going to be able to use effective [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2397.28s)]
*  pressure. Yeah. Well, it all would have worked if Donald Trump didn't get elected in 2016. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2404.2400000000002s)]
*  That's American politics. It's not just Israeli politics, right? It's American politics. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2409.6s)]
*  And by the way, that had a follow on effect in Iran. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2413.12s)]
*  Exactly. Which is, I don't want to [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2415.76s)]
*  exaggerate the degree to which there are reformers and hardliners in Iran. It's a [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2417.44s)]
*  hardline theocracy, but there was a spectrum. And the people who wanted more integration and less [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2421.92s)]
*  of a kind of aggressive foreign policy were totally discredited once Trump pulled out of [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2429.92s)]
*  the deal. And the hardliners who had always been against the Iran nuclear deal are now totally [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2435.12s)]
*  triumphant and totally in control in Iran. So the whole thing has been a disaster, but it was [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2440.88s)]
*  precisely because we had this partisan division in the United States. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2446.96s)]
*  Yeah. Well, it foreshadows what we'll talk about a little bit later with your book, [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2451.2s)]
*  because it's also how hardline politics in different places kind of reinforces each other, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2454.32s)]
*  which brings us to the high priest of hardline politics in the world today, Vladimir Putin, [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2459.52s)]
*  and the war in Ukraine. So it's not been trending well, Freed, as you've been covering. Russia [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2466.0s)]
*  has continued its military advance on Kharkiv, making pretty steady incremental gains. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2473.04s)]
*  I think Zelensky has been out asking, with increasing urgency, for permission to use [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2479.12s)]
*  weapons that he's been provided on Russian soil for help in shooting things down. There's some [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2487.2s)]
*  debate after Tony Blinken's recent trip to Ukraine within the Biden administration about how far to [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2493.68s)]
*  go with that. I wanted to ask you as someone who, like me, I think you've been incredibly [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2498.4s)]
*  sympathetic to and supportive of the Ukrainians, and also probably a bit worried about Russia's [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2504.8s)]
*  not going anywhere. So the idea of a total military defeat of Russia has always seemed [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2510.96s)]
*  kind of a bit fanciful. And I think some people got a little too predictive of that and hyperbolic [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2516.32s)]
*  in the belief that you could completely dislodge Russia from, say, Crimea. What do you make of this [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2523.92s)]
*  balance between, does it help to reach a better negotiated settlement to kind of open up the [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2529.44s)]
*  aperture, let the Ukrainians take some more shots in Russia, give them some more advanced weapons? [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2536.64s)]
*  How do you balance that against the kind of inevitability that there's going to have to be [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2542.0s)]
*  some negotiating at some point? How do you see that, I mean, to continue the theme of kind of [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2546.48s)]
*  three-dimensional impossible puzzles to assemble? Ukraine is asking for those material and that [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2551.36s)]
*  permission at the same time that they're preparing for a peace summit in Switzerland in mid-June, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2558.2400000000002s)]
*  which is mainly about validating their own kind of terms for peace negotiation. Russia's not at that [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2562.48s)]
*  summit. How do you see the mix of military support and diplomacy in the context of what the best [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2568.32s)]
*  outcome could be for Ukraine? Yeah, this is a really tough one. And I think it shows you how [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2575.84s)]
*  people can criticize from the outside, but it's complicated. So if you were to just say, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2581.12s)]
*  let the Ukrainians have everything they want, let them strike deep into Russia, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2587.04s)]
*  shoot down Russian stuff that's over Ukrainian airspace willy-nilly, [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2591.8399999999997s)]
*  Putin has made it clear he would respond. Now, he is threatening to respond with tactical nuclear [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2597.3599999999997s)]
*  weapons. Even if that's not true, Russia is a great power. It has the largest nuclear arsenal [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2602.56s)]
*  in the world. It has a veto in the security council. It has troops spread all over. It has [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2608.24s)]
*  equities in the Middle East. So it is something to be careful about. The West does not want to go to [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2615.8399999999997s)]
*  war with Russia directly. This is something we try to avoid throughout the Cold War for good reason, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2623.04s)]
*  because basically the danger in a situation like that is if you get into a direct confrontation, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2628.4799999999996s)]
*  neither side can back down. This is the classic doom loop of security spiral you get into. And [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2635.2799999999997s)]
*  if each side feels they can't back down, you inevitably get to a point where you are actually [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2642.3199999999997s)]
*  engaged in a major war with another nuclear power. And that could take you up an escalation ladder [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2648.3999999999996s)]
*  that you don't want to go. So that's the fear. All that said, I think the Biden people are probably [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2655.2799999999997s)]
*  being too cautious. I think that there is more they could allow the Ukrainians to particularly [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2659.92s)]
*  give them weaponry that allows them to do it. I also think maybe there's a way to do something [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2664.8s)]
*  that's kind of a bit of a wink-wink saying, we have told the Ukrainians that they can't fire into [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2669.52s)]
*  Russia's territory. We believe they're adhering to that. Nobody's checking on them every day. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2676.7200000000003s)]
*  Nobody's giving them vetoes. If the Ukrainians are firing occasionally missiles a little bit [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2685.84s)]
*  further, it's the fog of war. I wonder whether there's some piece of that. The air defenses part, [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2692.08s)]
*  I'm much more sympathetic to the Ukrainians. Why couldn't you set up an air defense? We saw [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2699.04s)]
*  how well it worked in the case of Israel. And by the way, that one worked in Israel largely because [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2703.76s)]
*  of the United States, not because of the Iron Dome. My understanding is we shot down 50% [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2709.76s)]
*  of the 300 Iranian missiles, drones, cruise missiles that came over. Why couldn't we do [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2715.2s)]
*  something like that? For example, make Kiv impregnable, make Kharkiv impregnable, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2720.72s)]
*  and things like that. So I do think, look, at some level Macron is right when he says, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2727.28s)]
*  are we in this to win? If we're in this to win, why are we tying one hand behind our backs? [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2733.04s)]
*  You know, we need to be clear that we will do what it takes to win. And we shouldn't be signaling in [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2740.0s)]
*  advance that we're not doing, you know, we're taking this off the table, we're taking that off [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2746.16s)]
*  the table. I think that if we took a more aggressive strategy, if we allowed the Ukrainians [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2750.7999999999997s)]
*  to take a more aggressive strategy, we probably would get some victories. But I do agree with [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2758.64s)]
*  your basic point at the end, which is this is going to end in a negotiation. It is going to [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2763.6s)]
*  end in a negotiation which has a settlement that looks roughly like where we are now. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2768.48s)]
*  In other words, the Russians have taken about 18% of Ukraine. They took more than the Ukrainians [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2775.04s)]
*  took back some. I think it's somewhere in the 18 to 20% that the Ukrainians have lost. I don't [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2780.48s)]
*  think they're getting that back. The question is, can you get to the point where the two parties are [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2785.92s)]
*  willing to accept that reality? I don't think they will ever accept the legitimacy of it. The [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2791.28s)]
*  Ukrainians will never recognize that as Russian. The Russians will probably want more. You know, [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2796.56s)]
*  there's historic Russia is actually another 10% of Ukraine. The Russians are not going to get. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2801.52s)]
*  And so the question is, at what point does it feel like you can get to the negotiating table and have [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2807.84s)]
*  a serious conversation about this? Or even an armistice like the Korean War, which is, which [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2814.96s)]
*  may be how this ends. You know, the Korean War is not technically over. They just stop fighting. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2821.04s)]
*  That's why it's called a DMZ, a demilitarized zone. And maybe that's how this ends. But [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2825.44s)]
*  the key, I think, is for us to convince the Ukrainians, look, your goal should be a free, [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2832.8s)]
*  sovereign, democratic Ukraine anchored in the West. The particular size of that Ukraine [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2840.32s)]
*  don't get hung up on. And somebody has to convince the Russians, look, you know, you've become a [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2846.4s)]
*  total pariah. You've been denied access to all this technology. You've been, you know, your economy [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2853.6s)]
*  is in a very, very difficult state. There's a way out. And I wish we had better relations [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2859.2s)]
*  with the Chinese because that would be a very, one very powerful way to go. But if you could get both [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2865.2s)]
*  of those things to happen probably next year, the problem is the Russians are waiting for Trump. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2871.52s)]
*  And they're waiting for Trump and they think Trump is going to surrender for the Ukrainians [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2877.44s)]
*  and cut a deal. And so none of this is going to happen until next year. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2881.68s)]
*  Yeah. Look, I think that's very well said. I mean, at the price of losing Crimea and parts of [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2885.2799999999997s)]
*  Eastern Ukraine are full membership in the West, essentially. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2892.08s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2897.3599999999997s)]
*  I think that's a better, you know, it's obviously not what Ukrainians would want. And I wouldn't [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2898.64s)]
*  expect them to want that. And it's tragic for the Ukrainians that are on the other side of that [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2902.56s)]
*  iron curtain. But I mean, your Korea example is a good one in the sense that that turned out pretty [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2907.6s)]
*  well for South Korea. And that kind of leads me, you mentioned China, to the last piece of this [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2913.12s)]
*  World War Three puzzle that we're trying to avoid. And one of the things I thought about, [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2920.3199999999997s)]
*  Greta, is how much these are the fault lines of unresolved history, which we'll get to in [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2923.6s)]
*  your book in the sense that Ukraine is just beyond the NATO umbrella. Taiwan, unresolved [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2927.2s)]
*  piece of history from obviously the end of the Chinese Revolution. Israel, just beyond treaty [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2932.8s)]
*  obligation, right? So we're kind of all on these fault lines where, you know, Russia, China, Iran [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2940.0800000000004s)]
*  kind of run into the US and its allies. Taiwan is obviously at the forefront of that. And the one [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2946.1600000000003s)]
*  piece of this, it is not an act of conflict yet. They recently inaugurated new president, [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2951.2000000000003s)]
*  William Lai, on May 20th, which predictably heated things up. I'm going to play a short clip here, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2955.6800000000003s)]
*  translated from William Lai's inauguration speech. I want to call on China to cease their political [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2961.12s)]
*  and military intimidation against Taiwan, share the global responsibility of maintaining peace [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2968.3199999999997s)]
*  and stability in the Taiwan Strait, as well as the greater region, and ensure the world is free from [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2974.0s)]
*  the fear of war. So carefully formulated language there, as these things always are out of Taiwan. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2979.7599999999998s)]
*  China, I think inevitably was going to respond to something. And they described some military [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2985.2s)]
*  exercises that they did kind of flexing their muscles around Taiwan as, quote, strong punishment [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2991.8399999999997s)]
*  for the separatist acts of Taiwan independence. William Lai in the past has been more for leaning [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=2996.48s)]
*  and supporting independence. He's moderated as part of his campaign. Now William Lai is touring [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3002.7999999999997s)]
*  military bases in Taiwan. He's talked about kind of a peace through strength approach. He's put their [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3007.52s)]
*  military on alert. What is the best way for Reid to, in continuing our theme of trying to balance [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3012.4s)]
*  the need to stand with a democratic partner, but also to avoid a war that would not be good for that [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3021.76s)]
*  democratic partner as well as everybody else? How are you looking at Taiwan right now? And how do [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3029.12s)]
*  you see the US in particular as the balancing needs to strike between supporting Taiwan, deterring [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3034.4s)]
*  China, but not necessarily provoking China by upping the ante in the kind of arms we provide [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3040.56s)]
*  or security guarantees we provide to Taiwan? First, I want to underscore something you said [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3046.88s)]
*  that I thought was so well put, which I hadn't thought about exactly in that same way, which is [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3051.12s)]
*  that you have these three historically unresolved areas as it were, kind of almost like the detritus [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3056.16s)]
*  of history. And you're having a challenge to the American order and the American [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3064.4s)]
*  hegemony or Western hegemony or the liberal international order, call it what you will. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3071.2s)]
*  But they have found these weak spots precisely because they are historically unresolved. If [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3075.84s)]
*  you think about it, the status of Ukraine is unresolved because it was not just part of the [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3081.04s)]
*  Soviet Union, but part of the Tsarist empire. So it's 300 years old. The occupied territories [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3086.4s)]
*  in the West Bank and Gaza, 56 years unresolved. And of course, Taiwan unresolved since 1949. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3095.2s)]
*  You have tension and you have problems, but these become the tripwires that could actually [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3106.56s)]
*  lead you to conflict. With regard to Taiwan, the thing I worry about is this. The Chinese always [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3113.52s)]
*  had a strategy towards Taiwan, which was that time was on their side. I think Deng Xiaoping [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3122.08s)]
*  once said to Kissinger, look, at the end of the day, we're 1.4 billion people on one side of the [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3128.0s)]
*  Taiwan Straits and there are 22 million people. We're going to be the largest economy in the world. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3134.4s)]
*  Inevitably, the magnetic attraction is going to pull them toward us. Some words to that effect. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3141.2799999999997s)]
*  That really was the Chinese strategy. Kick the can down the road because at the end of the day, [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3147.84s)]
*  these ties will keep building. What's happened, and this is partly because of things that have [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3153.12s)]
*  happened in Taiwan, but partly Xi Jinping, very much more repressive ruler, much more anti-democratic, [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3159.2s)]
*  shut down the promises he made in Hong Kong and democracy in Hong Kong. The Taiwanese look at all [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3167.44s)]
*  of that and they are becoming much more independence minded. What Xi Jinping correctly [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3174.0s)]
*  is realizing is that maybe time is not on his side, that Taiwan is becoming every day, every [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3180.32s)]
*  month, every year, more independence minded, more proud of its democratic character. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3186.72s)]
*  In a very real way, does he have a window of opportunity to act now rather than 10 years from [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3193.52s)]
*  now? To my mind, American strategy has to be a deterrent strategy that is not provocative, [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3200.88s)]
*  but that very slightly in the way that the Chinese keep trying to do a little bit of the salami [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3209.76s)]
*  tactics of adding more flights, more harrassments, very slightly you just keep building up the [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3214.48s)]
*  deterrent capacity. You just keep building up the deterrent capacity. I think again, [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3220.56s)]
*  to give credit to Biden, what he's done is he's taken our policy which has famously been described [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3225.36s)]
*  as strategic ambiguity about whether we would defend Taiwan. The way I would call it is it's [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3231.92s)]
*  strategic ambiguity, but a little less ambiguous. So that four times on the record when he is asked, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3238.88s)]
*  will the United States defend Taiwan, he says yes. He was once asked, wait, you're saying [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3246.96s)]
*  American troops would go in and defend Taiwan? He says yes. The next day, the press asks Jake [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3251.52s)]
*  Sullivan, has American policy toward Taiwan changed? He says, oh no, with the same policy, [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3256.8s)]
*  it's strategic ambiguity. Now, you try to figure out that puzzle, but what I think they're doing [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3262.72s)]
*  is they're saying we're shading strategic ambiguity so it's a little less ambiguous. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3268.72s)]
*  Should they do more? I think it's a very careful game because this is a neurologic issue for China [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3274.0s)]
*  and this is not a Xi Jinping issue. Most people don't realize the Taiwan issue, every Chinese [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3280.24s)]
*  leader has believed. It's in the constitution of the People's Republic of China that Taiwan will [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3286.7999999999997s)]
*  be unified. It is, as you put it, the leftover part of the communist revolution that took over. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3292.4799999999996s)]
*  It's the one piece they weren't able to take over. I would be careful. I would also try to work on [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3298.4799999999996s)]
*  more broadly having better working relations with China in a way that allows you again to build that [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3306.96s)]
*  deterrent a little bit, but signaling to the Chinese at the same time, look, we are never [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3313.36s)]
*  going to provoke anything. We're never going to recognize Taiwan independence. I think Jake [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3317.84s)]
*  Sullivan put it very well. He said the Taiwan situation, I think this is on my show, that it's [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3324.32s)]
*  always been illogical and contradictory, but all that weird and illogical and contradictory stuff [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3329.76s)]
*  has held peace since 1949. Let's just try and particularly since the Shanghai communique, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3335.92s)]
*  let's just try to keep it going. Sometimes you can't solve these problems. Let's just keep the [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3344.32s)]
*  peace. Oh yeah. No, I totally agree with you. I mean, on this one, I think we're very aligned. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3349.36s)]
*  Solving the problem isn't the goal here. It's avoiding the status quo as weird as it is, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3355.76s)]
*  is great. I think in addition, I think they've been good at not just the messaging, but [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3360.48s)]
*  the slight turn in the weapons provided instead of just giving them big showy weapons that are [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3366.4s)]
*  kind of useless in a contingency, like new ships or new planes, giving them the things that they [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3372.08s)]
*  actually need to defend themselves. Anti-tank weapons, anti-ship weapons, smaller arms, [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3377.28s)]
*  frankly, the stuff that the Ukrainians have used. The so-called occupying strategy, which I think [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3383.6s)]
*  is exactly right. Yeah. So it's actual deterrence and not just kind of an arms sales for the sake [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3387.84s)]
*  of arms sales. Well, look, this history turn that we took is a great way of working into your book [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3392.72s)]
*  here. And as someone who wrote on the subject of the rise of kind of populist autocracy, [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3399.9199999999996s)]
*  I think one thing's been missing from a lot of the writing about this and commentary about this [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3406.16s)]
*  rise of populism and ethnonationalism and autocracy is the historical context. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3411.04s)]
*  And this is one of the things that this year new book does so incredibly well. So you take this [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3417.52s)]
*  sweeping look at past revolutions, particularly things like the Dutch, British and French, [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3422.3999999999996s)]
*  the industrial revolutions here and in the UK. And then you kind of juxtapose that with [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3428.08s)]
*  whatever's been going on in kind of the post-Cold War period. As people who follow your commentary, [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3433.2799999999997s)]
*  what I like about your worldview for reading, I've tried to emulate as best I can, is that you work [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3442.08s)]
*  in not just politics, but the economy, technological change, issues around identity. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3447.7599999999998s)]
*  And so you kind of paint this picture. And I wanted to start by asking you [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3454.56s)]
*  kind of what motivated you to write this book, to take this entry point? And presumably you wanted [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3459.52s)]
*  to talk about the revolutions and the populism that is remaking our world today and contributed [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3464.3999999999996s)]
*  everything we just talked about. You chose to kind of enter through the doorway of these kind of [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3468.7999999999997s)]
*  mainly European revolutions of the past. What drew you to that idea? And what was it like to [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3473.76s)]
*  kind of step out of the present and look at the present from that prism of past revolution? [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3481.0400000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's a great question. In some ways, at the broadest possible level, Ben, [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3486.1600000000003s)]
*  I think you and I were motivated by very similar things. I read your last book and loved it. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3491.1200000000003s)]
*  And what you were really talking about was, look, the world seemed to be going a certain [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3496.5600000000004s)]
*  direction after 1989. And it was a direction that for people who believed in the enlightenment [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3502.0s)]
*  liberal project of the Western world and the way it was being universalized with human rights and [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3510.4s)]
*  democracy and freer markets, freer trade, freer information, this seemed like a wonderful thing. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3515.92s)]
*  And it seemed like human aspirations were being fulfilled. And then something happened. And it's [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3521.84s)]
*  gone haywire or it's at least gotten much more complicated. And there's a big backlash. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3527.04s)]
*  What is going on? So at the meta level, it was that. I began thinking about it [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3534.64s)]
*  about 10 years ago with the rise of the Tea Party, because I noticed something very bizarre. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3540.88s)]
*  The Republican Party tends to be a very hierarchical party, very top down. There's that [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3546.72s)]
*  famous line about presidential nominations that Democrats have to fall in love. You think about [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3552.0s)]
*  Clinton, Obama, Kennedy, but Republicans fall in line. They nominate the next guy on the list, [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3557.68s)]
*  Bob Dole, John McCain. This is the party that nominated Richard Nixon five times for his [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3567.44s)]
*  presidential, vice presidential ticket. So that party was being upended by an insurgency. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3574.24s)]
*  And the insurgency was very unusual in that it was not really Reagan's Republican Party. It wasn't [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3581.04s)]
*  about free trade and spreading democracy abroad and limited government. It was mostly about cultural [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3589.2s)]
*  issues. The Theodore Scotch-Pauley deal has this wonderful book about the Tea Party. She spent a [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3596.16s)]
*  year basically hanging out with them. And she says all their motivations were cultural. It was [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3601.36s)]
*  immigration. It was what we would now call the woke agenda, multiculturalism. A lot of it was [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3606.96s)]
*  the backlash of the first black family. Black president. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3613.28s)]
*  Yeah. And it's absolutely clear. Even today, Ben, I think there's something like 30% of the [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3617.2s)]
*  Republican Party says we don't believe Obama was born in America. I always have taken a way of [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3623.68s)]
*  expressing a kind of visceral cultural objection to the rise of blacks or Obama, [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3631.04s)]
*  however you want to put it. It's a kind of opposition to all this diversity, multiculturalism [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3641.68s)]
*  that's sweeping through American society. So when I started to think about it in terms of that kind [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3648.88s)]
*  of a backlash, I asked myself, well, we've had periods of great change before these great [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3656.24s)]
*  revolutions which have moved societies forward. What did the backlash look like? And how did it [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3662.72s)]
*  work? And I was fascinated when I would go back to find that even with the Dutch, who were really [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3668.48s)]
*  the beginning of modern politics, enormous technological progress, enormous economic revolution, [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3674.8799999999997s)]
*  and it produces an identity revolution. They start to think of themselves as Dutch, as Protestant, [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3683.36s)]
*  not as part of the Catholic Habsburg Empire. And there's a backlash. There develops a party that [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3688.8s)]
*  says, this is way too much change, too much, too fast. Let's go back to the old ways. We'll take [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3696.0s)]
*  you back to a simpler age. It was almost like there was a party that said, we'll make the Netherlands [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3702.6400000000003s)]
*  great again, which has always been the politics of nostalgia. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3709.04s)]
*  It's the oldest form of politics out there. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3714.3199999999997s)]
*  And it turns out it's very, and it gets heightened when you have a lot of progressive change. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3717.6s)]
*  What was interesting to me about that, that you seem to kind of be particularly drawn by the Dutch [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3724.08s)]
*  revolution, but then also how it fed into the glorious revolution in England with William of [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3729.44s)]
*  Orange, it seemed to me part of what you admired about how that was managed, unlike say the French [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3735.6s)]
*  revolution where they burned it all down and then Napoleon rampaged across Europe, is that [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3744.4s)]
*  there was this kind of bottom-up demand for change, but it kind of was captured by [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3750.96s)]
*  reform of political institutions. So it's kind of what we would think of as a more conservative [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3759.36s)]
*  revolution. So it was like an incremental embrace of pluralism, reform. I mean, right now it seems [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3764.4s)]
*  like we're caught in between a kind of burn it down right-wing nationalism and a far, like a left [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3772.56s)]
*  wing that hasn't kind of figured out how to win the populist fight. And then like social Democrats [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3782.88s)]
*  who are in this kind of very strange place of like defending institutions that they used to criticize, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3788.8s)]
*  like the CIA and the military industrial complexes now. I mean, what did you take from that? [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3793.6s)]
*  Because I could feel your affinity for kind of the William of Orange character. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3800.48s)]
*  What can we learn about a different model of revolution than MAGA or communism essentially? [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3806.8s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, either you look, you're asking the central question is how do you navigate through [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3813.04s)]
*  this or these kinds of periods of revolution? And it feels like the ones that have done it the best [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3816.56s)]
*  and by best, I mean, the ones who've been able to do it in a way where the change, [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3822.4s)]
*  the progressive change that we all want endures are the ones who have tended to be incremental, [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3826.7200000000003s)]
*  the ones who have recognized that societies can only take so much change so fast, who've been [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3832.7200000000003s)]
*  willing to take a half loaf or even a quarter loaf rather than the full loaf. And I think that for [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3839.12s)]
*  people who generally are of that inclination, my feeling is always just be understanding. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3845.12s)]
*  Take for example, immigration as an immigrant. The US in 1975 was 4.5% foreign born. It's today [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3853.12s)]
*  15% foreign born. Look, I think that's a wonderful thing. It's enriched America in a hundred different [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3860.96s)]
*  ways, but it's a lot of change, particularly for people who have lived in a very monocultural [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3866.7999999999997s)]
*  kind of atmosphere in a town or community. So just be understanding, try to persuade, [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3874.64s)]
*  don't shame people, don't make it feel like they're somehow morally inferior if they don't [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3882.0s)]
*  understand what you understand. Similarly on some of these gender issues. I mean, look, I think [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3886.96s)]
*  people like Clinton and Obama practice that politics. I know that it's now very unpopular [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3893.7599999999998s)]
*  to say or it's a sign of supposedly Obama's kind of retrograde politics that he initially was in [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3901.52s)]
*  favor of civil unions, but not gay marriage. But that's a perfect example of a politician [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3908.3999999999996s)]
*  trying to make sure he's not too far ahead of his country. He's not too far. There was a wonderful [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3914.48s)]
*  line that Franklin Roosevelt has where he says, there is a terrible thing to be a leader and to [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3921.7599999999998s)]
*  turn around and to notice that there is no one following you. You can only lead if you have, [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3928.32s)]
*  if you figured out the positions that you have that have enough of a following that it will then [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3934.88s)]
*  lead to enduring change. And I think on the left, that tends to be sometimes a search for purity [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3940.7200000000003s)]
*  and an impatience with that process. And I would just say, look, the goal here is to make these [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3947.2000000000003s)]
*  changes endure, not to get a momentary victory. Yeah, there was another great Roosevelt line [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3952.64s)]
*  that Obama used to quote to me all the time about this, the interplay between politicians [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3959.12s)]
*  and public opinion, where he was meeting with Randolph, the great head of the Black Porters [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3964.0s)]
*  Union, who ended up being the leader of the March on Washington in 1963. And Randolph had a bunch of [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3969.12s)]
*  demands for FDR and he said, I agree with all those demands now, go make me do it. And he did, [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3975.3599999999997s)]
*  actually. He pressured him to make some big changes. Well, I want to make sure I also ask [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3981.04s)]
*  you though, Friede, in the second half of the book where you're dealing with, it's a great survey of [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3985.04s)]
*  the changes that are happening now in the economy, in technology, in identity politics. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3990.0s)]
*  But you also obviously given your perspective and for this audience, geopolitics is a part of this. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=3997.92s)]
*  And part of what's so unsettling to me, frankly, and interesting in reading your book [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4004.32s)]
*  and how you kind of weave these threads together is we are somehow simultaneously in this country [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4008.8s)]
*  going to have to figure out how to not lose our democracy and how to not end up in World War III. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4014.8s)]
*  And those are somehow related, but they're also somewhat distinct. And it comes back a bit to the [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4025.1200000000003s)]
*  China piece. But one of the things that worries me is that, and you interview a lot of people on [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4033.04s)]
*  your show, right? Including Democrats, including people who I might agree with on almost a lot of [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4039.84s)]
*  the individual issues, but it's kind of a mindset of American primacy. And you were ahead of the [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4046.08s)]
*  curve on anticipating a multipolar world. Look, I don't like a lot of things Xi Jinping does, but [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4051.92s)]
*  you argue in the book for kind of finding a way of coexistence with China and finding ways to [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4059.2799999999997s)]
*  form kind of obviously partnerships of shared interests around things like climate change [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4063.92s)]
*  and technology that we're going to have to do. Coming out of this process, how did you look at [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4069.12s)]
*  the ways in which we can reconcile both the need to manage the revolutions in our own society [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4073.84s)]
*  with the need to kind of coexist with a different system like China in the world? [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4079.2799999999997s)]
*  You know, I came out of, in doing the research for this, I came out of it a little more pessimistic [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4084.08s)]
*  on that front. You and I shared the perspective entirely on where we'd like to see the kind of [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4090.48s)]
*  sweet spot of American foreign policy, which is, you know, find a way to cooperate with China [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4097.92s)]
*  where you can. Of course, there's going to be a lot of competition. Of course, there's going to be [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4103.28s)]
*  a lot of tension. But, you know, let's try to not have a situation where the two largest economies [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4107.12s)]
*  in the world are, you know, are moving in just one direction, which is toward greater and greater [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4112.48s)]
*  tension because particularly given Taiwan, that could easily lead to a great power war that we've [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4118.719999999999s)]
*  avoided for 75 years. The trouble is what I discovered is that for Xi Jinping and Putin, [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4125.04s)]
*  it's not just that they're balancing against American power in a simple, cold, calculated, [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4133.919999999999s)]
*  rational way. They are also balancing against American liberal ideas. Xi is very much a [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4139.6s)]
*  cultural conservative. He believes that the greatest danger to the Chinese Communist Party [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4148.160000000001s)]
*  is to be infected by all these Western, for China to be infected by all these Western ideas about [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4153.68s)]
*  openness and individual rights and individual autonomy. And so he has been launching a campaign [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4159.84s)]
*  of basically saying, you know, we don't want this. We are a different society. Putin, of course, [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4166.96s)]
*  has done it even more dramatically with the embrace of the Orthodox Church and, you know, denouncing [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4172.88s)]
*  gender rights in the U.S. But what I came to realize is that these guys are not just balancing [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4179.52s)]
*  against American hard power. They're balancing against American soft power. So they also want, [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4183.92s)]
*  you know, in an odd way for their domestic politics, this idea of oppositionalism toward America [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4190.400000000001s)]
*  is part of their domestic ideology. It's part of what gives them a certain kind of domestic [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4198.400000000001s)]
*  credibility. So all of which means it's a little more difficult to get to, you know, kind of moments [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4203.68s)]
*  of cooperation, arenas of cooperation. So I've come to a kind of view that's a little bit [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4212.0s)]
*  less hopeful, which is, look, we are not going to, you know, we are at best going to have a [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4218.080000000001s)]
*  cold peace with China. It's, you know, what we have to avoid is a hard war and a cold war. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4224.88s)]
*  And the reason we want to avoid a hard war is obvious, but the reason we want to avoid a cold [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4231.92s)]
*  war is because it would so distort our society. It would mean America would be consumed with this. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4235.84s)]
*  It would mean an arms race with the second richest country in the world, a country of great [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4244.72s)]
*  technological sophistication. It would mean that we would end up, you know, diverting so much of [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4249.68s)]
*  the energy and attention we need to build America back, build the economy, invest in our society, [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4256.4800000000005s)]
*  build and maintain our democracy. Everything would go away and we'd be, and do we really want that? [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4263.68s)]
*  And so is there a path? And there is a path. It's a working relationship with an adversary. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4269.92s)]
*  It probably resembles détente with the Soviet Union. You know, we were in a period of intense [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4275.68s)]
*  geopolitical rivalry with the Soviet Union, but we found a way to talk to them. We found a way to [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4281.84s)]
*  stabilize things. We found a way to make sure that there were channels of communication open so that [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4286.56s)]
*  nothing happened that was a misunderstanding. Nothing happened that was kind of, you know, [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4291.68s)]
*  some kind of accidental crisis that then just exploded. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4296.88s)]
*  Well, look, Frida, I really appreciate you coming on today. People listening should definitely pick [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4300.160000000001s)]
*  up Revolutions. I mean, we've scratched the surface of such a rich, researched and obviously [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4307.280000000001s)]
*  elegantly written book. And I'm sure you're, you know, like you and I have been trying to find that [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4313.68s)]
*  sweet spot for the entire time I've known you. And it's hard not to be pessimistic, but we've [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4321.36s)]
*  gotten through some tough times before. Hopefully we can do it again. But I like how you have evolved [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4327.839999999999s)]
*  your own thinking by examining the kind of politics of countries and not just seeing foreign policy as [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4332.639999999999s)]
*  you know, a collection of foreign interests. It's an extension of domestic politics, [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4338.48s)]
*  right? For all these places. So thanks so much for coming on and thanks for writing the book. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4343.5199999999995s)]
*  It's a huge pleasure to do this with you, Ben. A long time admirer of everything you write and [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4347.68s)]
*  of this podcast. So thanks for having me. I'm very pleased to welcome to Pod Save the [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4352.88s)]
*  World the founder and CEO of Branch Media, which has got a lot of great podcasts. You should check [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4356.96s)]
*  out the Lost Debate, but we are here to talk about Killing Justice, which Branch did with [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4362.08s)]
*  Crooked Media. I've been very proud to be an executive producer, which, you know, [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4366.72s)]
*  I didn't do much work on this one, Ravi, but it's really turned out great. It's an extraordinary [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4371.4400000000005s)]
*  podcast. So congratulations and thanks for coming on. Well, thank you. And you know, [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4375.28s)]
*  you did the most important thing, which was to land us with Crooked and we're really excited [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4378.32s)]
*  to partner, you know, and to get this story out there because it's, it couldn't come at a better [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4381.759999999999s)]
*  time. Well, yeah, let's start there. I mean, I want to start with the podcast and then get into [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4386.8s)]
*  Indian politics. Just, it's kind of interesting how this is all begins with you, this whole idea [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4390.639999999999s)]
*  for this podcast, and really this whole journey of you as an Indian American who had not really [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4398.08s)]
*  dove into the politics and identity of India. Tell our listeners how this idea came to you, [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4403.52s)]
*  what the origin story of this podcast is, the murder that got your attention. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4411.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So I run this nonprofit media company called The Branch and we're small and we kind of, [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4415.4400000000005s)]
*  you only take on a few projects a year. And a couple of years ago, I got an email and like, [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4422.88s)]
*  I imagine you get these kinds of pitches all the time. I always get these emails saying, you know, [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4427.52s)]
*  let's do this podcast together. Let's do this project. And I usually ignore them, not because [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4432.24s)]
*  I want to be rude, just because you just don't have enough time to vet all these things. But [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4436.32s)]
*  one email I got that really caught my attention was basically making some pretty grand claims [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4440.24s)]
*  about this death of a judge in India that they said was really suspicious and that landed at [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4444.96s)]
*  the doorstep of Modi and his right-hand man, a guy named Amit Shah, who's the current home minister. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4449.76s)]
*  And many people speculate potential successor to Modi, basically saying these guys are potentially [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4455.599999999999s)]
*  implicated in the death of this judge. And I was like, whoa, that's serious. So I started vetting [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4460.72s)]
*  it and it was kind of an unlikely project because although my name is Ravi Gupta, I was raised by my [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4466.16s)]
*  mom who's Polish-American in India. My dad who's Indian left us when I was a kid. And so I went up [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4472.72s)]
*  tackling this project both to try to get to the bottom of the story of what happened to this judge, [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4480.0s)]
*  but also as an excuse to go to India for the first time and explore this part of my identity. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4486.400000000001s)]
*  I have a fully Indian name and I have 50% of my DNA from India, but know a lot less about the [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4492.8s)]
*  country than I should. And so that has been the journey I've been on for the past year. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4499.92s)]
*  05.00 Well, I mean, that makes you in a way the kind of perfect guide, [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4503.84s)]
*  right, for people who are kind of just coming to this like you are. One of the things I love [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4506.72s)]
*  about the podcast, which again, everybody should check out Killing Justice, is you kind of set out [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4511.2s)]
*  to answer this question of what happened with the potential murder of this judge and is there a [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4516.72s)]
*  connection to Amit Shah and we'll get into Amit Shah a little bit. But for people, just think of [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4522.8s)]
*  Amit Shah as if you combined, you know, Steve Bannon, Stephen Miller, Mitch McConnell, all into [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4528.4s)]
*  one guy. I mean, this is really Modi's right-hand man almost barely begins to describe it. So this [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4533.44s)]
*  is a huge allegation. And you've got an investigative journalist and people listening to this podcast [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4539.36s)]
*  know that it's hard to be an investigative journalist in India these days. And what's [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4544.639999999999s)]
*  interesting to me about it is you go to find the answer to that question, and it leads like all good [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4548.719999999999s)]
*  reporting to just more and more questions. And it's hard to get people to talk kind of on the record [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4554.0s)]
*  about what happened, which kind of tells its own story. But as you're going on this journey, [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4559.5199999999995s)]
*  you're learning about yourself, you're learning about Indian identity, you're learning about [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4565.04s)]
*  Indian politics. How did the project change in the course of you reporting it and traveling to [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4569.44s)]
*  India and following up with sources? Yeah, it's really fascinating because there's the personal [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4575.68s)]
*  side of things. So from the moment I get off the airplane in Mumbai, people are correcting me on [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4581.5199999999995s)]
*  the way I'm pronouncing my own name, right? So from the beginning, it is just a jarring experience. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4586.08s)]
*  And if you've ever been to Mumbai, I imagine you might have. It is outside of my personal experience, [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4591.6s)]
*  Mumbai is like nothing I've ever seen. It's crazy. So all the personal stuff, which we can get to is [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4596.400000000001s)]
*  it was incredibly rewarding. But then on the question of this mystery, there's two parts of it. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4603.76s)]
*  There's like the actual threads of what happened to this judge. And I learned a lot more that it [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4611.200000000001s)]
*  wasn't just about this particular case that this judge was hearing, which was basically Amit Shah, [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4616.64s)]
*  who's the current home minister was accused of murder. It went all the way back to the Gujarat [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4622.320000000001s)]
*  riots in 2002, where the guy that was allegedly murdered was also alleged to be central to the [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4627.68s)]
*  riot story, which I learned throughout the course of this reporting, which actually I thought this [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4638.320000000001s)]
*  was an interesting story to begin with. But then I realized, oh, why is this a case that civil society [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4642.24s)]
*  in India is so up in arms about? Oh, because it potentially leads all the way back to the most [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4648.08s)]
*  inconvenient thing about Modi that exists, right? So that in and of itself was interesting. But then [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4652.8s)]
*  I think at the end of it, right, the show is called Killing Justice, right? We were trying to find out [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4659.84s)]
*  what happened to this judge. But I think really, it has a double meaning as the show goes on, [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4663.5199999999995s)]
*  because it's really about the death of justice period in India, right? People waiting a decade [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4670.16s)]
*  to get a trial. People who can't, you know, reporters who can't report simple stories without [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4674.48s)]
*  threat of harassment and jail time. You know, opposition leaders being jailed. Like, you know, [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4679.68s)]
*  as we speak right now, the one of the leading opposition figures, who's the chief minister of [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4684.08s)]
*  Delhi, was just arrested not too long ago, and basically is having to campaign going back and [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4688.24s)]
*  forth to jail. Like, these are the types of things that should happen in Russia, not India, the world's [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4694.0s)]
*  alleged largest democracy. And so much of the story kind of leads us there too, right? We really [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4699.68s)]
*  spend a lot of time with what happened to this judge, but we also spend a lot of time saying, [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4707.04s)]
*  well, what happened to India? You know, is this even a democracy anymore? [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4710.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, what's so interesting to me in listening to it is that, you know, there's [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4713.68s)]
*  multiple kind of overlapping potential crimes. And one leads to the other. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4717.92s)]
*  So many. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4724.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4725.4400000000005s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4726.0s)]
*  It's passing, right? [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4726.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4727.52s)]
*  And, you know, and you can't, there's so much effort to just obstruct any effort to get to the [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4728.16s)]
*  truth. And this is the Killing Justice title. That it's like, there's the one thing that's clear, [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4736.48s)]
*  it's kind of a true crime podcast where you keep bumping into the obstruction crime, right? But you [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4740.96s)]
*  just get the sense that there's this iceberg, and these crimes are like the piece of the iceberg [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4748.72s)]
*  that is sticking up above the water. And underneath it is this whole rise of Hindu [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4754.16s)]
*  nationalism and the Gujarat riots, you know, which killed over 1000 Muslims when Modi was governor of [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4758.8s)]
*  Gujarat is kind of like an origin, not an origin story, actually, but it's a, an accelerant, I guess, [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4765.599999999999s)]
*  to the rise of Hindu nationalism is there. I really like how you brought in history too, [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4772.16s)]
*  because it's you bring in the history of the BJP, that's a Hindu nationalist political party, [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4778.8s)]
*  the RSS, which is the kind of, you know, let's face it, fascist, aligned kind of civil society [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4784.16s)]
*  organization that led into the BJP. Yeah, that's my favorite episode we did is episode three. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4790.32s)]
*  Yeah, episode three is really good. I listened to it the other day. And I mean, what did you learn? [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4795.28s)]
*  I mean, you know, like you said, you would not delve deep into your Indian or Hindu identity. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4800.48s)]
*  What did you learn as a kind of lay person about, you know, because people think Hindus, [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4808.0s)]
*  probably don't associate Hinduism with kind of violence and yes, what did you learn about this, [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4814.24s)]
*  the RSS, the BJP, the forces that created Modi and Amit Shah? Well, I think about it from the [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4819.919999999999s)]
*  perspective of, you know, the RSS is a perfect example. So the RSS is an organization that nobody [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4825.44s)]
*  like if you don't know what it is listening, it's going to sound bizarre, because it is I think it [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4830.08s)]
*  is the most under appreciated organization in the world. It has 1000s and 1000s of chapters, [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4835.2s)]
*  they have these things called chakras, which happen every evening and every morning. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4841.84s)]
*  And it is a it's like as if you took the Boys and Girls Club, the YMCA, the Boy Scouts, [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4846.88s)]
*  and the Republican Party, and then maybe the evangelical church and put them all together [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4854.32s)]
*  into one organizing organization and actually made it a paramilitary organization that trains [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4858.24s)]
*  people on how to use weapons, but also teaches them to connect with their religion. It is an [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4863.04s)]
*  incredibly powerful organization and a lot of people get the sort of relationship between the [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4869.2s)]
*  RSS and the BJP, which is Modi's party flipped, they think that the RSS is some kind of subsidiary [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4874.0s)]
*  to the BJP, whereas the RSS is the organization, the BJP is subsidiary to it, for the most part, [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4880.32s)]
*  that might be changing recently, but by and large, that's how it goes. A member of the RSS [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4887.5199999999995s)]
*  allegedly assassinated Gandhi. So this thing goes all the way back to the origins of the country. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4893.44s)]
*  And you would think based on that history, right, that okay, this is an organization that [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4897.76s)]
*  would be a pariah, given what we know about Gandhi and how central it is to the country. But [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4901.92s)]
*  Modi is a not only a former member or current member, because you know, it's one of those things [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4906.08s)]
*  that he basically wants a member, always a member. He was a member of the RSS, but he was also an [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4910.400000000001s)]
*  organizer of the RSS. So he was actually like a very central figure in the RSS, as was Amit Shah. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4914.24s)]
*  So this is an organization that is at the heart of the story. And so much of what we were trying to [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4919.280000000001s)]
*  figure out in the story was, is a conspiracy possible, right? I was thinking about Navalny [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4923.84s)]
*  a lot when we were doing this, and this was before Navalny died, but about how Navalny would always [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4929.68s)]
*  talk about like, basically, the conspiracists don't have to be as competent as you think they are, [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4934.32s)]
*  right? There's a really good part of his documentary, he kind of talks about how [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4939.84s)]
*  incompetent they could actually be. And they also could be everywhere. And that actually doesn't [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4942.96s)]
*  make you sound crazy to say that there's like the possibility of a sweeping conspiracy. And [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4948.24s)]
*  so many roads led back to this RSS organization. And they gave me tons of access, which was actually [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4952.8s)]
*  pretty wild about the story. They basically opened the doors to me. Well, yeah, I mean, [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4959.28s)]
*  when you're feeling confident, I guess, you tell your story. It was the confidence, but also my [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4962.88s)]
*  name. You talked about like, why I was the perfect guy. It's like they heard this name, Ravi Gupta, [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4969.92s)]
*  like a very Hindu name. And they're obsessed with caste, even though they pretend they're not. And [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4974.320000000001s)]
*  my caste is like a merchant class. It's kind of like a middle caste. Yeah, that means something [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4980.0s)]
*  to them. I didn't know any of this, by the way. Like they're telling me this, you know, as I'm [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4986.0s)]
*  going through India. So what's interesting is, you know, you and I know each other from Obama days, [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4990.48s)]
*  kept in touch. So obviously, you've been involved in the rise in observing the rise of the right [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=4996.16s)]
*  wing or far right here in the US, with Trump, well, Tea Party, Trump, MAGA. There are obvious [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5001.52s)]
*  parallels and then there are obvious differences between Trump and the kind of white nationalist [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5009.04s)]
*  Make America Great Again movement here. And the, you know, Hindu nationalists, you know, make India [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5015.12s)]
*  great again, or Hindu again, in India, in the sense that there are authoritarian tendencies in it. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5021.92s)]
*  And there's a lot of otherization of political opponents. What did you find to be the similarities [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5030.0s)]
*  and differences between Trump and Modi and the BJP and the Republican Party? Yeah, and actually [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5035.44s)]
*  that on the RSS point is related, it's that I understand why the organization has power. And [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5039.759999999999s)]
*  this gets to why Modi has power. It is it gives people meaning. And I think this is something for [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5045.679999999999s)]
*  us on the left and the center, we have to grapple with the fact that the right wing across the world, [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5050.48s)]
*  I think, is doing a better job at handling modernity than we are in terms of giving people [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5055.5199999999995s)]
*  meaning. Like, so when I watch these kids every evening show up to the RSS meetings, which I [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5060.8s)]
*  attended, they're showing up and they have a place to go. They have people who are nurturing them, [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5065.52s)]
*  they have, you know, through the identity with their religion, they have a, they have like a [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5071.4400000000005s)]
*  story and a real purpose, right. And I think sometimes the left and this is certainly true [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5077.360000000001s)]
*  in India, doesn't have a counterweight to that, right. We don't have this, like a coherent story [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5083.04s)]
*  that we're telling, which we could get to in terms of the problems with the left in India. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5087.28s)]
*  But Modi is, is like, if this were like a Terminator analogy, he's like the T 1000 from [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5090.8s)]
*  Terminator two, like he has a different, much more powerful version of populism than Trump ever could [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5097.04s)]
*  be. He is more popular. He is he is the real deal in terms of his connection to everything he says, [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5102.4800000000005s)]
*  right, he believes it, where I have serious questions about what Trump believes or doesn't [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5109.4400000000005s)]
*  believe. He has a very coherent ideology. He's extremely disciplined. You talk to people who are [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5113.92s)]
*  in Modi's camp, he'll sit through six hours of meetings and not go to the bathroom. He's just [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5118.48s)]
*  like on it. He truly grew up poor, and talks about it in a way that like the most effective populists [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5122.4s)]
*  can more but most importantly, the right wing and the left, the right wing in India and the right [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5128.639999999999s)]
*  wing in the US have some marked differences. The most important is the right wing populists in India [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5135.36s)]
*  are truly populist in the sense that they have a digital welfare scheme where they're sending [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5142.24s)]
*  payments to the poor, they've expanded infrastructure. So like the mythical sort of [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5146.48s)]
*  infrastructure week that Trump has is actually a real thing in India. They also have massive [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5150.0s)]
*  spending on renewable energy. Like when I was at the RSS headquarters, they were hosting a climate [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5155.12s)]
*  conference. So it's like these are types of things that you would not see in the right wing. And [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5160.5599999999995s)]
*  because of that, I think they have more staying power. Not that you know, we're obviously going [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5165.12s)]
*  to be dealing with our right wing for the rest of our lives. But Modi, I think is much more deeply [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5168.959999999999s)]
*  entrenched and like his people are more deeply entrenched. And they're of a much different [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5174.48s)]
*  variety. I think they are just more authentic. It's not it's not to say that they're I love what [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5180.0s)]
*  they're doing. But they certainly they have a they have a coherence in a substance that I don't think [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5184.32s)]
*  our right wing in the US has. Yeah, no, I agree with that. I've been I've been doing a lot of [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5188.959999999999s)]
*  reading about India lately, you know, maybe in part because I've been listening to this podcast. And, [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5192.5599999999995s)]
*  you know, there's real grievances about not just the deep seated, you know, poverty, but, you know, [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5196.959999999999s)]
*  India has gone through a succession of humiliations and colonizations, suppression of Hindu [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5203.44s)]
*  identity, you know, for hundreds of years. And, and Nehru and Gandhi and the Congress Party, [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5210.16s)]
*  they kind of dealt with the British, and then try to channel that into a kind of a secular democracy, [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5216.0s)]
*  but clearly didn't didn't hit deep enough for people, some people and what you're describing, [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5220.799999999999s)]
*  I think is exactly right. The question I have for you is, you know, this you set out to answer the [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5228.72s)]
*  mystery of what happened in this murder, and you kind of, I think found something bigger and richer, [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5233.6s)]
*  which is a mystery of what happened in India. And, and the question is, where's it going? So [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5238.16s)]
*  we're talking now towards the end of the Indian election, Modi looks poised to win. He's been [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5243.280000000001s)]
*  particularly banging the anti Muslim drum of late. We talked about that with Raniyab recently. Yeah, [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5247.92s)]
*  where do you see this going? And, and what would you say, you know, to people in on the Indian [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5252.56s)]
*  center and left or in the Congress Party or in the opposition about, you know, as a political person, [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5260.320000000001s)]
*  like what would they also need to be doing differently going forward? Yeah, man, in some [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5267.04s)]
*  ways, it reminds me a lot of the fights that we have at home, it really is a global struggle. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5271.120000000001s)]
*  But, you know, when I think about, you know, what you mentioned, like the mystery at the heart of [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5275.76s)]
*  this case, right, it was 2014, when lawyers, this case was going through this, the courts and all [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5280.8s)]
*  the stuff that we investigate happened, it was the exact pivot point when Modi actually, and the way [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5287.76s)]
*  that the case was dealt with the dividing line was when Modi came to power. Basically, Shah looked [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5292.320000000001s)]
*  like he was going to be held accountable for this alleged murder that he was he was originally [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5297.76s)]
*  charged with. And then Modi comes to power, the impunity starts, it's this case in many ways [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5303.52s)]
*  straddles the difference between the Gandhi and pluralism of the past, and the Modi era. Now, [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5308.72s)]
*  not knowing what the election results will be, but based on what everybody seems to think, which is [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5315.04s)]
*  that the BJP will win, although there's a big question about whether they'll have to form a [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5319.92s)]
*  coalition government. There are a couple of things that are going to be notable in the future here. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5324.16s)]
*  Number one is the cost party is really a political dynasty. Nehru, his daughter Indira Gandhi, [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5327.92s)]
*  her son Rajiv Gandhi, then Sonia Gandhi, who a lot of people allege was really behind the [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5338.72s)]
*  Mohd Mohan Singh government, the last Congress Party government, and then now Rahul Gandhi. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5344.72s)]
*  It's basically 70 years of one family running the party that was basically running the country. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5348.96s)]
*  And Modi, like any good populist, grabbed onto that and was like, and like I think any good [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5354.16s)]
*  populist is going to take some truth, and then they're going to add a bunch of crazy to it, [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5360.56s)]
*  which I think is what Modi has done more effectively than anybody in the world. And the [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5365.28s)]
*  real challenge for the opposition in India is to give them less truths to deal with that you aren't [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5370.32s)]
*  speaking to. And the economists and a lot of people who are really good [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5378.32s)]
*  observers of India think this could be the last Gandhi in Rahul. And no offense to Rahul Gandhi, [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5382.4s)]
*  I have no personal negative feelings about him, but I think that the people of India [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5386.719999999999s)]
*  want new blood in the politics. And so when you think of the future, my sense is there's this [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5392.64s)]
*  India, which is an acronym coalition, which is a bunch of different parties. What I would love to [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5399.12s)]
*  see come out of this race is that no more political dynasty, let's get some new voices, maybe even new [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5403.6s)]
*  parties, right? There are some really interesting new parties like that chief minister in Delhi [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5409.68s)]
*  who are going to be able to get into politics. That could create a new narrative. Now as for Modi, [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5413.28s)]
*  unless he loses, he's going to come out emboldened. And I think there's going to be an economic [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5421.36s)]
*  message, which he's really going to push manufacturing. He has a real economic problem. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5426.0s)]
*  There's mythology about how good India's economy really is, which if we want, we could talk about. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5430.48s)]
*  But he will certainly lean more into the Hindu nationalism. And he's been alluding to big [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5436.96s)]
*  plans after the election, which we'll have to wait and see. So I think that things could get a [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5443.04s)]
*  lot worse in terms of the authoritarian bend of the country after this election. Yeah. It feels [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5447.04s)]
*  like that way. It's going to get worse for potentially it can get better. But look, I [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5452.4s)]
*  just want to congratulate you. It's such a great podcast. I love limited series podcasts, [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5458.32s)]
*  the ability to tell a story and let it breathe a little bit. So I just want to again, recommend [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y6PdjoMoz4&t=5463.12s)]
