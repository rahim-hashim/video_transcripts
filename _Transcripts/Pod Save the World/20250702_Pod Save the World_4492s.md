Video Description: Tommy Vietor and Ben Rhodes lament Trump’s travesty of a spending bill and the death of USAID, and how both will cost lives and further tank America’s global reputation. They unpack the fallout from Israel and the US’s strikes on Iran, the bizarre delusions and marginalization of Tulsi Gabbard, and the ending of Temporary Protected Status for Haitians. They also discuss Trump’s interference in Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu’s corruption trial, the latest horrors in Gaza, shocking settler violence in the West Bank, and anti-Israel speech at the UK’s Glastonbury Festival. Also covered: new fighting between Ukraine and an emboldened Russia, Trump’s shaky ceasefire and resource-grab masquerading as a “peace deal” between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, and a triumphant pride parade in Budapest. Finally, they plan a trip to the world’s next top spring break destination: Wonsan Kalma, North Korea.

# Trump’s Ridiculous Campaign for a Nobel Peace Prize
**Pod Save the World:** [July 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8)
*  Welcome back to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Ben Rhodes. As folks watching on the YouTube know Ben is currently [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=0.0s)]
*  Zooming in from some sort of hamam a sauna [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=7.0s)]
*  Maybe a banya. It does it's a nice wooden aesthetic. That's why you need to subscribe to Pod Save the World on YouTube [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=10.72s)]
*  I'm basically [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=15.98s)]
*  Zooming in from the Grand Budapest Hotel. I'm somewhere in the former Austro-Hungarian Empire and enjoying myself [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=17.580000000000002s)]
*  So yes, there is a sauna here, but I'm not in it right now, but it just looks like that [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=23.7s)]
*  You'll find a Habsburg somewhere Ben [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=28.46s)]
*  I would recommend that you maybe stay overseas and not come back because thanks to Trump and Republicans [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  17 million people in this country are gonna lose health care [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=37.14s)]
*  Our debt is going to explode because we're giving tax breaks to the richest people in the country [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=39.620000000000005s)]
*  The US government is gonna fuck over clean energy producers for absolutely no reason and no one seems to care [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=44.06s)]
*  yeah, I have to say that as [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=51.18s)]
*  Bad as things are they look even worse from outside the country because it doesn't make any sense when you're not [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=53.82s)]
*  like in the belly of that beast and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=59.82s)]
*  To your point on me like one of the things I learned [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=62.22s)]
*  In all my years in government and since is that nothing is more important to [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=65.34s)]
*  America's position in the world than what we do in America. It's not the foreign policy [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=69.98s)]
*  it's kind of what we're doing and and stacking up trillions of dollars in debt and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=74.53999999999999s)]
*  And [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=79.22s)]
*  passing bills that lead to the deaths of thousands and thousands of Americans and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=80.42s)]
*  Gutting clean energy when the Chinese are like racing ahead [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=84.94s)]
*  None of that makes a lot of sense and it makes even less sense [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=88.42s)]
*  When you're looking at it from the outside in so I don't know [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=92.38s)]
*  I I honestly I mean I can't think of a worse bill in my life than this [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=95.78s)]
*  Can you no no truly a Dan said the same thing today? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=101.22s)]
*  Yeah, China installed more wind turbines and solar panels last year than the rest of the world combined [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=103.98s)]
*  Why because they understand the climate change is a real thing? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=109.06s)]
*  But also because all of the industries of the future are insanely [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=112.16s)]
*  Energy dependent like all the AI stuff that we're talking about all like those companies aren't gonna be able to exist here in the United [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=116.34s)]
*  States if they can't get enough power and yet we're gutting tax credits for clean energy [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=123.0s)]
*  I mean until the 11th hour then [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=127.38s)]
*  Republicans wanted to slap an excise tax on solar and wind energy projects that [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=129.9s)]
*  The estimates were would have increased the cost of your energy bill for your average consumer by up to 20% [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=136.02s)]
*  Just because they wanted to do a favor for some like coal lobbyist or something [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=141.42000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean we know that they are in bed with the fossil fuel industry [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=145.38s)]
*  But the thing that gets me is it like part of this is also just the libs care about climate change [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=151.12s)]
*  So we're gonna get rid of that right, but these people I mean to just stay on the China point for a second China has spent [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=157.7s)]
*  over a decade [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=165.82s)]
*  Reorienting their entire economy around clean energy [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=167.5s)]
*  around technological inputs for AI [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=171.26s)]
*  around supply chains for critical minerals and [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=174.46s)]
*  We are [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=178.46s)]
*  Look at the same people that love to talk really tough about how they're gonna stand up the Chinese Communist Party are [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=179.66s)]
*  Literally ensuring that the United States is not only unable to compete, but we're not even like in the conversation [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=186.38s)]
*  We're moving in the opposite direction, right? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=192.82s)]
*  Never mind what this is gonna do to human beings in the United States [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=195.98s)]
*  Hard to explain to people outside the country why you would cut off food assistance [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=199.85999999999999s)]
*  Why would you would cut health care? Why are you would cut USAID? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=205.14s)]
*  Like why America seems to be in this kind of nihilistic? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=209.89999999999998s)]
*  Vengeful place and that's not a I mean, it's not a good look let's just know [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=213.57999999999998s)]
*  Hey, by the way USAID is now officially dead [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=219.38s)]
*  There was a study in the Lancet this respected medical journal that estimates that USAID saved [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=222.26s)]
*  92-million lives from 2001 until 2021 and that destroying it could kill [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=228.85999999999999s)]
*  14 million people between now and 2020 2030 [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=234.98s)]
*  4.5 million of whom will be kids under five years old. So that's what our government is doing [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=239.5s)]
*  They're passing a gigantic tax cut for the richest people on the planet and they're throwing poor people off of Medicaid at the United States [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=245.42s)]
*  And then Elon Musk who now apparently hates this fucking tax bill [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=251.66s)]
*  It couldn't see this coin coming somehow despite being you know, the smartest person in the world him and his doge guys [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=255.48s)]
*  Decided to kill off USAID which if you want to be really outraged Ben [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=261.02s)]
*  Read the Washington Post story about all the babies in Sudan who are starving to death because [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=265.21999999999997s)]
*  Elon decided to tweet we spent the weekend feeding USAID into the woodchipper could have gone to some great parties did that instead [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=271.58s)]
*  I guess the the ketamine wore off a little too quickly and he decided to kill kids abroad [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=278.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and I think what we have to focus on here for a second is that the principal experience of the United States government that [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=283.34s)]
*  Hundreds of millions if not billions of people have around the world is USAID, right? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=293.38s)]
*  If you are living in large parts of the world you are living on [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=297.5s)]
*  nutrition assistance from USAID [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=303.21999999999997s)]
*  vaccines from USAID [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=305.46s)]
*  PEPFAR program for HIV AIDS from USAID [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=308.26s)]
*  Or even just you know lifelines for journalists from USAID, right? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=311.42s)]
*  All of that has been completely cut off for no discernible reason other than the whims of Elon Musk and [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=315.5s)]
*  Donald Trump coming in and kind of wanting to stick it to people because it's not any meaningful savings in the federal budget [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=323.14000000000004s)]
*  People that work on foreign policy, right people like yours and my former colleagues [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=331.38s)]
*  Like sit around and they debate whether or not, you know [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=336.74s)]
*  The strike blew up the facility at Fordo and Iran [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=340.54s)]
*  Or what assistance we should provide to Ukraine and then we wonder [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=345.82s)]
*  Why it is that most of the world does not agree with American policy? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=350.34000000000003s)]
*  Why most of the world doesn't want to get on board with supporting Ukraine or pressuring the Iranians of their nuclear program? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=354.62s)]
*  This is fundamentally so much more important than anything else that has happened in [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=361.46000000000004s)]
*  recent years in US foreign policy [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=367.90000000000003s)]
*  There's pulling the rug out from these people in ways that are gonna cause millions of deaths including the deaths of children and [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=370.46s)]
*  Then they're looking at us from the outside in saying oh not only do these people not care about people around the world [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=377.65999999999997s)]
*  They're ripping health care away from 17 million Americans themselves. What is going on in the United States? Who is running this country, right? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=383.82s)]
*  What are the priorities of the people who are running this country? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=390.86s)]
*  and and I think we have to just level with people like one of the things we said after Trump was elected is like [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=393.26s)]
*  We can't promise you that it's always gonna be good news, but we can promise to tell you the truth [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=399.26s)]
*  When you stack up the USAID death today and this bill passing today [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=404.38s)]
*  it's a pretty good emblem of who is running this country and [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=409.36s)]
*  What kind of message we're sending to Americans in the world about our priorities and it's not good and and we [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=413.46000000000004s)]
*  Everything we're gonna be doing for the rest of our lives [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=420.82s)]
*  Is kind of climbing out of this hole that we're currently descending into? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=423.74s)]
*  Yeah, it is a not to start on a dark note, but I mean like yeah. Yeah, that's a typical light light banter [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=428.5s)]

*  Well, some some say getting rid of Tibbs was, you know reversing an atrocity anyway [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=441.78000000000003s)]

*  About the impact of US and Israeli strikes on Iran and the impact it had on Iran's nuclear program [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=451.04s)]
*  We will talk about a fascinating profile of director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard who is apparently [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=456.06s)]
*  Far more delusional than I thought possible then we'll talk about the latest news about Trump's cruel immigration policies [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=461.7s)]

*  But then he was literally up all night voting on this Republican tax cut monstrosity and had to cancel which I totally understand [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=495.46s)]
*  But rain check for him. Yeah [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=502.78s)]

*  Know but that it's well time for the tax bill. I guess big take away from that, right? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=526.98s)]
*  Yeah [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=530.94s)]
*  I got got need the tax cut big take away from that to me was when you have that many celebrities at a wedding [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=531.0600000000001s)]
*  It says to me that you don't have a lot of real friends [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=536.02s)]
*  But who am I the judge from afar? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=538.0400000000001s)]
*  So our events let's turn to the Iran because we're we're slowly learning more about the impact of the US and Israeli strikes on [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=540.0799999999999s)]
*  Iran over the past couple weeks [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=547.3199999999999s)]
*  According to Iranian state media. The official death count is [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=549.76s)]
*  935 people now, obviously we take Iranian state media with a grain of salt [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=553.0s)]
*  They also don't distinguish between military and civilian casualties [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=557.12s)]
*  But the count I just read includes 38 children in 132 women [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=560.76s)]
*  And we also just we know for a fact that entire apartment buildings were flattened when Israel targeted certain Iranian generals and scientists [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=566.04s)]
*  So there certainly were civilian casualties [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=573.32s)]
*  Iranian state media also reported that the IDF airstrike on even prison killed [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=575.32s)]
*  71 people that strike still baffles me then I mean, I guess the goal was like I guess [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=580.24s)]
*  Like somehow free the political prisoners trapped there [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=585.52s)]
*  But in practice it killed inmates it killed people in surrounding buildings [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=588.44s)]
*  It killed some relatives of inmates who were at the prison because they decided to conduct the airstrike during visiting hours for some reason [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=592.56s)]
*  Separate from that the Washington Post reported that US intelligence [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=600.0799999999999s)]
*  Intercepted communications between senior Iranian officials that who were talking about the strikes on Iran's nuclear infrastructure and [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=602.96s)]
*  Remarking that the impact wasn't as bad as they'd expected now. We don't know who these guys are [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=610.4399999999999s)]
*  We don't know how credible this intelligence was [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=616.0799999999999s)]
*  But just you know another data point as we kind of try to add all this up and learn more over time [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=618.3199999999999s)]
*  Trump's official position is still that Iran's nuclear program was totally obliterated. Most others have a more nuanced take [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=623.16s)]
*  Here is international atomic agents energy agency director [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=630.8s)]
*  General Rafael Grossi on face the nation Sunday. Here's a clip the capacities they have are there [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=634.36s)]
*  they can have [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=641.48s)]
*  You know in a matter of months, I would say [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=643.72s)]
*  A few cascades of [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=646.48s)]
*  Centrifuges spinning and producing enriched uranium or less than that [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=650.52s)]
*  But as I said [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=657.16s)]
*  Frankly speaking one cannot claim that everything has disappeared and there is nothing there [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=659.4s)]
*  It is clear that there has been severe damage, but it's not total damage [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=664.52s)]
*  First of all and secondly Iran has the capacities there industrial and technological capacities [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=669.16s)]
*  So if they so wish they will be able to start doing this [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=674.5s)]
*  Again, and here's friend of the pod Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy talking to reporters [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=679.18s)]
*  Just moments after he was briefed by the administration on the impact of the strikes [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=683.98s)]
*  What President Trump told the country is that those? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=688.7s)]
*  That Iran's nuclear capability was obliterated and it just was not obliterated as open reporting has suggested these strikes did not [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=692.34s)]
*  Destroy all of their enriched uranium it did not destroy all of their centrifuges and it certainly didn't destroy their knowledge [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=700.6400000000001s)]
*  And so it stands to reason that they can [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=707.0600000000001s)]
*  Reconstitute their nuclear program within months. And what are we gonna do? We're gonna carry out these massive [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=709.84s)]
*  100-million-dollar strikes every three or four months. No, you need a diplomatic agreement and [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=716.32s)]
*  These strikes ultimately set back those diplomatic conversations [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=722.2800000000001s)]
*  I think the most honest answer is we don't know for sure yet what the impact of the bombing campaign was that is why [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=726.08s)]
*  As gross he says over and over and over again in that interview [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=732.84s)]
*  I a EA needs access so they can do inspections so we can learn more [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=735.84s)]
*  But everyone who isn't Donald Trump seems to acknowledge that it wasn't totally obliterated [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=739.72s)]
*  That we don't know where all of Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium is and that we assume that Iran also has stockpiles of [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=744.96s)]
*  centrifuge equipment [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=752.12s)]
*  And other, you know specialized gear that will allow them to resume their nuclear activities if they want [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=753.52s)]
*  So this is again, this is so frustrating because Trump has taken a victory lap [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=759.68s)]
*  The press is reporting on these strikes as if war is a quick and easy solution to this problem [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=764.76s)]
*  When in reality, it's just the story is not finished. Yeah, I two things first [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=770.4s)]
*  I do want to come to the civilian casualty point and the point I want to make about this is that [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=775.74s)]
*  Whenever you hear BB Netanyahu talk about kind of extending a hand to the Iranian people or trying to help the Iranian people [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=780.16s)]
*  You know overthrow a regime that is bad to them [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=787.96s)]
*  That is a complete another bullshit. The only audience for that is a American audience, right? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=793.16s)]
*  the only audience for that is kind of the BB Netanyahu chorus of supporters in the US because [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=799.32s)]
*  Number one he gives those speeches in English, but number two if you actually wanted to help [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=806.88s)]
*  People who wanted to deal with the Iranian regime you wouldn't kill people in even prison with bombs [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=812.9200000000001s)]
*  You wouldn't kill civilians in apartment buildings and and frankly and we heard this from Nilo to Breezy last week [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=819.5600000000001s)]
*  But I've heard more over the last week and talking to people I've talked to some people [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=826.0s)]
*  Who have family and friends in Iran what they've said is? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=830.52s)]
*  Predictably the regime has cracked down hard on all opposition over the course of last week [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=833.88s)]
*  They've rolled up people the gains that the women like freedom movement had made including women walking around with that their hair covered [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=839.5600000000001s)]
*  Those are at risk. So put aside any of the sanctimony about how we're coming to the aid of the Iranian people [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=847.16s)]
*  This basically guaranteed a crackdown on the Iranian people by this regime [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=854.96s)]
*  Second thing is on the nuclear program we have to call what Trump said for what it is. It's a lie [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=859.2s)]
*  It's a complete and utter bullshit lie that this program was obliterated. I don't know exactly the state of the program [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=864.56s)]
*  I do know it was not obliterated Donald Trump is not deep underground in Fordo able to see what happened to that facility [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=870.92s)]
*  He's not able to see what barrels of highly in maturing you might have been moved someplace else [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=877.52s)]
*  He's not able to see what scientific capacity still persists in Iran [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=883.12s)]
*  He's not able to see what the uranium supply chain is in Iran [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=888.08s)]
*  He's lying to you right and the US media reports it as a well Trump says it's obliterated and some other people said it's not [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=891.64s)]
*  It has not been obliterated and we did this assessment back in the Obama years [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=898.48s)]
*  This is open source that even if you had a much more successful bombing campaign than even this one, right? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=903.72s)]
*  One there was more than one day [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=910.2800000000001s)]
*  The most you could set back that program by bombing it is about a year and I don't even think Trump did that [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=912.24s)]
*  Now we won't know what the US intelligence assessment is for weeks or months because you have to gather [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=919.24s)]
*  Everything you have in your toolkit to figure out, you know what you can put together here because there are no inspectors on the ground [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=924.76s)]
*  But we can't trust what the Trump intelligence community tells us anymore because we've seen him as we talked about on this pod before [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=930.84s)]
*  We've seen him demand the intelligence community given the answer you once [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=938.2800000000001s)]
*  So the long and short of this thing is we don't know the damage it was done [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=941.86s)]
*  Probably it set back this program by like a few months [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=946.46s)]
*  It may have incentivized the Iranians to go underground [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=948.94s)]
*  Try to develop a crude nuclear device with the enrich uranium they have with the centrifuges they have with the knowledge that they have [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=952.0600000000001s)]
*  Look if Trump can steer this into some diplomatic solution that gets inspectors on the ground and gets [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=958.3s)]
*  Verifiable limitations on the Iranian nuclear program. That's a different conversation [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=964.94s)]
*  All we know now is that this killed a lot of people it [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=968.7399999999999s)]
*  like [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=972.54s)]
*  Empowered the worst aspects of the regime that is cracking down and it didn't deal with the nuclear program in a comprehensive way that diplomacy can do [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=973.5799999999999s)]
*  And and that's just the reality of this thing [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=980.8599999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=983.3s)]
*  And Trump keeps saying that Iran is exhausted and they don't even want to think about trying to reconstitute their nuclear program [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=983.54s)]
*  That is a view that is not shared by anyone else including his biggest cheerleaders people like Lindsey Graham who was like [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=990.02s)]
*  Oh, I know this story isn't over. I know they'll keep going after it [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=996.14s)]
*  You know Netanyahu is not suggesting that Iran is ready to give up its nuclear programs like that piece of you know [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=999.0s)]
*  He's talking about this like he's permanently solved the problem, which is just utter nonsense [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1004.42s)]
*  But then I mean speaking of demanding intelligence match Trump's personal views or you know political needs [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1008.22s)]
*  An interesting subplot that came out of this Iran debate has been the complete and total marginalization of Tulsi Gabbard [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1015.62s)]
*  Trump's director of national intelligence who came into the administration as arguably its most high-profile [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1021.34s)]
*  Anti-war voice now the Atlantic had a fascinating story last week about how Tulsi is now on the outs with Trump who is [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1028.98s)]
*  Even mused about eliminating the DNI position entirely, but then maybe the most shocking part of this story [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1035.78s)]
*  Is that yeah, we all knew Tulsi was a weirdo, but she's a political survivor [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1041.3799999999999s)]
*  You know like someone who's figured out a way to become a cabinet secretary from backbench and Democratic Congress [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1045.58s)]
*  Person like that's an impressive [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1051.14s)]
*  You know political path [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1052.8600000000001s)]
*  But she apparently has muse to people that she thinks the DNI position could be a stepping stone to another presidential campaign [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1053.9s)]
*  Which is just like absolutely delusional [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1061.22s)]
*  I've never heard anyone suggest that this job is a stepping stone like that a couple other highlights from this story been an anonymous Trump [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1064.0600000000002s)]
*  ally [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1070.3000000000002s)]
*  Said Gabbard was quote a non-player and that they want to call someone to influence Trump. They don't even think of her. It's rough [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1071.46s)]
*  That talked about that bizarre [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1078.4s)]
*  Strange to camera nuclear annihilation video that we played on the show a couple weeks back [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1081.0800000000002s)]
*  Which we still haven't really had explained to us, but it talked about how Trump basically yelled at her in the Oval Office [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1086.0800000000002s)]
*  And then a former deputy director the CIA in the early 2000s John McLaughlin said Gabbard is weaponizing intelligence in the name of combating [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1091.16s)]
*  weaponization [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1098.48s)]
*  Which is something we've also talked about here [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1100.0s)]
*  So a lot of folks are noticing just how much she's kind of sold her soul [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1101.8s)]
*  So Ben, I mean again like this administration is chock full of people who sold their souls look at JD Vance who [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1105.06s)]
*  You know ran about you know fighting for me mom and PPA and in 2017 [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1111.06s)]
*  Attacked efforts in Congress to rip health care away from people through Medicaid cuts and now calls taking insurance away from millions of people [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1115.98s)]
*  Immaterial that was his tweet today [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1123.9s)]
*  but Tulsi is up there because it really did seem like [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1125.38s)]
*  That the one thing she really [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1128.82s)]
*  Sincerely cared about was keeping the United States out of wars in the Middle East and now she is part of this propaganda effort [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1131.3400000000001s)]
*  That made it happen in Iran. Yeah, that's right. And I think look [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1137.94s)]
*  Beyond it's kind of funny to think of the DNI as a stepping stone to the presidency [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1143.26s)]
*  I mean it'll only be pretty hardcore world those who are familiar with like Jim Clapper and John Negroponte [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1147.26s)]
*  And [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1154.58s)]
*  People in the world [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1157.06s)]
*  Even our good friend Avril Haynes who would never claim that she's gonna be president states [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1158.4199999999998s)]
*  I'm not exactly stepping ever want to try yeah, right put aside the fact that it's a pretty important job, right? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1162.6599999999999s)]
*  The reason was created was to coordinate the entire intelligence community all these various agencies all their budgets all their information [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1168.3s)]
*  Connecting the dots remember that if you're around back in the 9-11 days [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1174.9399999999998s)]
*  The DNI was there to make sure that you know [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1178.34s)]
*  If there's information in the CIA and the FBI and the NSA it doesn't get like stove-piped [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1180.98s)]
*  It gets connected so we can uncover plots and things like that. That's clearly not happening. First of all, right? [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1186.02s)]
*  But this is a really important point about the Iran thing because Trump is trying to pretend like on the one hand [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1192.74s)]
*  He quote unquote obliterated the Iranian nuclear program on the other end. It wasn't a real war [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1200.5s)]
*  It was like a quick war right because he he stopped it pretty quickly [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1204.98s)]
*  look, he he just bombed a [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1209.58s)]
*  Country of over 90 million people that the United States has not directly attacked before [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1212.94s)]
*  That's gonna have a tale that lasted generation. It may flare up again [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1218.1s)]
*  We may have to go back in there and bomb those Iranian nuclear facilities again [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1222.58s)]
*  If he keeps listening to Lindsey Graham and BB Netanyahu or the Iranians may hit back at us in six months or a year [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1225.82s)]
*  Two years or the Iranians might pop up with a nuclear weapon [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1232.38s)]
*  We cannot allow them and this is where the Democratic Party's kind of unwillingness to speak with one voice [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1235.8200000000002s)]
*  Against these strikes is a really dumb mistake [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1241.7s)]
*  We cannot allow him to act like he didn't just do what he just did [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1244.38s)]
*  All these people like Tulsi Gabbard and all these MAGA people that say that they're against forever wars [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1248.8200000000002s)]
*  We're proven to be full of shit [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1254.98s)]
*  Like they did the thing that that that not even you Brock Obama and Joe Biden for all the you know [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1256.98s)]
*  Military actions they took this is the one that they restrained Israel from doing. This is one that they didn't do so [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1263.94s)]
*  Like she cannot claim any more to be this person who's against forever wars who's against [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1269.82s)]
*  You know the United States starting new wars in the Middle East [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1275.8600000000001s)]
*  She's a part of that and all of them are and we have to kind of continue to remind people that these people were lying [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1279.18s)]
*  To you about wanting to keep the United States out of conflicts in the least. Let me just add one thing [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1285.26s)]
*  I mean and also to people who are listening like what can Iran do about it? [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1290.06s)]
*  so in 2020 when Trump assassinated [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1293.82s)]
*  Kasim Soleimani the head of the IRGC the Iranians decided they were gonna try to return the favor and [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1296.54s)]
*  assassinate top American officials who were you know [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1302.54s)]
*  Associated with or kind of like driving that policy for that assassination [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1306.54s)]
*  We recently learned the Washington Post about four days ago published a report that said in 2022 [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1310.22s)]
*  The Iranians figured out what hotel in Paris that Mike Pompeo was staying at and they tried to assassinate him there and Pompeo apparently [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1317.3000000000002s)]
*  Barely escaped. We don't know all the details because obviously he doesn't want them out there for for ongoing security reasons [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1326.3000000000002s)]
*  But it does speak to their capacity [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1332.5800000000002s)]
*  And their long memories and the desire for vengeance from a country when you repeatedly kill its leaders or bomb the shit out of [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1334.6599999999999s)]
*  Its nuclear program. That's right [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1342.1799999999998s)]
*  The tail listing could be long and the only thing I was gonna add Tommy is that there are currently [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1343.6599999999999s)]
*  40,000 Americans in the Middle East service members, right? They're aircraft carriers there [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1348.5s)]
*  We have a much bigger presence there than we should otherwise have because of this Iran strike [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1354.1s)]
*  So even though we're not like in an act of war the Iranians we are spending billions of dollars we have [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1360.06s)]
*  Tens of thousands of Americans there. We have aircraft carriers there [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1367.02s)]
*  We are not pivoting to Asia or all the things that we talk about that we want to do [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1370.3s)]
*  Okay [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1374.5s)]
*  So this is still having an impact on our foreign policy and it is militarizing our foreign policy in the Middle East and is keeping [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1374.98s)]
*  Us enmeshed in the conflicts there and Tulsi Gabbard is a part of that [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1381.4s)]
*  Yeah, and it's crazy that we still have 40,000 US troops in the Middle East [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1384.92s)]
*  Start winding down some of those missions. Um, Ben while we're talking about sort of Trump policy [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1389.1s)]
*  We should just quickly point out that the Trump administration just ended temporary protected status for about 500,000 Haitians in the United States [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1393.4599999999998s)]
*  These are people who deportations could start as soon as September 2nd [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1401.58s)]
*  So the White House is now trying to claim it is safe enough for people to return to Haiti [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1406.8999999999999s)]
*  But that is just unmitigated bullshit over 1800 people were kidnapped in Haiti and over 8,000 have been killed since March of last year [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1412.9s)]
*  Due to this ongoing gang violence gangs and armed groups control 85% of Port-au-Prince the capital city [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1420.8600000000001s)]
*  Government services and security is just all but collapsed [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1427.7s)]
*  But again, this is part of this policy this immigration policy from you know, Stephen Miller [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1431.18s)]
*  Which is basically treat any migrant in the cruelest most inhumane way possible [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1436.22s)]
*  In an effort to scare others and that includes sending people to some of the most dangerous countries in the world [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1442.12s)]
*  Which in this case is Haiti [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1447.6399999999999s)]
*  But in other cases they're talking about sending people to places like Libya or South Sudan [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1448.56s)]
*  Even if they are not from there don't know the language have no ties have no way to survive [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1452.9199999999998s)]
*  It's just it's some truly evil stuff [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1457.56s)]
*  Yeah [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1460.28s)]
*  I mean first thing is that these people are here legally right temporary protected status means that you're here with a legal status in the United States [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1460.8s)]
*  But Tommy my question for you is what do you think is more dangerous? [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1467.52s)]
*  Right to be from Port-au-Prince where you have like this immense violence and complete breakdown of governance [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1471.6s)]
*  Or to be a white South African farmer. Yeah, right. I mean, you know, I mean that tells you that gives away the game, right? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1479.1599999999999s)]
*  That gives away the whole game. Yes, that's absolutely right. It's um [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1485.6s)]

*  Complimentary items that built partners and unique experiences that only members can access and now built announced that you can redeem those points [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1528.9s)]

*  All right, Ben, so let's pivot back to the Middle East much like this White House is doing [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1618.54s)]
*  So because Washington is like a magnet for the shitties people in the world Israeli Prime Minister [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1623.38s)]
*  Bibi Netanyahu is heading there on Monday, July 7th to meet with Trump again [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1627.46s)]
*  I'm sure it'll be a very subtle victory lap about Iran there [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1631.9s)]
*  We'll also probably talk about expanding the Abraham Accords Middle East peace whatever else in the lead-up to that meeting though [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1635.7s)]
*  Trump has decided to take up the cause of interfering in Netanyahu's various corruption trials [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1641.5800000000002s)]
*  Here is a message. He posted on truth social over the weekend. It is this is a quote [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1647.78s)]
*  It is terrible what they're doing in Israel to be Bibi Netanyahu [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1652.28s)]
*  How is it possible that the Prime Minister of Israel can be forced to sit in a courtroom all day long over nothing? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1654.66s)]
*  cigars Bugs Bunny doll, etc [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1660.06s)]
*  It is a political witch hunt very similar to the witch hunt that I was forced to endure the United States of America [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1662.06s)]
*  Spends billions of dollars a year far more than on any other nation protecting and supporting Israel [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1666.98s)]
*  We are not gonna stand for this. So it does sound like he's now conditioning military aid on Netanyahu [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1672.1s)]
*  Getting off for these various corruption charges for those who don't know what he's talking about [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1677.94s)]
*  Netanyahu has been on trial since around 2020 for all kinds of different [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1681.8999999999999s)]
*  Corruption instances it includes taking hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of gifts [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1686.62s)]
*  Including champagne and cigars in exchange for political favors. He is accused of offering to harm this one [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1691.7s)]
*  Israeli news publication in exchange for favorable coverage from its rival publication [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1699.02s)]
*  He's accused of offering to help a telecom company with some sort of regulatory relief in exchange for good press coverage [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1704.48s)]
*  The owner of the telecom company company owns some news outlet and basically that that was the deal like I'll help out your [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1711.66s)]
*  Your phone company if you give me good press in your news outlet. So [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1717.6200000000001s)]
*  Netanyahu's goal here just been delayed delayed delayed these trials. He often asked to lay proceedings for national security reasons [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1722.22s)]
*  Surprise surprise that delay was granted after Trump's tweet [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1729.8200000000002s)]
*  So then I guess just stepping back like I am very used to [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1733.18s)]
*  After many many years of Trump watching the worst people in politics win and get away with terrible things [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1737.8600000000001s)]
*  But like if Trump somehow manages to get Netanyahu a pardon via truth social [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1744.14s)]
*  I'm not sure I can do I can do this anymore. Like I think I might just like just [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1750.02s)]
*  Get call it a day. Yeah, I mean [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1755.34s)]
*  The funny thing is it like you get these impressions that Trump doesn't really like now, right? [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1758.26s)]
*  Like he's dropping f-bombs telling Israeli pilots a turn on the air and he's like frustrated [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1763.72s)]
*  But this kind of you know gives away the game right because what he does like is corrupt autocrats like himself [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1769.16s)]
*  You know like Trump [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1775.64s)]
*  I mean whether by the way, whether it's BB Nia or Eric Adams in New York City, right? Like if you have been [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1777.48s)]
*  guilty of crimes [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1783.96s)]
*  And you're have autocratic tendencies Trump's gonna come to your defense [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1785.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah sympathy for them none for the Haitian people who are being massacred in Port-au-Prince or the people of Gaza or the people of Iran [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1789.46s)]
*  I mean, that's the thing is is like the timing of this Iran strike, right? [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1796.26s)]
*  Was not as we've talked about because of any imminent threat from the Iranian nuclear program [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1800.54s)]
*  It's been pretty clear to and this is what a lot of Israeli political observers who still have some impartiality [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1805.74s)]
*  will say is that Netanyahu has been perpetuating both the war in Gaza and [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1812.82s)]
*  Escalating the war in Lebanon war in Iran in part because it guarantees his political survival [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1817.82s)]
*  It keeps his coalition together keeps him in power if he's not in power like Trump. He could go to prison, right? [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1823.82s)]
*  Well, that's the kind of thing that appeals to Trump [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1830.34s)]
*  So here you have Trump like literally interfering in the Israeli [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1832.6000000000001s)]
*  Political process to put the thumb on the scale for BB because he doesn't like to see an autocrat held accountable for his crimes [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1836.54s)]
*  Just like he didn't want to be held accountable for his crimes [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1842.94s)]
*  The two things that BB Nanyo and Donald Trump have in common is that they're autocrats and if they weren't in power [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1845.02s)]
*  They'd be in prison, right? [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1850.74s)]
*  And and that's the basis of this entire alliance here and you know, BB is gonna fly over to the US [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1852.18s)]
*  He'll do a huge victory lap in Iran. He'll echo Trump's claims that the program is obliterated [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1858.1s)]
*  He'll act like this was you know, Winston Churchill 2.0 when they don't have any evidence to back that up [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1864.22s)]
*  The only other thing I'd say is that this idea that it's just cigars [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1869.9s)]
*  I mean you made this point. Yes, there are a lot of gifts including Todrick gifts like cigars [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1873.36s)]
*  It was also the corruption of the entire Israeli political process being on things like media licenses, right? [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1877.9199999999998s)]
*  So this was about someone weaponizing power to not only enrich themselves like Trump does but to like, you know [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1884.1999999999998s)]
*  Intimidate the media like Trump does as well [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1891.36s)]
*  So these are people following the same playbook and they want to give each other immunity for pursuing that autocratic playbook [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1893.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1899.34s)]
*  So let's talk about Gaza because presumably it will be a conversation when they get together [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1900.8799999999999s)]
*  But Trump's statements about Gaza lately have been completely divorced from reality [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1906.1599999999999s)]
*  He told reporters that there could be a ceasefire in about a week. That seems nuts [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1911.1999999999998s)]
*  I mean Gaza has faced some of the heaviest Israeli bombardment since the war started in recent days and the New York Times reported that there's [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1915.48s)]
*  Been no progress on ceasefire talks on Sunday. The IDF announced one of the largest evacuation orders since the war started back up in March [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1922.76s)]
*  There were massive strikes in that area since including one on a beachside cafe in Gaza City that killed over 40 people and according to CNN [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1929.68s)]
*  This cafe was a well-known spot for students journalists and remote workers [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1937.28s)]
*  I don't know if you've seen the images from this strike Ben [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1942.22s)]
*  fucking horrific [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1945.28s)]
*  The Guardian cites Israeli officials who say that this seized territory in northern Gaza is meant to act as a bargaining chip in [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1947.0s)]
*  negotiations with Hamas [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1953.76s)]
*  The IDF chief of staff seemed to signal last week that the military was close to reaching its goal [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1954.88s)]
*  That they'd set back in May of controlling 75% of the Gaza Strip [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1959.92s)]
*  And on the humanitarian front [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1964.72s)]
*  I mean the Gaza Health Foundation the GHF that Israeli US [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1966.48s)]
*  Kind of business venture that is supposed to replace the UN to do food distribution in Gaza is still just an unmitigated disaster [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1969.5200000000002s)]
*  There are still people starving to death [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1976.5600000000002s)]
*  The distribution points have become death traps for Palestinians the UN estimates that around [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1978.6399999999999s)]
*  580 people have been killed at these sites since GHF operations began harets ran a devastating expose a [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1983.9199999999998s)]
*  Quoting IDF soldiers who said they were ordered to fire on unarmed crowds of Gazans as a means of crowd control [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1991.56s)]
*  Even when those people post no threat they counted at least 19 shooting incidents at GHF sites including the use of grenades [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=1998.04s)]
*  Artillery tank shells drone strikes [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2005.76s)]
*  Haaretz also reported that the death toll in Gaza could be approaching 100,000 people which is well above the [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2008.8799999999999s)]
*  56,000 figure from the Gaza Health Ministry that you always hear derided as you know [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2015.84s)]
*  Hamas numbers just worth noting that there's now a couple pieces of more academic [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2020.36s)]
*  Literature or attempts to look at you know do studies to figure out the death toll in Gaza that find numbers that are much higher [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2027.24s)]
*  Than the Gaza Health Ministry so Ben I think the question is just stepping back like Trump [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2032.84s)]
*  He's obsessed with getting a Nobel Peace Prize, right? [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2038.36s)]
*  He will talk about you know the the DRC Congo deal [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2041.56s)]
*  That just got done that you know he thinks merits him getting one [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2046.24s)]
*  He said that you know negotiating a ceasefire between India and Pakistan should get him a Nobel Peace Prize question is [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2049.8s)]
*  Does he think a Gaza deal would warrant a peace prize? [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2056.16s)]
*  Because we don't really hear him talk about it in this context which makes me just wonder does he care does he [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2059.84s)]
*  Is that not part of the calculus because he is sadly the only person I think [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2065.76s)]
*  Who has the leverage to force Netanyahu to stop fighting, but he is still not using it [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2069.52s)]
*  Yeah, I think what was really telling is that when Trump did come out and say and drop that f-bomb and said [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2076.2400000000002s)]
*  Israel's got to cut it out turn the pilots around that we're gonna bomb Iran [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2084.84s)]
*  Israel stopped right so [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2088.92s)]
*  And by the way just so people know that we're equal opportunity critics here [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2091.7599999999998s)]
*  The same would have been true of Joe Biden Joe Biden had said you know I'm cutting you guys off if you don't stop in Gaza [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2095.7599999999998s)]
*  He is not doing anything to stop what BB Nia is doing in Gaza in fact [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2102.4s)]
*  He went along with this Potemkin [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2107.68s)]
*  You know a distribution mechanism that turns out based on how Ratz is reporting is in part [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2110.04s)]
*  Just a death trap for you know Palestinians get picked off in the inevitable [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2117.08s)]
*  Mayhem that happens when you have starving people you know choke pointed to one a distribution point right so [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2121.7599999999998s)]
*  Trump could stop this if he wanted to if he did the same thing they did on Iran and said you know cut this out [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2128.96s)]
*  I'm cutting you guys off if you don't stop it. He's not doing that. He's just not doing that and [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2134.64s)]
*  Clearly he doesn't see any humanity in the people in Gaza right like he [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2140.08s)]
*  He's only plan for Gaza that he's ever articulated [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2145.4s)]
*  Has math ethnic cleansing as its basis right move them out and we'll rebuild the Gaza Strip the other thing that I'm very curious [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2148.64s)]
*  You see how it plays out Tommy is that he clearly wants this Abraham Accords? [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2156.84s)]
*  White whale normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2161.48s)]
*  But Saudis have been pretty clear that they can't do that absent a Palestinian state or like a very credible [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2164.7200000000003s)]
*  Pathway to a Palestinian state and and yet they kind of keep talking themselves into [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2171.32s)]
*  The belief that this is gonna happen [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2176.68s)]
*  I mean you and I were going back and forth on this kind of strange [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2178.32s)]
*  Jerusalem Post report of BB and Trump and right on yeah and Marco Rubio like celebrating that this is gonna happen [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2181.36s)]
*  I mean I see no pathway forward here other than the continued annihilation of the people of Gaza and [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2188.68s)]
*  and just no plan for how to deal with that and no regard for the fact that [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2195.96s)]
*  This is the biggest humanitarian catastrophe in the world today and in any recent times and and Trump is doing nothing to stop it [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2200.52s)]
*  Yeah, and also like meanwhile been in the West Bank [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2209.24s)]
*  Israeli settlers are completely out of control and that this is part of a trend that has been worsening since the October 7th attacks [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2213.28s)]
*  Just for reminder for folks that the West Bank was captured by Israel in 1967 and Israeli settlements in the West Bank are [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2221.92s)]
*  Considered illegal by the international community [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2229.04s)]
*  But just in terms of the recent events so on Wednesday of last week over a hundred settlers [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2231.76s)]
*  Attacked the Palestinian town of Kafar Malik [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2238.2000000000003s)]
*  With Molotov cocktails and rocks [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2241.76s)]
*  They set homes and cars on fire and then Israeli troops responded to the scene by opening fire on Palestinians [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2244.48s)]
*  Killing three the IDF alleges that the Palestinians were throwing stones at them and shooting at soldiers [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2252.2400000000002s)]
*  But we just we don't know the idea of also arrested five settlers and then on Friday [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2258.36s)]
*  dozens of settlers attack some IDF soldiers in that same area and a teenage settler was wounded in that fight and then on Sunday night a [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2264.56s)]
*  Demonstration outside an IDF base near Ramallah turned into a riot with settlers swarming the base setting fires attacking soldiers and vandalizing properties [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2272.52s)]
*  So, you know violent settlers now attacking the IDF [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2280.2200000000003s)]
*  Since October 7th close to 900 Palestinians have been killed and thousands were wounded in the West Bank [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2283.7s)]
*  But there's almost never any accountability for that kind of violence [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2288.98s)]
*  The New York Times put it an Israeli rights group that examined more than 1,600 cases of settler violence in the West Bank between [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2291.86s)]
*  2005 and 2023 [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2298.98s)]
*  Found that just 3% ended in a conviction [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2301.1s)]
*  But this settler violence against the IDF did get Netanyahu's attention who said quote [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2304.1s)]
*  No functioning country can tolerate violent in [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2309.6400000000003s)]
*  anarchistic acts such as burning of a military facility [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2313.2000000000003s)]
*  Damage to Israeli military property and assaults on security personnel by the country's own citizens and then far-right lunatic politician [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2316.2400000000002s)]
*  It's more Ben Gavir called the violence against the military base a red line and I guess, you know [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2323.5600000000004s)]
*  Interesting that that's where he drew the red line then not [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2328.84s)]
*  Murdering, you know innocent Palestinian people. I mean no surprise again. This is a guy who literally is a terror sympathizer [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2332.0s)]
*  who used to have a [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2338.92s)]
*  photo of a Jewish mass murderer of Palestinians on his wall, but you know, it's interesting when these guys reveal themselves, so [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2340.2400000000002s)]
*  Then you know listeners to this show know that we were very hard on the Biden administration's Gaza policy in particular and his [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2347.96s)]
*  Handling of the relationship with Netanyahu [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2355.36s)]
*  However, this is an area where Biden did do some stuff took some important steps like putting forward this executive order [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2357.4s)]
*  That allowed the US to sanction people involved in or supporting settler violence [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2364.0800000000004s)]
*  Trump revoked those sanctions on his first day in office and I think is generally seen as [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2368.94s)]
*  A friend or fellow traveler of this settler movement. So it is a good example where the Trump policy has gotten worse [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2374.38s)]
*  Yeah, and and I think what people have to understand about the settler violence is, you know, we occasionally there's an incident that is so bad that [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2381.42s)]
*  Gets our attention, but this is entirely [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2388.38s)]
*  systematic violence, right this happens on a regular basis all the time and and look [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2391.5s)]
*  Most of the time as you mentioned there's total impunity to this right? They'll go they'll kill Palestinians [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2398.48s)]
*  They'll burn Palestinian homes. They'll harm Palestinians. Maybe they'll get arrested and then they'll get released right and so [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2404.76s)]
*  There's no surprise really that they feel the impunity to even go after the IDF because that's the kind of climate that has been created [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2412.1600000000003s)]
*  They kind of lawlessness that's been created in the West Bank [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2419.32s)]
*  And ensure this got the attention these really authorities that they attack the IDF [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2422.52s)]
*  But doesn't get their attention when they killed 900 Palestinians, you know, and I think the thing to watch here is [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2426.96s)]
*  Whether or not in the next three and a half years, which we have left of Trump, you know, hopefully [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2433.68s)]
*  It's just that [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2439.6s)]
*  Whether there's a move to annex the West Bank whether this kind of mixture of BB's [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2441.16s)]
*  Politics and the settler violence and the growth of settlements leads them to say now is the time to just try to annex the West Bank [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2446.7999999999997s)]
*  And displace the Palestinians from this part of their land as well [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2453.84s)]
*  And the only other thing I'd add to the Trump part of this is that look in addition to revoking those sanctions [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2457.92s)]
*  his ambassador in Israel Mike Huckabee refers to the West Bank as [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2465.2s)]
*  Judea and Samara those are the Israeli, you know terminology for what this land is [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2471.28s)]
*  Basically, Mike Huckabee says this is not the West Bank. This is not Palestinian land. This is not occupied land [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2477.1200000000003s)]
*  This is part of greater Israel and and that creates a climate of impunity from the United States of America when the ambassador [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2483.4s)]
*  Over there. So and by the way, he's not doing it because he you know, he's doing it because he's evangelical Christian, right? [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2491.44s)]
*  You know that we need the Israel to control this land so that you know, the second coming can happen [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2497.9199999999996s)]
*  They can be converted to Christianity, right? He's a big friend of the Jews until he's not [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2504.56s)]
*  The rapture happens right but this is all a climate of impunity right and Trump is feeding into it [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2509.72s)]
*  Yeah, Mike Mike Huckabee is a total fucking weirdo the text that he sent to Trump that then got published about how he was like [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2515.3599999999997s)]
*  God's servant on the earth and bomber on it was the one of the weirdest things I've ever read [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2522.08s)]
*  What was creepier by the way time I want to ask you the Mike Huckabee thing saying that he was God's servant or the Mark [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2526.04s)]
*  Ruta [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2531.2s)]
*  Calling Trump daddy [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2532.18s)]
*  Dude, extra what that thing you said? Yeah. Yeah in mark Ruta the the new head of NATO that um [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2534.04s)]
*  That broke through to like normies in my life [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2539.7599999999998s)]
*  People who are like this thing about that guy that called Trump daddy and I was like, yeah, it's honestly [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2542.2s)]
*  It's it's way worse than you think [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2546.6s)]
*  It's even worse than you think yeah, it's sadder than you think you know, Ben, you know, you make a really good point about this [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2549.52s)]
*  West Bank settler violence [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2555.1s)]
*  Rarely getting attention you're right [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2557.5s)]
*  This instance got an attempt made a lot of news because you had settlers attacking members the IDF [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2560.02s)]
*  It rarely gets it makes news when it's just you know [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2564.58s)]
*  settler on Palestinian violence one [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2568.02s)]
*  It is worth just sort of considering that and this sort of next quick mention, which is [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2571.46s)]
*  The some comments made at the Glastonbury Music Festival in the UK got a lot of attention [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2575.7799999999997s)]
*  For those who don't know it's like kind of like a Coachella style music festival in the UK iconic really famous looks super fun [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2582.38s)]
*  One of the artists performing this guy Pascal Robinson Foster who's part of a punk rap duo Bob Villain [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2590.26s)]
*  Led the crowd in a death to the IDF chant and this happened as the BBC was live-streaming also the the Irish band kneecap [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2596.58s)]
*  Performed they led chants like free Palestine as well as chants against British Prime Minister Keir Starmer [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2604.98s)]
*  Who said they shouldn't be performing at Glastonbury at all? So the Trump administration has already moved to punish [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2610.42s)]
*  Bob Villain the band they revoke their US visas so they can't tour [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2617.2200000000003s)]
*  Obviously, I do not condone chanting things like, you know death to the IDF. That is [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2621.58s)]
*  Hate speech that is inciting violence and it's not even remotely helpful to the Palestinian cause since you know [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2626.62s)]
*  Every defender of this war will now point to that to suggest that like, you know [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2632.3s)]
*  The Israeli government is a real victim here and not the people getting bombed in Gaza [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2636.46s)]
*  But apparently the police have opened a criminal investigation into both bands [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2640.86s)]
*  Which seems was surprising to me when I read it and there's all these recriminations at the BBC for not cutting the live stream [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2644.66s)]
*  And like I on some level I get that like, you know, it's fair to ask [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2652.9s)]
*  What why was there no one with sort of like a editorial eye on the proceedings that might like cut away to a different band [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2657.02s)]
*  Or why was it a 30-second delay? [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2663.1800000000003s)]
*  But I think that conversation is really missing the broader point of just how far gone [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2664.72s)]
*  Israel's reputation is with a lot of young people everywhere and that doesn't mean that it's okay to chant kill the IDF [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2670.52s)]
*  But like it it it it suggests how far the Overton window is moved [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2678.3599999999997s)]
*  You know what I mean? And just how radicalized young people are against this war and I don't know [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2683.9199999999996s)]
*  I guess I'm more surprised that people are surprised by that than almost anything else. And again, like I don't condone that speech [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2688.46s)]
*  I don't think it's helpful. It's obviously hate speech, right? Like fuck that that guy's an idiot [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2693.76s)]
*  he did not help anyone in Palestine or in Gaza by chanting that stuff, but like [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2698.2000000000003s)]
*  That's a probably a sentiment shared by a lot of young people [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2703.28s)]
*  Yeah, I know we should come back to this because look and I don't claim to be a Bob Villain fan [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2705.92s)]
*  but [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2712.76s)]
*  And look the hate speech is the point right like death to anybody's [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2714.36s)]
*  Bad look but I think people are missing [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2719.88s)]
*  Like if there's still people that are listening to us who are mad at us for our takes on on Israel [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2724.0400000000004s)]
*  I ask you to consider from your own perspective, which is that young people on the left and the right? [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2731.28s)]
*  Don't understand what the fuck is going on Gaza [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2739.44s)]
*  Like and see it is totally indefensible and these efforts to kind of quash any [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2741.88s)]
*  Discussion of it only make that worse, right? [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2747.96s)]
*  Because there was a lot of heavy-handed tactics in the UK leaving out to Glastonbury like to you know [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2751.1200000000003s)]
*  The BBC is not gonna play kneecap set or they named this one organization that had vandalized a couple of [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2756.6600000000003s)]
*  You know military hardware as a terrorist organization [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2764.48s)]
*  This is driving young people to Bob Villain to never heard of Bob Villain until I read all these reports [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2768.88s)]
*  About people being mad about this dude my I mean not to betray my own algorithm [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2775.12s)]
*  But my Instagram is full of like, you know, the kneecap set, you know [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2779.44s)]
*  Like and but also like I was watching like Theo von interview [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2782.7s)]
*  Thomas Massey, right the the kind of you know, Republican, right? [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2789.2s)]
*  Who's been against support for Israel and he was asking in this kind of befuddled way like hey [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2792.96s)]
*  What do we get out of all this billions of dollars you give to Israel, right? [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2798.18s)]
*  I just think that you're making a big mistake if you think that you're gonna like [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2801.8399999999997s)]
*  I mean just to name somebody like Jonathan Greenblatt who loves to like the head of the ADL [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2806.44s)]
*  Who loves to police anti-semitism and loves to call people who criticize Israel any summits? [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2812.0s)]
*  He may think that he can like, you know, try to intimidate certain mainstream media right on this stuff [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2817.2799999999997s)]
*  But they're you losing young people across the board here, right? [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2824.08s)]
*  Now fundamentally they're losing young people because of the conduct of what Israel is doing in Gaza [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2828.08s)]
*  But these this idea that you know, we're just gonna shut everybody up [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2833.04s)]
*  Is not the way to to to deal with young people. Yeah, then [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2837.32s)]
*  Jonathan Greenblatt actually wrote an op-ed in New York Post calling, you know [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2841.88s)]
*  a bunch of critics of the war in with Iran anti-semites [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2847.08s)]
*  He included me in there first suggesting that the Israelis dragged us into the war which [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2850.4s)]
*  For those who have eyeballs and who have been reading news reports about what happened [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2855.4s)]
*  Know that Netanyahu started a war with Iran knowing that Israel did not have the military [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2859.4s)]
*  Capabilities to take out Fordo their most important nuclear site and needed the US to do it which Trump then did so [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2864.6s)]
*  I don't know. I'm not entirely sure what is anti-semitic about that [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2870.5s)]
*  It's more just sort of stating the obvious but my response to him is this is a very naked attempt to silence [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2874.42s)]
*  Your political enemies by weaponizing the charge of anti-semitism and when you do that you set back very important [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2881.6400000000003s)]
*  Sincere efforts to combat anti-semitism in this country and around the world and that is a shame because the ADL [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=2889.1200000000003s)]

*  So a quick update on the latest in Ukraine where according to the Wall Street Journal the front line of the war now stretches [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3227.28s)]
*  750 miles from the northeast of the south of the country. Russia has started a summer offensive [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3233.34s)]
*  They've amassed 50,000 troops near the Sumi Oblast in the northeast [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3239.0s)]
*  Russian troops outnumbered Ukrainians three to one in the area, which is quite ominous [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3243.08s)]
*  Ukrainian soldier told the Wall Street Journal that Russians are losing around 300 to 400 soldiers a day and that quote their numbers are a [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3247.76s)]
*  Big problem for us, but though not enough to overrun us [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3254.76s)]
*  But let's hope that that holds the Washington Post reported that the Russian military [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3257.28s)]
*  Despite outnumbering Ukraine has still had lots of self-inflicted wounds that are hampering its progress [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3261.8s)]
*  There's corruption supply shortages bad intelligence bad training a Russian general and deputy defense [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3267.08s)]
*  Minister was just convicted of corruption and sentenced to 13 years in a penal colony [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3273.6s)]
*  So that's sort of a example how the fish rots from the head down [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3277.88s)]
*  Russia claimed to have captured the entire Luhansk Luhansk region [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3281.88s)]
*  One of four to legally annex back in 2022 if that is true [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3285.88s)]
*  It would be the first time that they have had complete control over one of those four regions [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3289.7599999999998s)]
*  A big milestone for Russia as of this recording there's been no comment from Keeve on the status [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3293.7999999999997s)]
*  So we'll see but I throw out all of this [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3299.72s)]
*  Russian missiles and drones have not let up an overnight barrage going to Sunday reportedly included over 500 drones and missiles another new record [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3301.8799999999997s)]
*  So any hope of sort of supply shortages from the Russian military have not borne out in a New York Times headline about the war [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3309.48s)]
*  So I said it all which was under a drone swarm sky surviving in eastern Ukraine [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3316.0s)]
*  On top of that Ben, you know the Financial Times Christopher Miller's friend the pot has been on the show a few times [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3320.7200000000003s)]
*  Wrote a piece about how the Russian FSB intelligence service is recruiting Ukrainian [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3326.0400000000004s)]
*  Teenagers to spy for them and conduct sabotage operations within Ukraine a Ukrainian official told him that [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3331.0800000000004s)]
*  25% of the 700 people they've arrested for espionage arson or pipe bombs that were directed by Russian intelligence [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3337.84s)]
*  We're under the age of 18 [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3344.5200000000004s)]
*  Sometimes it's like kids thinking that they were playing like a scavenger hunt like game with a financial reward [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3346.68s)]
*  So they end up like, you know taking a picture of some military site [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3353.04s)]
*  Uploading it to telegram thinking they're gonna get some cash and then they get arrested for it [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3355.92s)]
*  The UN Human Rights Office said Sunday that civilian deaths had increased 37% from December 2024 to May 2025 [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3360.08s)]
*  Compared to that same time frame the year before Ben [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3368.48s)]
*  I think a lot of that probably speaks to the fact that they're just running out of air defense systems [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3371.64s)]
*  I mean we saw how magnificently those patriot systems and the you know [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3375.88s)]
*  The THAAD and PAC 3 systems performed in Qatar and in support of the Israelis [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3380.36s)]
*  That has been missing in Ukraine. So a completely depressing update then no real endgame in sight here [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3386.12s)]
*  But you know an enormous [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3392.36s)]
*  Ongoing conflict. Yeah, no, I and you know Russia pressing its advantage, right? [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3394.96s)]
*  Five months after Trump said he'd end the war [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3399.7200000000003s)]
*  And their advantage being this war of attrition where they had more people a throat this thing and a bigger defense industrial base [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3402.48s)]
*  the only thing I'd add to that update Tommy is that we did have this NATO summit last week, right and [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3409.2400000000002s)]
*  the Europeans [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3415.64s)]
*  Who did not exactly quit themselves with glory here? [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3417.48s)]
*  We're so busy calling Trump daddy and promising to spend five percent of their budget on [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3420.64s)]
*  Defense we'll see if they actually do that [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3427.08s)]
*  What was lacking out of that summit was any plan to support Ukraine? [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3429.36s)]
*  Like normally like a NATO summit would be a place where you get together and be like [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3434.32s)]
*  What's the next package of defense support for Ukraine? What's the next package of Patriots for Ukraine? [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3439.04s)]
*  So that they can deal with this air defense issue [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3445.6s)]
*  What's the plan for the peace process right if Trump is mr? [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3448.24s)]
*  You would have thought that he would have gone to the NATO summit to talk to [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3452.6s)]
*  Ukraine's other key supporters and does Lansky himself about you know, what the status of these negotiations are and it was striking how [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3456.16s)]
*  That didn't really seem to be a big issue there [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3465.2s)]
*  it was like NATO was just trying to survive Trump showing up at a summit and [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3469.2s)]
*  And that's a bad sign, right? [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3473.84s)]
*  If you don't have any [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3475.88s)]
*  ability of the Europeans and and maybe the Americans to coordinate some defense support or some diplomatic support for Ukraine [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3477.88s)]
*  Then there really are just kind of out there on their own, you know [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3485.4s)]
*  Getting a trickle of support from the Europeans and maybe every now and then a delivery from the US but nothing like but they used to get [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3488.36s)]
*  Against a Russia that clearly feels emboldened. It clearly feels like they're pressing the advantage [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3494.8s)]
*  And so yeah, it's it's a pretty tough situation right now top situation [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3500.04s)]
*  And he didn't end the war in 24 hours. So [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3504.6s)]
*  No, no Nobel Prize there [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3508.12s)]
*  Let's jump continents to Africa though and talk about what Trump has dubbed a quote wonderful treaty between the Democratic Republic of Congo in Rwanda [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3510.04s)]
*  Which was signed on Friday at the White House. So this deal was brokered by the US and Qatar [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3517.4s)]
*  It's another data point for our future segment about their kind of interesting role in the in the world lately been [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3522.48s)]
*  Though I think the US effort built off of some recent previous work by the UAE [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3528.44s)]
*  But tension and fighting between Rwanda and the DRC goes back decades [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3533.64s)]
*  We won't get into all of that but the kind of recent history that's worth talking about is, you know in late 2021 [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3537.96s)]
*  This rebel group backed right Rwanda called m23 entered into the eastern part of the DRC and started taking territory in early [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3544.48s)]
*  2025 and 23 captured major cities in eastern Congo with the help of an estimated [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3552.32s)]
*  7,000 Rwandan troops with them like on the ground leaders in the DRC saw this invasion happening [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3557.84s)]
*  And at the same time they saw Trump staff [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3563.8s)]
*  Screaming at Zelensky and trying to ram this minerals deal down the Ukrainian president's throat [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3567.36s)]
*  So the the folks in the DRC decided to offer up something similar [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3572.2400000000002s)]
*  Which is basically try to give the US access to their rare earth minerals in exchange for some sort of US backed security guarantee [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3576.2400000000002s)]
*  Fast forward to last week [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3583.9399999999996s)]
*  That kind of mineral focused deal is basically what they signed in the Oval Office and it included the foreign ministers of the DRC and [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3585.7s)]
*  Rwanda, but there's a number of problems with this agreement. First of all, there's just no real detail out there [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3593.54s)]
*  It's very very thin both sides agreed to respect each other's territorial integrity and stop fighting and then to facilitate the disarmament of rebel groups [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3599.2599999999998s)]
*  Within the two countries [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3606.62s)]
*  They are also supposed to create some sort of like joint economic and security agreement to facilitate the extraction of these minerals [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3608.14s)]
*  But m23 again, which is that rebel group backed by Rwanda is currently occupying huge swaths of territory [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3615.46s)]
*  In the Congo, they weren't part of this agreement and there's no guarantee that they will abide by it [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3622.62s)]
*  In fact, there's reports that m23 has been setting up like what looks like basic kind of governance structures [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3627.66s)]
*  Like they're collecting taxes. They're vetting local leaders in Congo in this in this area [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3632.6s)]
*  They're occupying so that makes it sound like they're there for the long haul [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3637.24s)]
*  Human Rights Watch also reported that there's already been violations of the agreement [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3641.16s)]
*  So again, we'll have to watch closely but more broadly then I mean having the US having commercial interests in a region [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3644.68s)]
*  Hardly has guaranteed peace in the past right like Russia had commercial interests with Ukraine [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3650.6s)]
*  The US did business with Russia and Ukraine that didn't prevent the war there [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3655.7999999999997s)]
*  So finally, there's also the the little detail band of something like 80% of the Congolese mining sector sector is currently owned by [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3659.24s)]
*  China, I guess the US could invest in new areas or take ownership of smaller mines [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3666.6s)]
*  But the Chinese are gonna have a say here [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3674.28s)]
*  So Ben, I don't know the teams may be a touch premature to demand a Nobel Peace Prize for this one [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3676.16s)]
*  But what did you make of it? Yeah, I mean look, I guess it's like small progress here [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3681.2400000000002s)]
*  But this is such a Trump thing because this didn't solve any [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3686.76s)]
*  Underlying problem this has been a 20-year on again off again war in the Congo that has claimed millions of lives [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3691.3999999999996s)]
*  It didn't resolve the status of m23 [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3699.3199999999997s)]
*  The thing that I don't understand Tommy too [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3704.3999999999996s)]
*  Is it like the Ukraine deal like when are those minerals actually make see the light of day in the US equation? [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3706.8399999999997s)]
*  These countries are kind of playing they're kind of playing Trump, right? [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3713.8399999999997s)]
*  Like they they tell me to get minerals and and yeah, the Chinese own the mines [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3717.4s)]
*  The Russians are in the DRC like I'm not sure they're in a hurry to like provide the US of those minerals [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3722.08s)]
*  It's like he gets some kind of announcements of kind of headline about peace and minerals [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3729.1600000000003s)]
*  But let's like wait and see whether the peace holds and whether the minerals are delivered [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3735.2000000000003s)]
*  And and that's not a basis for lasting peace [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3741.2400000000002s)]
*  No [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3743.56s)]
*  Interest in like the livelihoods of the people in the DRC, right? He just kind of likes the idea of [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3744.56s)]
*  Having an announcement made at the White House and he gets to say he gets minerals what I don't understand about I mean again [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3751.8s)]
*  To be fair like sure. It's good that the Rwanda and the government the DRC you're talking to each other, but [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3758.64s)]
*  Let's not pretend like this is a durable change in their relationship, right? [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3764.12s)]
*  Now what I understand is this Nobel Peace Prize obsession because this is like the most globalist award [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3769.8s)]
*  Possible, you know, I mean, I don't know if this is because Obama got it [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3776.7000000000003s)]
*  Like I don't got me and these are kind of ceasefires at the well [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3780.28s)]
*  The thing is the US government like the Trump lifts these things up like the US government routinely [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3784.88s)]
*  Negotiated or mediated ceasefires around the world on an annual basis, you know as did other countries for years [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3790.6400000000003s)]
*  the disguise obsession with the Nobel Peace Prize is [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3798.0s)]
*  Like for all the work he's done to try to dismantle what Obama did [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3802.08s)]
*  His inferiority complex kind of like is so on display on this particular issue, you know, yeah [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3806.8s)]
*  This it is very weird. It's an obsession. Also. He keeps sending out [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3813.16s)]
*  Businessmen to cut what he calls peace deals, which are really just sort of temporary ceasefires. I mean this one was a good negotiated. Yeah [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3817.4s)]
*  Bullos whatever Tiffany Trump's father-in-law [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3824.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's just a business guy going [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3828.7599999999998s)]
*  To Africa and trying to extract resources from them. That's that's hardly a novel approach to the continent [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3831.3999999999996s)]
*  also been there there are all these rumors that [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3837.3399999999997s)]
*  Paul Kagame is in bad health [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3840.3999999999996s)]
*  Like he basically disappeared from the news for like three weeks and his plane was spotted in Germany [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3843.16s)]
*  And there were all there all these rumors that he was really really sick and getting treatment [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3847.72s)]
*  If he dies it kind of feels like all bets are off not just for this ceasefire deal [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3852.64s)]
*  But for what happens in Rwanda going forward? [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3857.36s)]
*  totally, I mean the totally dominant figure in Rwandan politics since Rwanda genocide in the early 90s and [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3860.04s)]
*  You know, there'd be huge vacuum because Kagame didn't really groom many, you know [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3867.2s)]
*  Succession plan right? He he's kind of one man one rule. So [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3872.72s)]
*  look [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3876.92s)]
*  modest step forward here, but like [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3878.56s)]
*  There's a lot of issues to be dealt with in Rwanda in the DRC with respect to these minerals and [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3881.44s)]
*  You know the people that have a better plan for the minerals or the Chinese who've been you know building mines there for years now [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3887.36s)]
*  You know not not and and actually what's interesting about [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3893.7799999999997s)]
*  Tiffany's father-in-law's role is that he's close to the Qataris. He's close to these [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3897.48s)]
*  to the Gulf Arabs [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3902.12s)]
*  so it is worth coming back to the fact that [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3903.88s)]
*  These people are in the middle of a lot of these deals and that's that's an interesting development here and it's a very [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3906.7999999999997s)]
*  Trumpy development. Yeah, very interesting. Very Trumpy. I also I'll just double-stamp what you said, which is [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3912.52s)]
*  Look, there were one in genocide [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3918.08s)]
*  Killed an estimated what 800,000 a million people when these extremist who to militias [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3920.16s)]
*  Massacred Tutsis and other moderate who to so anything that [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3926.24s)]
*  Is any sort of cessation of violence in this region is a very good thing and something we should be happy about but yeah [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3931.08s)]
*  It's hardly a permanent peace deal. Um been a bit of good news. So [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3937.04s)]
*  Despite Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's best efforts to ban it organizers of the Budapest Pride [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3941.16s)]
*  Rally estimated that as many as 200,000 people turned out for the event over the weekend up from 35,000 last year [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3947.84s)]
*  So back in March Parliament passed a law framed as a child protection measure that makes events that depict or promote homosexuality to minors [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3955.0s)]
*  Illegal this bill was explicitly banned are aimed at banning Budapest Pride and enabled law enforcement to use facial recognition software to identify and fine [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3962.96s)]
*  Attendees but with the support of Budapest liberal mayor the celebration went on without police interference [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3971.32s)]
*  attracting not just LGBTQ folks [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3977.92s)]
*  But also people who are just worried about the breakdown of democracy and free speech under Orban and even sweeter was [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3980.0s)]
*  Orban is behind the polls in to opposition leader Peter Magar and there's a chance he could lose in the general election next year [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3986.04s)]
*  Now I don't want to get ahead of myself, but we all are allowed to hope and so Ben there's all of course like a weird [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3993.08s)]
*  Trump angle here. I just wanted you to hear how State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce who is an out gay woman herself [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=3999.76s)]
*  Described the administration's view on this these huge protests. Let's listen [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4007.06s)]
*  Prime Minister Orban of course is a close ally the president tried to ban a pride parade this weekend [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4012.02s)]
*  Tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands people came out. Does the US have a view on that? [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4016.4199999999996s)]
*  Do you think that it's justified to ban a an LGBTQ pride parade? [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4020.4199999999996s)]
*  Well, you know when the vice president or any of us speak about the nature of policy or I think what's important regarding freedom of expression [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4024.4199999999996s)]
*  That's our plan and what we feel is important to convey and then what countries do is their business [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4031.82s)]
*  Events happen all over the world as we know every day which the United States has no comment about [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4036.82s)]
*  And we have nothing to add on this matter [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4043.82s)]
*  But again, I think it's it's about what other countries do the choices [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4047.82s)]
*  They make with their nations and and what citizens and do and how they respond to that [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4052.82s)]
*  Nobody talks about the events that we don't talk about Ben [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4057.82s)]
*  Do you have anything more cogent and coherent to say about this massive anti-orban pride rally? [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4060.82s)]
*  Look, I think this is a huge huge deal for a couple reasons right one just the pure solidarity with the LGBT community there like the refusal to [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4065.82s)]
*  You know a seed to or bonds command that does not go forward does show like, you know a really inspiring lesson to us [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4075.82s)]
*  I think that's a huge huge deal for a couple reasons right one just the pure solidarity with the LGBT community there like the refusal to [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4083.82s)]
*  You know a really inspiring level of solidarity with LGBT rights [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4090.82s)]
*  I also think importantly what the people in Hungary understand is that this effort to stigmatize LGBT people is part of a playbook that Putin pursued right? [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4095.82s)]
*  Of the kind of reactionary forces the kind of Christian forces against the decadence and corruption of the West [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4107.82s)]
*  You know, he really went after LGBT people LGBT rights [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4113.82s)]
*  He cracked down obviously on anything like a pride parade [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4119.82s)]
*  But he also cracked down on past these laws that persecuted essentially people for you know, trying to indoctrinate people into LGBT ideologies [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4122.82s)]
*  And so what the people of Hungary are saying is we see the playbook you're running right and we're not going to go for that [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4131.82s)]
*  And so not only is this an act of solidarity with that community [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4138.82s)]
*  It is saying like, hey, we see where you are on the playbook [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4142.82s)]
*  You're running where you are on the Putin playbook and we're going to come out 200,000 people in Hungary is a shit ton of people [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4146.82s)]
*  Okay, and that was a massive embarrassment to or bond it revealed him to be totally feckless [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4153.82s)]
*  He commanded that something not happen and then it happened bigger than it has ever happened before [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4160.82s)]
*  And I think there's a big lesson for Americans in this too [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4165.82s)]
*  Which is that when you have an autocrat who controls the media who controls the judiciary who's able to ram laws through [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4168.82s)]
*  You can show him to be powerless if you show up in the streets in big enough numbers [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4175.82s)]
*  And so hopefully this is a sign that or bond is on his way down in Hungary [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4180.82s)]
*  Hopefully Peter Magyar, you know, who's not exactly a progressive but he's much better than or bond can oust him [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4185.82s)]
*  But also I think it's a lesson for the rest of us that when all else fails, you know show up in the streets [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4191.82s)]
*  Because that can show the factlessness of an autocrat. Yeah. Well said. Finally been some of our listeners [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4196.82s)]
*  Might still be hoping to plan kind of a last minute summer getaway [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4202.82s)]
*  If you like sands surf and brutal repression, we've got a new option for you [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4207.82s)]
*  North Korea recently unveiled a new seaside resort. It features water parks high-rise hotels and room for [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4213.82s)]
*  Almost 20,000. Yes, that's a big resort [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4220.82s)]
*  Kim Jong-un personally cut the ribbon on what they're calling the calmer resort [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4223.82s)]
*  Which state media called a national treasure level tourism city [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4227.82s)]
*  It opened on July 1st, but only for domestic tourists for now [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4231.82s)]
*  But given its proximity to an international airport and the fact that the ribbon cutting ceremony was attended by the Russian ambassador [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4234.82s)]
*  North Korea clearly has its eyes on some international clientele in 2024 Ben a top you on human rights official described life in North Korea as [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4241.82s)]
*  Stifling claustrophobic a daily struggle devoid of hope kind of sounds like being a Democrat in Washington right now, but if that sounds good to you [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4249.82s)]
*  Consider a visit Ben. I would say I want to get your your take on this [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4257.82s)]
*  I think there's a one in five shot that Trump or JD Vance [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4261.82s)]
*  Visits this resort before the end of his second term thoughts. Oh [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4265.82s)]
*  I think so. I mean, this is kind of like Trump or Vieira vibes [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4270.02s)]
*  And yeah, like you made the serious point which needs to be made which is that in a country where people are starving [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4275.02s)]
*  Like, you know beachfront resorts are not the best look. I will say [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4281.02s)]
*  That the world those need to go watch some of the YouTube videos of this because [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4287.02s)]
*  You know Kim Jong-un looking at things is always interesting to watch [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4293.02s)]
*  This is incredible because the video there's like a two-minute video that they play the propaganda video that they put out and it kind of starts [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4298.02s)]
*  With him watch observing like some people going down a giant water slide Jesus and [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4305.02s)]
*  The funny thing about this is first of all, I'm wondering about the guy on the water slide because he's supposed to be like having fun [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4311.02s)]
*  Right. He's supposed to look like he's having fun, but you know if this guy makes a wrong move on the water side [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4319.02s)]
*  It's not gonna end well for this guy [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4324.02s)]
*  But then the other thing is they had so little content to fill this video that they came back to the guy on the water slide again [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4326.02s)]
*  Like they played it multiple times. You're watching it right now [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4333.02s)]
*  So it just didn't look like there was a lot going on at this beachfront resort [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4336.02s)]
*  Do you see the guy in the water slide? I'm watching the guy on the like surfing thing who bit it like four times in front of Kim Jong-un [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4341.02s)]
*  Terrified he's gonna get whacked now totally totally [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4347.02s)]
*  They have to have smiles on their faces and there are all these people out there like [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4351.02s)]
*  It's it's pretty dark but it does have that kind of 70s communist resort vibes, right? [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4355.02s)]
*  Like the big white hotel that is probably 90% empty at any given time [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4362.02s)]
*  I do wonder can you imagine I would love to go to this place for like a day [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4368.02s)]
*  Not that I would because we'd end up being imprisoned and Trump would have to get us out of prison [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4374.02s)]
*  but like can you imagine just like walking down to breakfast at that hotel like [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4378.02s)]
*  With your seven-miners [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4383.02s)]
*  It's like and Russian spies and Chinese, you know business people and I mean I can't imagine [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4385.02s)]
*  so someone needs to make a television show about what happens at this place because [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4392.02s)]
*  I would watch that. It would be absolutely fascinating. My fear is that some [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4397.02s)]
*  Very dumb young American tourist is gonna end up there and get in deep deep trouble [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4401.02s)]
*  But a story an anxiety for another day then one thing just before we wrap and then Trump will get him out of prison and [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4407.02s)]
*  Demand a Nobel Peace Prize again again one thing I just saw per our Ukraine conversation [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4413.02s)]
*  The White House confirms that his halted weapons that Ukraine was scheduled to receive including pack three Patriot missiles [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4419.02s)]
*  155 millimeter artillery rounds [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4426.02s)]
*  GML RS stinger aim seven and hellfire missiles. So that is not only air defense, but also offensive [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4428.02s)]
*  Weaponry there and a huge huge deal. I think for the Ukrainians to lose all that and why would you I mean like put aside the [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4435.02s)]
*  Hellfires and you know, we support Ukraine [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4443.02s)]
*  There's a halting of defensive weapons, right? Like like that's gonna lead to Ukrainian civilians dying [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4447.02s)]
*  Yep, I mean how how can you justify that, you know, no doubt no doubt [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4453.02s)]
*  All right. Well, that is it for us this week. Thank you all for listening and we'll talk to you soon [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4457.02s)]
*  We promise to be in slightly happier moods next week [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4463.02s)]
*  Slightly. Yes, we were pretty dark this week. Sorry [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4465.02s)]
*  You [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49l8fzQqgV8&t=4483.02s)]
