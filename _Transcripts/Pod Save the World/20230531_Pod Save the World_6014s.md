*  Even Mark Wahlberg. Yeah, Donnie Wahlberg [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=69.39999999999999s)]
*  I think standing gun he confused the two at one point said Marcus smart was taking acting lessons from Donnie Wahlberg [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=71.88s)]
*  Yeah, I think of the new kids. But yeah, anyway, we're not just gonna chat about sports today, though [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=77.19999999999999s)]

*  What the CIA knows or does not know when it comes to Israel's intentions when it comes to potentially bombing Iran [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=96.32s)]
*  The latest in Ukraine why China is giving the Pentagon the cold shoulder [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=102.83999999999999s)]
*  How panic of Poland could use fears of Russian political interference to silence opposition leaders? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=106.11999999999999s)]
*  Elon Musk is in China free speech. What could go wrong? Absolute is a mecca of free speech [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=112.08s)]
*  Venezuela it has been welcomed back into the South American fold and then there's the ongoing [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=118.84s)]
*  desperation of Boris Johnson just for fun then and then you're gonna hear my interview with [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  Journalist and author at Jay Temelkoren about how Turkish president tie up Erdogan [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=128.56s)]
*  Unfortunately won reelection and what it means for the future of Turkey Ben spoiler alert. It's not great. So the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=133.20000000000002s)]
*  Thing is Tommy, you know the quote that leads my last book after the fall is from her. Oh, yeah [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=140.24s)]
*  What was it? The final takeover does not happen with one spectacular Reichstag conflagration [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=145.56s)]
*  But is instead an excruciating years-long process of many scattered seemingly insignificant little fires [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=151.64s)]
*  That smolder without flames who that's a hell of a quote, which is you know a [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=158.32s)]
*  Cheerful way to describe what we've all been living through [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=163.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's a it's a more eloquent way of saying that the nationalists are boiling the frog [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=165.48s)]
*  Yeah, and for Turkey it's been 20 years of this 20 years, right 20 years. Imagine 20 years of Trump. No, no, I can't I can't [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=171.32s)]
*  Let's talk about the news Ben because on Monday [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=178.48s)]
*  Ugandan president yeah, we're you moose have any signed into law one of the harshest anti LGBT bills in the world [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=181.95999999999998s)]
*  Anyone who engages in gay sex in Uganda can get life in prison even minors can be sentenced up to three years [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=188.2s)]
*  And just attempting to have same-sex relations can get you ten years in prison [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=194.22s)]
*  They also created this new category they call aggravated homosexuality which could result in the death penalty that category is basically [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=198.34s)]
*  Your sex with kids disabled people rape [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=205.85999999999999s)]
*  Activists and aid groups are particularly worried about parts of the law that create criminal penalties for promoting homosexuality and provisions that encourage the public to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=209.54s)]
*  Report on others so they were really worried about visual anti-justice [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=217.66s)]
*  The US and other Western governments lobbied hard against this bill Biden called it shameful and said the National Security Council his staff [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=220.54s)]
*  Will review the entire US-Uganda relationship in particular America's ability to safely deliver HIV AIDS services [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=227.62s)]
*  Ted Cruz even denounced this law. That's how bad it is [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=235.78s)]
*  At the same time, unfortunately though American right-wing religious groups have helped promote these laws [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=239.02s)]
*  In anti LGBT sentiment in general in Uganda Uganda passed a similar about law back in 2014 [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=243.5s)]
*  They got struck down on procedural grounds. So this is like them coming back at this [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=249.82s)]
*  More broadly on the continent homosexuality is criminalized in 30 of 54 countries in Africa [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=253.9s)]
*  Former British colonies are far more likely to criminalize homosexuality than non former British colonies. That was interesting, but Reuters did a poll of [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=259.46s)]
*  48,000 Africans across 34 countries [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=268.82s)]
*  Where more than 75% of respondents across all ages said they would be strongly or somewhat [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=271.48s)]
*  Dislike having a gay neighbor. So there's really some entrenched [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=276.88s)]
*  Unfortunate views here and unlike most countries young people are essentially just as likely to have anti LGBT views as older people [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=280.92s)]
*  So it's not improving over time [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=288.44s)]
*  So Ben, you know South Africa is the only country in Africa to allow [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=289.84s)]
*  LGBTQ couples to and to marry enter civil unions and adopt children [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=293.84s)]
*  we've talked a bunch of times how [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=298.64s)]
*  There is this sense in in across the continent of Africa a well-deserved sense that the US shows up to lecture them and then leaves [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=301.0s)]
*  How do you think Biden's team can or should go about pushing back on laws like this? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=308.88s)]
*  Where you know, this is really like a basic human rights issue. It's an enormous. It's scary growing trend [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=313.92s)]
*  And there are people, you know in Uganda and across the continent who really want our support [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=319.76s)]
*  But also don't want to you know, create a political context where the US is doing more harm than good [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=325.04s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think there was a precedent, you know back in 2014 as you mentioned this [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=330.34s)]
*  I remember this kind of law coming down the transom in Uganda [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=335.61999999999995s)]
*  and [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=340.09999999999997s)]
*  There was a lot of international pressure including the US and they kind of did back down [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=341.46s)]
*  So the first point is I think you do have to put things tangible things on the table [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=346.26s)]
*  Uganda's gotten assistance United States in the past had a security relationship with Moussabini [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=351.2s)]
*  And I do think that there are certain [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=356.32s)]
*  Laws that are just kind of beyond the pale because this is not an just an LGBTQ [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=359.91999999999996s)]
*  Issue it's this is as you said, it's like a fundamental human rights issue. Yeah, when you have a whole community of people being [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=364.79999999999995s)]
*  Stigmatized marginalized and facing punishment in this way. So I think the first thing is this is a case where [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=372.52s)]
*  You know when you're calibrating these efforts around human rights and democracy [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=379.23999999999995s)]
*  Sometimes you can't make the perfect enemy of the good right? Do you have to understand you can't dictate [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=383.96s)]
*  Terms and laws in every country, but you have to be able to identify well what crosses certain lines where we will [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=388.52s)]
*  Revaluate our relationship. This is one of those places. That's the first thing. I think the second thing is there really is a [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=396.44s)]
*  unholy [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=403.52s)]
*  relationship between some of these anti LGBTQ laws in Africa and the US evangelical community and [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=405.52s)]
*  Look, it's all well and good for like a Ted Cruz to come out and say this laws wrong [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=411.84s)]
*  I'm glad he did but what you really need is more responsible voices in that community [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=416.15999999999997s)]
*  To try to slow down this train if not turn it around and so, you know [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=423.44s)]
*  there is a tradition of of of Republicans in [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=429.28s)]
*  Congress in particular who've been you know champions for things like PEPFAR the anti HIV AIDS [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=433.2s)]
*  Initiative that has done a lot of good in Africa that have this thing George W [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=438.96s)]
*  Bush ever did best thing he did by far that have deep relationships in Africa [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=442.76s)]
*  I think you need to be figuring out how to quietly try to mobilize those people [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=446.47999999999996s)]
*  To restrain some of the more extreme [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=451.35999999999996s)]
*  elements their own community and perhaps use their own [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=454.4s)]
*  relationships in Africa to [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=457.44s)]
*  Error different views and then to this broader issue that you describe. I mean, I do think you need to find [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=459.76s)]
*  cultural messages [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=465.44s)]
*  Defined cultural messengers with some credibility with African publics so that it's not just like us politicians talking about these things but [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=466.88s)]
*  Look, there's a long-term effort that's gonna have to be made [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=476.56s)]
*  To to try to destigmatize [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=481.44s)]
*  LGBTQ people in certain parts of the world you have to find credible voices in that effort beyond [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=484.21999999999997s)]
*  The political sphere, you know, and so I think that's something that people need to be working on too [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=491.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's a really good point. Man. What a terrible choice. I mean administering and delivering [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=497.04s)]
*  HIV AIDS drugs under the PEPFAR program or cutting that aid off because of this law [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=501.52000000000004s)]
*  I mean, that's just an incredibly difficult decision [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=507.68s)]
*  It is a great and I think you you have to have a very high threshold for cutting off that kind of assistance [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=509.88s)]
*  But there are other there are other [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=515.84s)]
*  Parts of the US-Ugana relationship that you could start with military support there's other kinds of development assistance. So [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=518.48s)]
*  You know you put that last on the list. I think yeah for sure [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=526.08s)]
*  I think I think they're reviewing it in part because they don't know that their staff on the ground can safely administer it given this [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=529.48s)]
*  New law. Yeah [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=535.0400000000001s)]
*  Which is which is ultimately a threshold that you have to be able to answer. Yes, absolutely [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=537.1600000000001s)]
*  Paz take the world is brought to you by zip recruiter [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=541.9200000000001s)]
*  How precious is time to you and what would you do with more saved time? Well, obviously [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=544.36s)]
*  I would spend it with my family. But after that I would go party hard. What about you guys? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=550.12s)]
*  I'm just sort of thinking about time as a something that we can collect in an area and spend [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=556.08s)]

*  Switching gears here to Serbia and Kosovo [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=828.08s)]
*  So 25 NATO peacekeepers in northern Kosovo were injured during attacks by Serb protesters on Monday [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=831.1800000000001s)]
*  These protesters were angry because last month Kosovo's Serb population boycotted some local elections [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=837.6800000000001s)]
*  The resulting low turnout meant that ethnic Albanians won a number of seats like mayoral ships and jobs like that [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=844.08s)]
*  And then after those politicians were installed into office last week [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=850.5400000000001s)]
*  Angry protesters tried to storm several local government offices and they clashed with these NATO troops and some of these troops were severely hurt [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=854.02s)]
*  Several Hungarian and Italian soldiers serving in the NATO peacekeeping force were injured leaders in Serbia and Kosovo [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=861.02s)]
*  You know blamed each other for raising the tensions the Serbian president Alexander Vucic even raised the military's combat readiness to a tie-as level [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=867.58s)]
*  So that's pretty ominous [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=875.84s)]
*  The US criticized authorities in Kosovo for installing these mayors in Serb majority areas where they clearly had no popular support [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=877.12s)]
*  The key context for everyone to remember is that Kosovo declared independence from Serbia back in 2008 [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=884.98s)]
*  But many ethnic Serbs have never accepted that especially in the northern part of the country [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=890.28s)]
*  Ben this is the latest in a series of flare-ups between the two sides that sort of start with these local issues like it was [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=895.42s)]
*  Licensed plates at one point a couple months ago [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=901.0600000000001s)]
*  How worried are you getting that you could see things spiral out of control in the near future? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=903.1999999999999s)]
*  I think people should be very worried and I think people should see this as an issue that is [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=907.8s)]
*  Really important obviously in Serbia and Kosovo, but is bigger than that as well [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=913.8s)]
*  so, you know part of what's happening here at core is that [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=917.84s)]
*  You had this repression of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo that led to a NATO intervention [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=922.1999999999999s)]
*  In the Clinton years that saved a bunch of lives but you know kind of led to the end of Slobodan Milosevic's rule in Serbia [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=927.5s)]
*  And led to this unresolved status of Kosovo. Is it independent as Kosovo has? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=936.34s)]
*  Declared and as the US and a whole bunch of other countries have recognized [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=942.5s)]
*  Or from the Serbian perspective they see parts of Kosovo particularly these majority Serbian parts as kind of fundamental to their identity [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=946.58s)]
*  Fundamental to their history and [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=954.26s)]
*  They are backed by Russia and China [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=957.28s)]
*  And so and so you see that the same geopolitical fault lines that we walk across every week on this podcast [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=960.28s)]
*  Like run directly through this part of Kosovo [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=967.56s)]
*  Did you see that Serb protesters painted the the Z the letter Z on NATO vehicles like to? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=970.52s)]
*  To mimic the Russian invasion force in Ukraine. Yes, absolutely. No one's hiding the Russian piece of it [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=976.2s)]
*  Yes, absolutely, but no one's hiding the Russian piece of this nobody's hiding the Russian piece of this and [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=981.46s)]
*  And so the bet that was made I think [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=987.1400000000001s)]
*  around Kosovo independence was that [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=990.38s)]
*  Both Serbia and Kosovo had kind of the enticement of EU integration [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=993.0600000000001s)]
*  That someday they might be able to join the European Union and that could give them incentives to [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=998.0200000000001s)]
*  Normalize their relations kind of work through some, you know, maybe some autonomy for some of these [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1003.4200000000001s)]
*  Like majority Serbian areas that's clearly not working that that that was the old globalization playbook and it's just not working, you know [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1008.92s)]
*  and and to your point [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1016.72s)]
*  The Russians are clearly stirring this pot right now. You've got a nationalist president of Serbia [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1019.16s)]
*  You also have a nationalist president Kosovo. The Russians are not hiding this like I saw Sergey Lavrov [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1024.52s)]
*  The longtime foreign minister of Russia said the other day that quote [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1030.84s)]
*  Serbs are fighting for their rights in northern Kosovo a big explosion is looming in the heart of Europe [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1034.42s)]
*  Those are Lavrov's words, right? So what would Russia want more today than [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1040.22s)]
*  Another flare-up of instability and violence in the heart of Europe that embarrasses NATO that makes them look feckless [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1046.06s)]
*  That makes him look like incapable of managing this issue. That was one of NATO's major interventions in its recent history [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1053.26s)]
*  So there's a lot of incentive for the Russians to be pushing Serbia to take a hard line and maybe to be pushing some of these [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1060.12s)]
*  Serbian separatist actors to be doing what they're doing and that's kind of like back to the drawing board here [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1068.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm just trying to avoid escalation for the time being and in the US has been kind of pressuring Kosovo [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1074.08s)]
*  To dial back and you're pushing the envelope in these areas and to show some restraint [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1080.4399999999998s)]
*  I think ultimately that's the wise decision you want to just reduce tensions and let this thing [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1085.78s)]
*  Park itself for for the time being yeah [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1091.58s)]
*  Because a lot of side to installing a bunch of mayors the day we need like maybe slow down a little bit [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1094.1s)]
*  Is that really worth the risk here? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1098.66s)]
*  And especially when Russia is jonesing for an excuse to to to stir up, you know [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1100.46s)]
*  real violence in the heart of Europe to create a distraction or [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1105.26s)]
*  Yet another boiling pot in addition to Ukraine [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1109.06s)]
*  Yeah, and then the the tennis piece of this is Novak Djokovic the 22-time Grand Slam champion [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1111.46s)]
*  Wrote in Serbian on a TV camera at Roland Garros at the French Open [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1117.4s)]
*  Kosovo is the heart of Serbia stop the violence which sounds like to yeah [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1121.8400000000001s)]
*  I know your average viewer are probably kind of innocuous. It really is, you know, yeah [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1127.72s)]
*  It's a clear statement undercut to Kosovo's independence. I think joke of it. It's an ethnic serv his father was born in Kosovo [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1132.16s)]
*  He thinks Kosovo is part of Serbia [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1138.92s)]
*  He's writing this on the lens of a camera while playing. Yeah, I have to say we've learned a fair amount about Djokovic [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1141.3000000000002s)]
*  There's a reason that he's made more appearances on this podcast than any other tennis player in recent years and none of its good [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1148.1000000000001s)]
*  Remember a factor of 20 anti-vax guy like refused to get vaxed before he went to the Australian Open got kicked out of that country [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1153.7s)]
*  He's kind of weighed in, you know generally in the flavor of that kind of stew of Russian [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1160.9s)]
*  Anti-vax [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1167.76s)]
*  nationalist conspiracy theories and to say like Kosovo is the heart of Serbia is [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1168.8400000000001s)]
*  about as provocative a [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1173.76s)]
*  statement as you can make on a [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1175.96s)]
*  current geopolitical area of tension [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1178.5600000000002s)]
*  So I would hope that that he's [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1181.3200000000002s)]
*  Dissuaded from using his platform pretty massive platform at the French Open from doing so [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1184.24s)]
*  Yeah, a bunch of NATO peacekeepers just got the shit beaten out of them by Serb nationalists [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1188.3200000000002s)]
*  And you're basically writing a slogan that could be a piece of graffiti on the wall right backing them [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1193.4s)]
*  Yeah with it with the Z over it [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1197.8600000000001s)]
*  Unbelievable unbelievable what an asshole speaking of assholes pen. There's been a bunch of reporting. Thank you recently [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1199.8600000000001s)]
*  That's just Trump is in serious legal jeopardy over the handling of classified documents that he stole and hoarded at Mar-a-Lago [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1205.8200000000002s)]
*  So we talked last week about how special prosecutor Jack Smith [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1212.66s)]
*  Had subpoenaed a bunch of Trump's business records with seven foreign countries including some of our favorites in the Gulf [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1216.38s)]
*  Since then the Washington Post has reported that Trump's team [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1222.28s)]
*  Moved boxes of records at Mar-a-Lago the day before the FBI visited in June of last year [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1226.1200000000001s)]
*  The post also reported that quote Trump and his aides also allegedly carried out a dress rehearsal for moving sensitive papers [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1233.1200000000001s)]
*  Even before his office received the May 2022 subpoena you got to practice your crimes to get him, right? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1240.24s)]
*  Then on Tuesday the Guardian reported that Evan Corker and Trump's lawyer has been managing this issue [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1245.64s)]
*  Told his associates that he was misled when he tried to do a search at Mar-a-Lago for classified materials [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1250.0600000000002s)]
*  The apparently members of Trump's team told Corker and not to search Trump's office where the FBI later found [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1255.6200000000001s)]
*  some of the most sensitive stuff [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1263.3000000000002s)]
*  That's how I assume prosecutors convince a judge to pierce Trump and Corker and attorney-client privilege [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1265.5800000000002s)]
*  Because Trump may have used Corker and legal advice in furtherance of a crime [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1271.0600000000002s)]
*  So Ben I have no idea if these news reports are accurate [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1275.44s)]
*  I mean, I assume they are the Trump people deny them it's worth saying [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1278.2s)]
*  But it seems like someone is gonna get charged with obstruction of justice in the very near future [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1280.92s)]
*  Yeah, this is like a pretty open and shut case, you know in many ways in many ways [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1287.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean there was you know that we talked about the New York one is kind of this bank shot legal theory [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1292.3600000000001s)]
*  Right of like hush money payments as a crime state law. Yeah [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1298.2s)]
*  This is like you're not supposed to take the classified documents with you [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1302.54s)]
*  If you do you get kind of a warning in this opportunity to return them [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1305.7s)]
*  And then if you continue to not do that you are committing a crime [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1309.82s)]
*  And then if they want to come pick up the evidence of the crime and you got a bunch of people like throwing [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1314.1s)]
*  Misdirection and misinformation at the FBI and then furiously hiding boxes [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1319.26s)]
*  like it is pretty evident that they committed at a minimum obstruction of justice and [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1323.6599999999999s)]
*  Like the underlying question of why [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1329.12s)]
*  Again, why were they so intent on hiding this material? [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1331.88s)]
*  I know because like it like let's say they did just take some letters for you know [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1335.56s)]
*  for nostalgia sentimental purposes [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1340.84s)]
*  Like I don't know that you would go to great lengths to hide that from the FBI [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1343.56s)]
*  You know, right and again to your point like not well hidden from the FBI [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1347.52s)]
*  There's security cameras showing these people moving boxes in and out of these rooms. I was very much in the like kind of [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1351.64s)]
*  Selfish moron [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1357.7s)]
*  Occam's razor camp of like Trump wanted to keep his documents because he thinks they're his and he's just a brat about everything [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1359.34s)]
*  I have moved considerably into a more conspiratorial and darker place given the subpoena of these records including [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1366.46s)]
*  Trump's dealings with the live golf tour, which is just the perfect way to wash money coming back to him for I don't know [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1374.94s)]
*  Maybe some information. I mean every day we learn something new and it look we're all burned by the Mueller probe [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1381.78s)]
*  Right and all the leaks in the New York Times about you know, whatever [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1386.38s)]
*  So I think we're all a little bit jaded when it comes to believing that this stuff could be real [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1389.8200000000002s)]
*  But I don't know it seems like they got a pretty good, right? No, let's speculate rashly here [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1395.16s)]
*  I love it. But like there's a lot of smoke here, right? [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1399.6000000000001s)]
*  So this is actually not that rash right we're gonna roll the tape all the way back to our friend Jared Kushner, right and [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1403.0s)]
*  There were those reports that really jumped out to us at the time [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1410.6000000000001s)]
*  When [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1414.8799999999999s)]
*  Mohammed Salman was like detaining his family members in the Ritz-Carlton and purging members of the royal family [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1416.02s)]
*  There were those reports that maybe Jared Kushner had shared some intelligence on what members of the family might not be totally with the program [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1421.72s)]
*  We still don't know that that's the case [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1428.1799999999998s)]
*  But the reason I mention it is because the US intelligence community collects like vast troves of information about the Middle East [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1430.06s)]
*  You know about things are going on in Saudi and the Gulf [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1436.9399999999998s)]
*  But also about things that the Saudis are really interested in like, you know political developments in neighboring countries [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1440.72s)]
*  nuclear issues in Iran or you know Israel or you know, the status of whatever is happening in Libya or Sudan any number of things that [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1446.5s)]
*  Don't seem like the [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1456.16s)]
*  Absolute front burner intelligence thing. So it may not be that like, you know, Trump is sitting there holding the blueprints to you know [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1457.96s)]
*  Every single last nut and bolt of of information [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1465.2s)]
*  But if he has anything that he was like grabbed on the way out [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1468.48s)]
*  I was like, oh this might be of interest to the Saudis and why and you know, which could be a lot of things, right? [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1471.42s)]
*  Yeah, maybe he just had a few folders of stuff because he thought it might impress and help curry favor with some of these people [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1476.16s)]
*  that he wants to you know [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1482.68s)]
*  Extract money from or build a relationship with like the fucking live golf tour, whatever the thing is [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1485.2s)]
*  It's it's an entirely plausible scenario that he had some of that stuff amongst other stuff [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1491.2s)]
*  maybe like love letters from Kim Jong-un and and [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1497.08s)]
*  Wouldn't want the FBI to get that stuff because he wouldn't know how to explain why you had it there [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1500.08s)]
*  So he's trying to move it around or something, right? That's one theory [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1503.54s)]
*  I'm getting a little more specific than previous rash speculation [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1506.4399999999998s)]
*  but when you look at these different reports of [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1509.3799999999999s)]
*  Them like trying to move around certain stuff and kind of make certain stuff harder to find at the same time that we're hearing that [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1511.84s)]
*  They're these investigations into the relationship he had with seven countries and the live golf tour might have featured [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1517.6599999999999s)]
*  Everything we know about his transactional relationship and his son-in-law's transactional relationship with the Gulf countries suggests that [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1523.3200000000002s)]
*  Why would Trump not? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1530.42s)]
*  Potentially wanted to take some information that could be valuable to them [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1533.7s)]
*  Yeah [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1536.26s)]
*  And remember that you know Jared Kushner got two billion dollars from the Saudis despite having no investment experience for his little investment company [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1536.7s)]
*  We had to your point again bucket this into the rank speculation category [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1543.0600000000002s)]
*  But Mohammed bin Salman knows that the United States [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1546.5400000000002s)]
*  In the Turkish government had him dead to rights when it comes to ordering the hit on Jamal Khashoggi the Washington Post journalist [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1550.24s)]
*  Who was murdered in the consulate in Istanbul? I bet MBS would love to know how valuable that report be [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1556.78s)]
*  How would he like because you know, I'm sure that there is somewhere like a stapled, you know [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1562.68s)]
*  20 page summary of the case against Mohammed bin Salman [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1566.8s)]
*  Just think about how valuable piece of information that he would want to know what the US knows [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1570.56s)]
*  How we know it how we know it who talked who might have talked? [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1574.9199999999998s)]
*  I mean, this is not trivial stuff that is that is that is stuff that's worth billions [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1578.0s)]
*  Yeah, speaking of intelligence collection in the Middle East Ben [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1581.68s)]
*  There is another news report based on the leak of classified a Pentagon documents to the social media site discord [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1585.24s)]
*  This time is about Iran one intelligence document says that the CIA [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1591.48s)]
*  doesn't know whether Israel is seriously planning to bomb Iran's nuclear infrastructure or whether these recent military exercises and hawkish rhetoric is just [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1596.56s)]
*  Designed to deter them frighten people in Iran frighten their leadership [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1604.6s)]
*  This there's a story in the intercept that also looks at Biden's, you know, seemingly more hawkish position on Iran [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1609.32s)]
*  Jake Sullivan Joe Biden National Security Advisor gave a speech where he recently said quote [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1614.9599999999998s)]
*  We have made clear to Iran that it can never be permitted to attain a nuclear weapon [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1619.8s)]
*  In the later set as President Biden has repeatedly reaffirmed [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1623.76s)]
*  He will take the actions that are necessary to stand by this statement including by recognizing Israel's freedom of action [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1627.28s)]
*  Two things that jumped out of me here bends when I read the story [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1634.72s)]
*  The first is I did wonder whether intelligence about Iran's military intentions [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1637.2800000000002s)]
*  Would be so close-holed that it maybe wouldn't wind up in a document like this [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1642.2800000000002s)]
*  I'm curious if you have a take there been to I'm curious how you interpret [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1645.42s)]
*  Jake saying that Biden will recognize Israel's freedom of action when it comes to Iran [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1649.68s)]
*  that seemed pretty different than the Obama era policy of [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1655.2s)]
*  actively dissuading them from starting a [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1659.72s)]
*  World War three in the Middle East. Yeah, I mean on first of all, it doesn't surprise me [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1663.2s)]
*  It wouldn't I wouldn't expect the CIA or the US intelligence community to know what Israel's intentions are [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1667.6s)]
*  I think you know, I don't think it reveals anything to say like in the Obama years [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1674.8s)]
*  When this is also a very live question, I think it was generally thought that this would be an incredibly close closely held [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1680.24s)]
*  Let's just say that the the Israeli government probably wouldn't be running some broad interagency process to consider whether or not to bomb Iran [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1688.02s)]
*  You know, baby his defense minister Jeff Goldberg at the Atlantic. Yeah [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1694.78s)]
*  Guests no, but they they have like what's called the security cabinet [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1701.02s)]
*  Which is like an inner inner cabinet of like the most senior security officials [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1704.22s)]
*  And I think it's generally believed by analysts and again [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1708.18s)]
*  This is not even an intelligence statement that like this would be restricted to a few people if that, you know [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1710.9s)]
*  Before it start it wouldn't start to bleed out [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1717.3s)]
*  into [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1720.46s)]
*  The US intelligence community knowing something probably until they were actually already beginning to do [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1721.42s)]
*  Yeah, I mean the plans are on the shelf. Yeah, right BB that one day would say okay take the plan off the shelf implement it [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1726.82s)]
*  Just go. Yeah [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1731.62s)]
*  Yeah, cuz they've done immense planning and to generate options with this. I [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1732.78s)]
*  I agree on the formulation from Jake Sullivan like the the Obama era formulation was you know [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1736.94s)]
*  Iran must be the first part of that we would have said, you know [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1744.48s)]
*  They must be prohibited from developing a new weapon and we would say like all options are on the table, you know [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1747.3999999999999s)]
*  But then usually when he said that it was followed by a bunch of paragraphs about why we shouldn't use the military option [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1753.04s)]
*  Yeah, why we're pursuing an Iran nuclear agreement all that, you know context is now gone, right? [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1759.82s)]
*  And to say that you know, we recognize Israel's freedom of action [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1765.1999999999998s)]
*  It's not just that statement it's that statement without all the other language about this is a bad idea [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1769.44s)]
*  Don't do it right or any live effort to get back in the JCPOA the Iran nuclear agreement if that thing's just dead [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1775.4s)]
*  It's dead. And again, this is just sitting there and Iran is sitting on the precipice of having enough material for a nuclear weapon [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1781.1200000000001s)]
*  They obviously we've talked about how they'd have to take some extra time to weaponize it [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1787.48s)]
*  but [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1791.5600000000002s)]
*  The this continues to be a space where you know [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1792.92s)]
*  And statements like that [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1796.0s)]
*  You know could be used after the fact to say well, you know, oh absolutely after the fact [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1798.0s)]
*  Well, you said we had freedom of action. We we chose to act, you know [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1803.76s)]
*  Oh, I feel like even far less specific diplomatic [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1807.0s)]
*  Pablum has been used by foreign countries say we thought you gave us the green light to attack X Y or Z country [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1810.8s)]
*  And so I it makes me wonder [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1816.96s)]
*  I mean, I have to think that the US is privately in the US and I think that's a good thing [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1818.52s)]
*  So I it makes me wonder I mean I have to think that the US is privately cautioning against you know doing something [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1822.32s)]
*  That could precipitate another war on top of the wars were already managing [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1829.76s)]
*  But yeah, this is this is one that you know [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1835.48s)]
*  You wonder whether [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1839.92s)]
*  BB might want to if he wants to take this risk [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1841.72s)]
*  Given the combination of his own political challenges at home and a US election cycle in which Trump will support anything and everything he does [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1846.04s)]
*  Whether he might think that he can gradually box Biden into to [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1854.56s)]
*  Not dissuading it not good. Not good scary watch this [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1860.32s)]
*  Then speaking of nuclear confrontation the Wall Street Journal reported that the Chinese government [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1865.8799999999999s)]
*  Refuse your request for a meeting between the US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and the Chinese Defense Minister [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1870.96s)]
*  Li Shengfu at an upcoming security meeting in Singapore [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1877.1599999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of concern in Washington as I think we talked about on the show about China's refusal to establish [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1880.36s)]
*  Regular military to military communications with the US or create some sort of hotline to manage a future crisis like the balloon [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1886.72s)]
*  idiocy [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1894.0s)]
*  Some of this meeting refusal likely is residual anger about the US shooting down the Chinese spy balloon [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1895.2s)]
*  But then the journal story also mentioned that the US still has sanctions [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1902.88s)]
*  And defense minister Lee that were put in place in 2018 by the Trump administration [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1907.64s)]
*  Because Lee approved the purchase of Russian fighter jets and Russian missiles [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1912.44s)]
*  Call me crazy, but would you take a meeting with the government that was sanctioning you? [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1916.92s)]
*  I wonder isn't that maybe most of the problem here might sour the mood a little bit [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1921.76s)]
*  I a couple things on this first of all [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1927.16s)]
*  I don't know if you've ever been to the Shangri-La dialogue. No, I've heard it's great [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1929.92s)]
*  so the Shangri-La dialogue is you've heard us kind of talk about the Munich Security Conference, which is kind of like the prom for [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1934.52s)]
*  Transatlanticists, you know security types the Shangri-La dialogue is like the Asian version of the Munich Security Conference [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1943.48s)]
*  Or you might even say the Munich Security Conference is the European version of the Shangri-La [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1950.32s)]
*  so all the muckety mucks all the defense ministers all the Henry Kissinger is love to show up at this place and [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1954.24s)]
*  and so this will like reverberate point is that [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1960.28s)]
*  The absence of this meeting will be the hallway chatter at the Shangri-La dialogue and will kind of contribute to this sense [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1963.52s)]
*  That the US and China are careening in this, you know direction of conflict and Cold War [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1969.1599999999999s)]
*  I think what's happened here in addition to the guy being sanctioned is [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1973.6s)]
*  The Chinese had this entire sequence kind of mapped out for the year, right? [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1978.12s)]
*  Which was like Biden was going to meet with Xi Jinping and Bali at the G20 in in November that happened [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1982.28s)]
*  And then it was me followed up by all these engagements that were kind of sequenced like Tony Blinken was going to go over there [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1988.12s)]
*  And then Lloyd Austin had this meeting and I think that once the balloon thing derailed their their [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=1993.12s)]
*  Carefully constructed engagement plan and Tony Blinken canceled his trip. They're kind of like, okay, that's [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2000.28s)]
*  All off like wiped a slate clean and it's probably in their mind gonna take another Biden Xi Jinping [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2005.84s)]
*  Meeting or interaction to be the umbrella to then resume these kind of more thorny cabinet level [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2012.8s)]
*  Discussion so I think it's just a sign the whole relationship is in deep freeze since that balloon thing [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2019.9199999999998s)]
*  And it's gonna take kind of a presidential level engagement to unsick it [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2025.52s)]
*  Yeah, and Biden keeps getting asked about this and they'll say like yeah, no, you know, no call planned [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2029.44s)]
*  But I think it's gonna happen and then he'll often say but we really got to reestablish this hotline [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2033.6399999999999s)]
*  You know, like they're not hiding what they want out of Washington isn't and and you know [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2037.56s)]
*  Jake Sullivan had this eight-hour meeting in Vienna with his counterpart recently. I was hoping that might unstick [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2042.04s)]
*  Some of this stuff, but apparently not the Shangri-La, which is kind of why I'm wearing like I'm wondering [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2048.16s)]
*  I don't know. I'm just hoping I guess that the sanctioned piece of this is [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2053.68s)]
*  Carrying some added weight and that isn't a broader relationship thing, but maybe that's wrong [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2057.92s)]
*  Yeah, I it feels broader to me, but it probably doesn't help and you might want to you know [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2061.56s)]
*  Just look at the Trump era sanctions again, particularly in light of the guys to defense minister, but the [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2066.56s)]
*  You know, we've come a long way from when Biden used to brag on the campaign that he had spent more time with Xi Jinping than any living [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2072.8s)]
*  Human being on earth, you know [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2079.7599999999998s)]
*  Remember those days like talking and now it's like I'll get to get around to calling him at some point [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2081.7599999999998s)]
*  But uh, but we can have a hotline, you know [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2086.72s)]
*  Speaking of China Ben so [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2088.72s)]
*  Free speech absolutist newly minted Republican hero Elon Musk traveled to Beijing [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2091.12s)]
*  Did Secretary of State David Sachs accompany? [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2097.3599999999997s)]
*  I don't know. That's too inside. I'll check. I'll check [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2100.24s)]
*  Elon had meetings with Chinese state counselor and foreign minister. Tinggong. This was on Tuesday [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2103.4399999999996s)]
*  Here's what a Chinese government spokesperson tweeted about the meeting. Here's a quote promoting sound China [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2109.68s)]
*  Relations is like driving a car one needs to keep to the right direction [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2115.7599999999998s)]
*  Hit the brakes when the road is bumpy and step on the gas for mutually beneficial cooperation [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2119.68s)]
*  Then now they started speaking for musk musk said that with hard working and talented people china's development makes perfect sense [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2123.92s)]
*  Hashtag Tesla opposes decoupling or cutting off supply chains [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2131.04s)]
*  It is ready to expand business in china and share in china's development opportunities [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2134.64s)]
*  Ben I saw that fidelis [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2140.3199999999997s)]
*  Said that they have marked down the value of their stake in twitter and believe it's now worth [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2142.32s)]
*  One-third of what elon paid for it [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2147.44s)]
*  I wonder if that is part of why he's traveling to china to kiss the ring to keep the tesla sales going and maybe not [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2149.44s)]
*  Bringing up. I don't know free speech [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2156.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, there's so much going on here. I love this story every now and then when you send topics and [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2158.7200000000003s)]
*  I just because this is so many dimensions to this one [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2163.6000000000004s)]
*  You know because the first one is the first one is the first one [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2167.6800000000003s)]
*  Um [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2170.4799999999996s)]
*  you know because the first thing is obviously like when you buy one of the one of the larger social media platforms in the world and [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2171.68s)]
*  And particularly one that's out outsized that has outsized influence on political questions [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2178.16s)]
*  um, and then you go hat in hand and kowtow to the most totalitarian government in the world that seeks to use twitter to [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2183.6s)]
*  identify [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2193.02s)]
*  Critics in other countries, you know, i've heard stories in you know recent months of [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2194.3199999999997s)]
*  Chinese citizens who've been arrested on return to china for instance [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2199.92s)]
*  Because of things that they posted on social media in other countries. They obviously want to censor [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2204.1600000000003s)]
*  Certain things on on twitter or control it even outside of china's borders and they certainly run [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2210.08s)]
*  Significant amounts of state-sponsored disinformation campaigns on twitter. This is well documented, right? [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2216.32s)]
*  So this is not like like so elon musk owns a platform that the chinese government uses to monitor people [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2220.56s)]
*  And to spread disinformation across the west [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2228.16s)]
*  And he's going there and kissing their ass [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2231.6s)]
*  That should make you wonder about you know, where twitter's going and what it serves. It certainly should make you question [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2234.0s)]
*  Whether his real interest is [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2241.44s)]
*  Free speech or whether it's a mixture of vanity and anti-woke politics, right? [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2243.68s)]
*  I mean this guy there's nothing nothing about his interactions in china suggested this guy [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2248.24s)]
*  Genuinely cares at all about free speech [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2253.76s)]
*  You know who agrees with us here, uh is my buddy steve bannon who's constantly attacking elon and saying he's just a tool of the ccp [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2255.28s)]
*  which is you know overstated and ridiculous, but [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2262.6400000000003s)]
*  There are some on the right in the republican party who are calling bullshit on this and this photo op [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2265.6000000000004s)]
*  In beijing will not help him with those people [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2270.2400000000002s)]
*  No, it's interesting to the extent to which he you know elon at the end of the day despite the the plummeting twitter [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2273.0400000000004s)]
*  Uh market cap, you know like or I guess it's private again now, right? Yeah, sure whatever. Um, but uh, like I like [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2278.8799999999997s)]
*  When when I I do believe that ultimately like his core wealth depends on tesla for sure spacex [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2287.2799999999997s)]
*  Supply chains in china are part of that customer base in china's part of that [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2294.96s)]
*  That he'll always put that interest ahead of whatever his hobby horse politically in this meeting made shares of tesla go up 5% [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2299.04s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's sort of that's purpose but like ronda santas like let's put the question to him because i'm sure he's gonna be running [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2305.68s)]
*  As an anti ccp warrior no doubt what it exposes is that this kind of crypto bro tech anti woke anti esg [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2311.36s)]
*  anti dei [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2318.7s)]
*  You know universe of people that the gop thinks are now part of their tent [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2320.48s)]
*  Like are just diametrically opposed to them on on a core issue of of of china [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2324.56s)]
*  And so whenever you see elon buddying up with ronda santas just keep that in mind, you know [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2330.4s)]
*  One of those people is a hypocrite if not both, uh, probably both [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2335.92s)]
*  But the other thing is the decoupling language is interesting because for all of his vaunted influence [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2339.12s)]
*  Elon musk cannot stop decoupling it is happening. No, no us government [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2344.64s)]
*  Which is more powerful than elon musk and well through the neon musk [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2348.16s)]
*  Is setting up a massive regime of export controls to deny technology into china to deny us investment into china [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2351.28s)]
*  And ultimately that's going to ensnare aspects of elon musk's enterprise and going over there and kissing the ring [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2358.08s)]
*  Whatever you think about that decoupling is not going to reverse it, you know [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2364.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2367.3599999999997s)]
*  And now twitter has become a place where like right wing morons who bought blue checks who a year ago complained about cancel culture are now [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2367.68s)]
*  trying to [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2375.4399999999996s)]
*  Uh lead boycotts of chick-fil-a for hiring a vp of diversity. Yeah, so they all right. Yeah, this is how you spend your time [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2376.3199999999997s)]
*  No, that's uh, that's uh free speech. Yeah [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2382.4799999999996s)]
*  Is the phalong gong on there like what's old elon doing to juice the phalong gong? I don't know. Let's find out [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2388.3999999999996s)]
*  Let's find out so uh speaking of uh, staying in our totalitarian regime, uh section here of this pod [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2394.24s)]
*  It was a terrifying night for people in ukraine, especially in kiev the capital [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2400.3999999999996s)]
*  Where local officials say they were subjected to the largest drone attack since the start of the war [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2404.16s)]
*  The ap said the attack lasted more than five hours and ukrainian air defenses luckily shot down more than 40 drones [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2408.8799999999997s)]
*  But it was a an attack timed for a celebration of kiev's founding [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2415.2799999999997s)]
*  In the third straight night of heavy bombardment so just absolutely terrifying for people who live there and no one slept in kiev for three days [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2420.2400000000002s)]
*  however [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2427.36s)]
*  At the same time moscow was attacked by drones on tuesday in the middle of the night [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2428.4s)]
*  The russian defense ministry said russian air defenses shot down five drones and caused three other severe off course causing minor damage to civilian buildings [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2432.96s)]
*  The kremlin has been downplaying these attacks ukraine denied it was them [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2441.0400000000004s)]
*  But did their usual kind of like [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2445.44s)]
*  Shitposting adjacent like you love to see it, you know, we expect more of this to happen kind of stuff [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2447.52s)]
*  Then it's hard to get a good read on public opinion in russia [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2453.3599999999997s)]
*  But there was a bbc report I heard today where they interviewed some sort of like random russian civilians who were near where this [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2456.16s)]
*  Explosions happened in moscow and they said uh the drone attack made them feel like things were not as calm and stable as they've been [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2462.48s)]
*  Led to believe in that a war that had once felt far away was reaching them close at home [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2469.2s)]
*  If that's the impact on russian public opinion, you have to think that these cross-border attacks are going to ramp up dramatically [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2475.04s)]
*  Absolutely, you know and we've been talking about this for almost every week, but it just keeps happening [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2482.0s)]
*  Clearly ukraine has made a decision to to do this [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2487.68s)]
*  and in this case, there are a couple things that are noteworthy about it first is that [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2491.2s)]
*  Assuming they control the timing and some aspect of the ukrainian government or special services seems to control this thing [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2495.68s)]
*  Um [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2501.84s)]
*  They were being attacked in kiev and and so they're reciprocating in their minds, you know, we're going to therefore [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2503.04s)]
*  uh [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2508.64s)]
*  Time our response to those attacks. The other thing that's interesting in both directions is use of drones, right because [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2509.6s)]
*  It's a lot cheaper [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2515.92s)]
*  To just arm some kamikaze drones and send them somewhere than it is to like have a bunch of you know [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2517.52s)]
*  Precision guided missiles, you know, and so already we've seen russians [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2523.84s)]
*  In parkas are having trouble with ukrainian air defenses as we've given them patriot batteries and things like that [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2528.5s)]
*  Pivot to like first these iranian kamikaze drones and then the russians must be just turning these things out [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2533.7000000000003s)]
*  And so increasingly you see this kind of [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2538.98s)]
*  These drone attacks which are can terrorize but they can't destroy kind of as much [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2541.38s)]
*  Uh infrastructure, but that shows you we're in this new world of drone warfare [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2545.76s)]
*  um, you know, we we got accustomed to thinking about drones and you and I were obviously a part of this as he's [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2549.94s)]
*  Sophisticated targeted assassination potentially super precise. Yeah. Yeah [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2556.08s)]
*  Now's the opposite. It's now swarms of like model airplanes. That's right. And by the way [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2561.06s)]
*  Ai is coming down the pipe. We haven't talked about the killer robots yet [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2566.18s)]
*  You know, this could all be ai run within, you know, relatively short period of time [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2568.66s)]
*  And so the ukrainians have found this kind of cost-effective asymmetric way to strike back [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2573.3s)]
*  And the question is what happens if that actually starts killing people or destroying things instead of just [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2577.46s)]
*  You know launching these kind of campaigns of see what we can do [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2582.42s)]
*  Because you have to think at some point it will [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2586.26s)]
*  I think on russian public opinion, you know [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2589.54s)]
*  there've been a couple of like surveys recently that indicated that if you kind of [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2591.2200000000003s)]
*  If you run a net through telegram, which is the main russian social media app you find kind of growing frustration with casualties [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2596.18s)]
*  You also see these nationalist voices like to putin's right [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2603.54s)]
*  Calling into question like even after this episode [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2607.3799999999997s)]
*  Oh, do we control our own airspace? How can't stop this? [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2610.2599999999998s)]
*  I think it is a problem for the kremlin and that too will reinforce ukraine's desire to do it [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2613.7s)]
*  Which again reminds you that the more this war goes on [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2620.1s)]
*  The more there's risks of things escalating of something happening that triggers a response that triggers a counter response [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2624.1s)]
*  um, and once you get into this kind of stuff, I you know, I think [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2630.5s)]
*  Um, you just don't know [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2634.7400000000002s)]
*  What pudin might do at some point? Yeah and more, you know innocent people potentially dying in moscow and kiev and everywhere else [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2636.7400000000002s)]
*  Did you see the ukrainians released? [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2641.38s)]
*  another [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2643.78s)]
*  More footage of a drone boat [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2645.3s)]
*  Attacking another you know russian military vessel like i'm basically just hitting the side of it and exploding and the video is dark [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2648.32s)]
*  I mean, there's things are everywhere things everywhere now in the russians as as they've depleted their stockpiles [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2653.94s)]
*  They're going to be turning more to these kind of crude drone type attacks as well [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2659.62s)]
*  So it's a different, you know kind of war on the one end [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2663.8599999999997s)]
*  You have this kind of world war one style front line with artillery [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2666.58s)]
*  But then on the other end you have all this mechanized and drone type warfare. It's it's I mean, i'd say it's interesting [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2670.02s)]
*  Except it's tragic. Yeah, it's absolutely tragic [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2676.66s)]
*  The other thing that came out of russia was the russian interior ministry issued an arrest warrant for south carolina senator lindy graham [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2679.22s)]
*  In response to comments graham made while in kiev last week for a meeting with president zelensky [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2687.22s)]
*  The weird thing about this [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2692.02s)]
*  Is that russia was mad about a total misrepresentation of what graham said president zelensky's office released a misleadingly edited video of graham speaking [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2693.7s)]
*  Which combines separate comments when he one time he said the russians are dying [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2702.98s)]
*  Uh, and he also said the ukraine assistance was the best money we've ever spent obviously the two are linked in some sense [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2708.18s)]
*  But he didn't put them together in in one sentence [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2715.62s)]
*  Regardless, uh, you know [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2719.3599999999997s)]
*  Despite the ukrainians basically getting him an international arrest warrant graham seems cool with it all he tweeted [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2721.62s)]
*  Quote to know that my commitment to ukraine has drawn the ire of putin's regime brings me immense joy [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2726.98s)]
*  And quote I will wear the arrest warrant issued by putin's corrupt and immoral government as a badge of honor [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2732.02s)]
*  I'm tempted to make a joke about a prisoner exchange, but I won't ben because we're much more mature than that [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2738.1s)]
*  But um, I do think we should just sort of admire how [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2742.74s)]
*  Perfectly stupid and shitty. This is like miss lindsky's office [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2746.3399999999997s)]
*  Should not have misleadingly edited this video and made it look like graham was like [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2750.34s)]
*  Thrilled that russian civilians are dying the russians overreact [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2755.6200000000003s)]
*  Graham is cool with it because it helps him politically like rinse repeat. It's just a weird everything about this is dumb. Um, [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2759.78s)]
*  You're right because like the way that quote was edited and we've all watched these videos like zelensky's social media [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2766.98s)]
*  Like chernsey's ad and one will be about like, you know [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2772.98s)]
*  uh shawn penn came to see me and then the next one is like [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2775.54s)]
*  Lindsey graham talking about dying russians. Right boris johnson high-five. Yeah, and um [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2779.6200000000003s)]
*  And I mean, I don't want to diminish it and then a lot of it is like very poignant and powerful leadership from zelensky [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2784.1800000000003s)]
*  But there is a trolling aspect to it for sure and juxtaposing [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2791.1400000000003s)]
*  You know, the russians are dying best investment we made the russian narrative is oh, they're committing war crimes [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2795.06s)]
*  Just like we are so they're all we're all war criminals and everybody does it and and that's that's what they that's what they're trying [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2799.94s)]
*  To foster and I think you should try to deny them that so the reason I critique the ukrainians is [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2805.54s)]
*  You don't want to write their talking points for them. And if their talking points are just pure whataboutism [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2812.34s)]
*  Don't do that. But the other thing I will say tommy is like [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2817.54s)]
*  as we talked about like I was on the first sanctions list in [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2820.74s)]
*  2014 with [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2824.64s)]
*  a friend of the pod, uh, worldo [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2826.18s)]
*  At least worldo spouse, uh dan five because I know how he's a yeah avid worldo. Um [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2829.06s)]
*  the one thing I have not I which won't do is the like [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2834.7400000000002s)]
*  You know twitter bio like sanctioned by putin like blocks by trump. Yeah, yeah, because the reality is like this is no fucking [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2838.9s)]
*  Impact on my life whatsoever. No, no one wants to go to every single person who's been sanctioned with the I guess exception of if [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2846.82s)]
*  There's some business person who had some investments there like [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2852.5s)]
*  Your life has not changed is not a big deal. It's not a big inconvenience [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2855.46s)]
*  Lindsey graham is not going to be arrested on some inner pole red notice next year [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2859.72s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. So there's something so dumb about it because like [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2865.4s)]
*  As you said like everybody gets to perform the russians get to the ukrainians get to perform about the dying russians [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2868.68s)]
*  The russians perform about the american war criminals and then the american politician performs [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2874.12s)]
*  Uh about like look at how great I am because I got you know sanctioned or arrested. It's just [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2879.16s)]
*  This is a sideshow and it's fucking stupid and absolutely and again, I just [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2884.6s)]
*  The mutual congratulation of people on the sanctions list that russia puts out like there are now like thousands of these people on this list [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2888.92s)]
*  Like you know, it's not that special anymore to be on so many. It's not that ever was the weirdest list of people [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2895.16s)]
*  It's the weird fucking list. Yeah, I get it. Um a couple more things before we get the interview [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2900.12s)]
*  So ben on monday the president of poland said he would sign into law a bill that creates a commission [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2903.88s)]
*  That is ostensibly designed to investigate russian influence in poland [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2909.64s)]
*  But which in practice could allow the polish government to punish its rivals including sentencing individuals to have 10-year bans on serving in political office [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2913.6400000000003s)]
*  Uh, the polish opposition is calling this proposal lex tusk because they believe it's a law [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2922.1200000000003s)]
*  Specifically targeting the former prime minister donald tusk ahead of elections later this year [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2927.2200000000003s)]
*  The new commission would investigate the period between 2022 and 2007 tusk became prime minister in 2007 and served there until 2014 [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2931.56s)]
*  Interesting coincidence on the timing there during that time poland signed a number of energy deals with russia those could hypothetically, you know [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2940.12s)]
*  Be looked at by the commission [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2946.52s)]
*  Which could decide they were two pro-russian [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2948.3599999999997s)]
*  And dan tusker as associates from holding political office. So [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2950.92s)]
*  Experts say this bill violates poland's constitution [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2954.12s)]
*  But president duda is saying no well look look at the conversation happening in the u.s [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2957.0s)]
*  Right now look at the conversation about russian interference in european capitals. That's why I support this commission [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2962.04s)]
*  It's the same conversation they're having [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2967.56s)]
*  um [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2969.72s)]
*  The eu however is saying [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2970.84s)]
*  Uh, they might punish poland if the law is enacted duda also says he wants to create a similar entity at the european union [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2973.24s)]
*  But in response the eu says they might punish poland if poland enacts this law [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2979.72s)]
*  The u.s is criticizing their proposal. So ben, I mean [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2985.24s)]
*  This just strikes me as a very similar playbook that we've seen before [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2989.32s)]
*  you have [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2993.0s)]
*  Uh, one of you have countries that reference say the u.s war on terror [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2994.44s)]
*  As a way to crack down on muslim communities or civil liberties. It seems like duda is taking a very cynical [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=2998.44s)]
*  But maybe politically clever tact here and saying oh no. No, we're just having a conversation about russian interference like you guys are [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3004.84s)]
*  That's why I need this commission that could potentially lock out my number one rival in the parliamentary elections this fall [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3011.56s)]
*  Yeah, I I mean what's interesting is that the polish government has kind of been going in the urban direction for a while. Definitely [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3018.12s)]
*  Um, it's you know, it clearly has ambitions to be kind of a single-party national state intimidate their opponents and control the media [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3022.92s)]
*  all the rest of it what's [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3030.2000000000003s)]
*  What's complicated this whole dynamic is poland has obviously been absolutely central [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3032.2000000000003s)]
*  to the war in ukraine [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3037.16s)]
*  Most if not, you know nearly all of the assistance that flows into ukraine militarily goes through poland poland is hosting [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3039.7200000000003s)]
*  millions of ukrainian refugees [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3046.36s)]
*  Zelensky very close to that government for for necessary reasons [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3048.58s)]
*  And so it makes it more uncomfortable and awkward for there to be this divide between europe and and and and warsaw [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3052.84s)]
*  The polish military by the way is getting much stronger [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3061.08s)]
*  The us is beginning to station [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3064.04s)]
*  permanently [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3066.7599999999998s)]
*  Military resources in poland so there's a lot going on here [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3068.12s)]
*  And I think part of what duda is doing is trying to you know [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3071.72s)]
*  Use the cover of poland's growing influence and importance to see how far you can push the envelope now with respect to the law [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3074.12s)]
*  There are real questions and issues around [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3081.8s)]
*  russian interference in in in eastern european politics [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3085.4s)]
*  Center we talked about, you know serbia earlier. I don't doubt that there aren't legitimate reasons [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3088.92s)]
*  Why one might want to look at okay is russia trying to get influence in a place like poland but the way the law is crafted [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3094.52s)]
*  Doesn't look like that at all because why would you look at 2007? [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3101.32s)]
*  Why would you roll back the tape to 2007? You know like and create this extra judicial sort of entity exactly [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3104.6800000000003s)]
*  This is some earnest desire to just say like we need more tools to spot russian interference in our politics [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3110.2799999999997s)]
*  That'd be one thing but creating some extra judicial entity to like pick punishment from this massively large window is crazy [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3114.4399999999996s)]
*  Tusk the irony of this is like an anti-russian [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3121.64s)]
*  Pro european politician right just the fact that he presided over some energy deals wasn't like he was a russian asset or something [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3124.52s)]
*  No sort of standard merkel was presiding over is angela merkel like going to be punished in you know that context so [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3130.4399999999996s)]
*  I just this this does reek of that overreach and I think it's going to [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3136.76s)]
*  Again, the longer the war in ukraine goes on [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3141.56s)]
*  I think you'll start to see some tensions around things like this [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3144.36s)]
*  Definitely the the good news here ben is it does sound like you know [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3147.08s)]
*  There's going to have to be a review of the constitutionality of the law that seems like there will be a lot of international pressure [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3149.7200000000003s)]
*  On poland not to do this or to reform it in some way, but we'll see and we'll keep an eye on it [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3154.04s)]
*  um also on tuesday ben so [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3158.52s)]
*  Brazilian president lula da silva [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3160.76s)]
*  Hosted a meeting of all 12 countries in south america lula says he wants to talk about energy crime [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3162.84s)]
*  Possibly creating a regional currency to displace the u.s. Doll that's like all on the agenda [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3169.32s)]
*  lula [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3174.0400000000004s)]
*  I love lula. He first pulled together this group [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3175.6400000000003s)]
*  During his second term as president the meeting stopped for a while because you know [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3179.2400000000002s)]
*  He created this you know group of south american countries when it was all lefty leaders then a bunch of right wingers came in [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3183.32s)]
*  They hit pause on bringing this collection together [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3189.6400000000003s)]
*  But now that this meeting is back. It means that venezuelan president nicolas maduro is in [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3193.2400000000002s)]
*  Venezuela as we speak people who don't know maduro is the handpicked successor to former venezuelan president hugo chavez [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3198.7400000000002s)]
*  Madura had maduro had a one-on-one with lula ahead of this broader regional meeting [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3206.5200000000004s)]
*  He called on all south american countries to demand the united states lift sanctions on venezuela [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3210.92s)]
*  lula also criticized u.s sanctions saying it's inexplicable for a country to have 900 sanctions placed on it because another country doesn't [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3216.28s)]
*  Like it brazil isn't the only country thawing relations with maduro in venezuela chile recently nominated an ambassador to venezuela [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3222.52s)]
*  Um, so then you know back to our laughing about lula like i'm not surprised at all that he welcomed maduro into the country [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3230.68s)]
*  He's criticizing us. I mean this should be a day where we take some victory laps [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3236.36s)]
*  I think we called this one like three years ago when lula got out of prison that this would happen [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3240.92s)]
*  Yeah, well, but here's my question [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3245.0s)]
*  I mean, do you think that there's any chance that lula might be able to move the biden administration off the current hard line? [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3246.44s)]
*  Policy or that some of the the left is turned in latin america because again, you know like [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3253.48s)]
*  cuba policy [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3258.28s)]
*  Uh policy towards venezuela [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3259.6400000000003s)]
*  We're not seeing a ton of change in a more progressive way and I would like to [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3262.1200000000003s)]
*  I I think yeah, I think there's a there's a creative tension and constructive tension that can emerge between [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3266.84s)]
*  washington and lula, right? Um [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3273.54s)]
*  You know the u.s. Government's office is not going to sign on to everything that the blue wants [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3276.52s)]
*  but [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3281.32s)]
*  Um a lot of what the u.s. Does in latin america is stupid and self-defeating [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3282.28s)]
*  And our venezuelan policy is very high on that list [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3286.6s)]
*  So this policy that had general marco rubio [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3290.04s)]
*  And admiral john bolton at the forefront of it [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3294.1200000000003s)]
*  For those who don't remember of recognizing [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3297.6400000000003s)]
*  Someone who wasn't the president of venezuela juan guaido as president of venezuela on like a legal technicality [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3300.76s)]
*  kind of [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3306.04s)]
*  Pressuring slash bullying a bunch of countries in latin america and the europeans to follow suit [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3307.0800000000004s)]
*  And then sanctioning the hell out of venezuela [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3312.2000000000003s)]
*  Just one of the most catastrophic failures in u.s. Foreign policy in recent history in that [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3315.8s)]
*  Maduro is still there [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3319.96s)]
*  Juan guaido just snuck out of the country like literally snuck out of the country [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3322.6000000000004s)]
*  Right is now like last I saw hanging out up in northern virginia doing podcasts, you know, uh hanging out in florida, right? [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3326.2000000000003s)]
*  um [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3333.72s)]
*  Definitely not the president, you know [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3334.7599999999998s)]
*  and [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3337.56s)]
*  All the a lot of the right-wing governments that the u.s. Like, you know brought along on this have now been replaced by left-wing governments [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3338.52s)]
*  Clearly the u.s [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3345.08s)]
*  Has to make a pretty big shift in its venezuelan policy because the idea of like just not recognizing this guy as president doesn't work [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3346.04s)]
*  and meanwhile [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3353.88s)]
*  We've exacerbated humanitarian crisis there are there sanctions that has contributed significantly to people coming to our border [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3355.4s)]
*  A quarter of the population has left the country. We need some agreement that lifts a whole bunch of sanctions [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3362.12s)]
*  that sets an election [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3369.2400000000002s)]
*  That we promise to actually respect the results of you know, even if we don't like the results and hopefully we do like the results [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3371.7200000000003s)]
*  you know, but [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3378.12s)]
*  That allows for kind of a reset of what's happening between the u.s [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3379.64s)]
*  And latin america generally venezuela specifically. I would hope again that cuba is a part of this lula [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3383.64s)]
*  Also, I think it'd be a source of useful tension, but keep in mind [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3389.88s)]
*  A lot of people want to say oh, this is just lula. It's not it's it's lula in brazil. It's boric in chile [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3394.44s)]
*  It's petro in colombia. It's [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3400.6800000000003s)]
*  Amlo in mexico. It's like all the major latin american countries. There is nobody [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3403.1600000000003s)]
*  With us in this kind of weird [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3407.8s)]
*  Miami driven hardline policy [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3410.28s)]
*  it's so this [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3412.52s)]
*  Meeting somewhere in the middle between where we currently are more lulas is I think the smart way to go [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3415.08s)]
*  And honestly this kind of pressure is not the worst thing to try to shake that loose [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3420.52s)]
*  Yeah, like i'm sure opposition leaders in venezuela like juan cuido and leopoldo lopez are very good guys [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3425.0s)]
*  They have good intentions but to your point, I mean this diplomatic effort to sort of install them failed catastrophically [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3430.68s)]
*  On the other side, i'd love to hear lula talk be a little more critical of maduro's human rights record [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3436.52s)]
*  Okay, yeah, you're right [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3441.56s)]
*  Yeah, I sometimes get a little too frustrated the policy you're right to call that out and and i'm wrong to have not have noted [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3443.6400000000003s)]
*  I guess what i'd say though is and this is what I usually say about cuba [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3450.04s)]
*  Leopoldo lopez was not helped by that trump policy, right? You know juan cuido [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3453.88s)]
*  If you look at juan cuido's political standing when he became the speaker of the venezuelan national assembly and today [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3457.96s)]
*  It has suffered significantly right like like so I I wasn't I wouldn't take shots at the guy [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3464.6800000000003s)]
*  For his principles and courage i'd say the policy that he was made of course upon [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3471.8s)]
*  like hurt him and hurt the venezuelan people in the same way that [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3476.6000000000004s)]
*  cuban, you know, uh cuban opposition voices have suffered under the return to really aggressive sanctions we have to to to [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3479.8s)]
*  realize that efforts to kind of dislodge [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3488.7400000000002s)]
*  To well to regime change and latin america [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3492.52s)]
*  Is not an expression of support for human rights, even if that's like what it's dressed up as and wrapped up as you know [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3496.04s)]
*  Absolutely, and it's just it's harming a lot of innocent people. Yeah, this is where lulu's frustrated [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3501.24s)]
*  And also i'm sure from lulu's perspective. He's thinking like there's a trillion voices on the right criticizing [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3505.16s)]
*  This guy's human rights record. No one is saying what i'm saying, which is the sanctions are stupid [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3510.12s)]
*  Everyone should chill out respect the sovereignty, etc. Etc. So probably maybe overcorrects one direction [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3514.36s)]
*  Uh, whereas if you got him in a room, he would probably admit to you know, the complexity here [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3518.92s)]
*  But hopefully what a lulu could do that we can't is say hey, could you release some of these political prisoners? [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3522.92s)]
*  We've heard have been, you know treated horribly [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3527.16s)]
*  Maduro might be able to do that for a lula in a way that he would never do it [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3529.8799999999997s)]
*  Exactly demand it and so hopefully lulu can play that role too. Yes, but you know, he's often not been willing to well what he needs is [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3533.0s)]
*  uh incredibly a generational talented emissary like [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3540.74s)]
*  former british prime minister boris johnson [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3545.16s)]
*  Who uh, but he appears to be increasingly desperate to find I guess anyone who will listen to him [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3547.4799999999996s)]
*  Because he was recently in texas [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3553.08s)]
*  Yes meeting with conservative lawmakers and activists to lobby for support for ukraine and I guess his own relevance [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3555.56s)]
*  Uh johnson met with former president george w bush [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3562.28s)]
*  He met with texas governor greg abbot very relevant figure in geopolitics. What is he doing? You spoke to texas legislature [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3565.56s)]
*  Politico had a story on this they noted that surprisingly boris was not paid for his speaking engagements in dallas [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3571.08s)]
*  But don't worry. He'll get six figures to speak to an investment conference in las vegas [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3577.1600000000003s)]
*  Uh, then I missed this but did you see I guess last month? [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3582.04s)]
*  Trump did an interview with nijal farage, of course where he criticized boris johnson saying [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3585.24s)]
*  He was disappointed by boris's record in office and that boris was a bit on the liberal side for his taste [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3590.52s)]
*  Uh, what the fuck is this guy doing in texas [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3598.68s)]
*  just like he's on a [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3601.16s)]
*  Like we're in the world of carmen san diego like uh, he's on a global [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3603.08s)]
*  tour for relevancy [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3607.0s)]
*  um [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3608.68s)]
*  Because it's also like not even british conservatives [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3610.2799999999997s)]
*  I think would get a little uncomfortable with the stuff that's been coming out of texas legislature, you know [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3613.0s)]
*  Oh my god. Yeah, like they literally just passed a law banning [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3616.7599999999998s)]
*  Dei in higher education and they just impeached their own attorney general for being one of the most corrupt people in the entire country [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3621.16s)]
*  You know total abortion restrictions guns everywhere. This is not like something that would travel easily to the uk [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3627.7999999999997s)]
*  But he just clearly likes being applauded and feeling relevant. He wraps it all up in this ukraine message [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3634.2799999999997s)]
*  You know like such guess there's some bank shot if like the the the fascists in texas legislature [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3639.16s)]
*  Support ukraine maybe republicans will but like it's just he uses ukraine as a shield on everything, you know [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3644.84s)]
*  He did say like I saw him get up and say like keep cutting taxes or something. It's like [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3651.72s)]
*  I don't think that's the problem in texas that they have they have to they don't have a fucking income tax boris, you know, like [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3656.68s)]
*  so like [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3662.68s)]
*  Uh, he's not really getting briefed which is not a surprise. Um, yeah, it's so weird [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3663.72s)]
*  I mean listen like kirsteimer kicked jeremy corbyn out of the labor party rishi sunak needs to uh [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3668.2s)]
*  Grow some guts and kick boris johnson out of the tory bar. Oh man. Yeah, but that would you know [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3674.68s)]
*  Boris is probably still more like than rishi is that's the problem. Yeah, you're right. It would probably martyr him [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3679.7999999999997s)]
*  He just nailed himself to the cross. Yeah, and and he and you know, well [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3684.3599999999997s)]
*  Nigel's already out but uh [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3688.12s)]
*  Boris is exhausting. He's the worst uh last thing for the interview, uh ben just because we love to celebrate our australian friends [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3690.68s)]
*  I was listening to the bbc [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3696.28s)]
*  Uh world podcasts on the way into the office [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3697.88s)]
*  They did a story about a 51 year old australian man named marcus mcgowan [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3700.2000000000003s)]
*  Who was bitten by a saltwater crocodile while snorkeling at a resort in queensland and then managed to pry [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3704.36s)]
*  The crocodile's jaws off of his own head and then fight off a subsequent attack [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3710.92s)]
*  The guy I think said had a quote was something like look I was in the wrong place at the wrong time [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3717.8s)]
*  You're damn right. You are apparently earlier this month [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3721.4s)]
*  The remains of a fisherman were found inside a different 13 foot crocodile [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3723.72s)]
*  There's been a resurgence of these saltwater crocs in the area because I think they outlawed hunting for them [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3727.88s)]
*  So australians tougher than you think yeah [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3733.32s)]
*  I mean, uh some crocodile dundee shit right there. That's like a jaws sequel right there, right? [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3737.08s)]
*  Like uh in in an ip world where like people need you know, like you you could remake jaws with a saltwater croc [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3741.7999999999997s)]
*  What was that crocodile? Uh kind of horrorish movie lake placid maybe yeah. Yeah. Yeah [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3748.2799999999997s)]
*  It's pretty good. It's like a giant croc. I I think we need like and this would have to be set in australia [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3753.16s)]
*  Obviously definitely no doubt because then you have sweet accents and stuff. I don't know about the hunting [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3758.6s)]
*  Uh, usually i'm for hunting restrictions, but this one I don't know [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3763.08s)]
*  Uh, I might I might want to see a little more hunting. Yeah, I would be good with hunting man eating crocodiles [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3767.08s)]
*  I guess uh, okay 11 feet two think how long that is a big fucking massive massive. All right [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=3773.88s)]

*  And more recently together 10 choices for a better now. Welcome back to the show. It's great to see you [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4055.26s)]
*  Hi tommy. It's great to be back. We were just chatting before we started that we were hoping it would be [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4061.02s)]
*  Slightly happier circumstances. We're of course talking about the election in turkey on sunday turkish president tayyip erdogan won one reelection [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4066.54s)]
*  With 52 of the vote. This is the second round of voting [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4074.7s)]
*  After the first round, uh where no candidate got 50 of the vote which led to a runoff [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4078.38s)]
*  Before the first round of voting [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4084.38s)]
*  There was a sense of hope [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4086.78s)]
*  Uh that erdogan's main opponent an opposition leader named kamal kilich turulu might actually win [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4088.46s)]
*  Uh that erdogan might be punished by voters for the government's disastrous response to the earthquake for example [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4095.82s)]
*  Do you think that those early hopes were maybe based on false information or naive or did something change? [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4103.42s)]
*  I mean, how did erdogan seal the deal here? [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4108.62s)]
*  Uh, well first of all, uh when we're talking about turkey is not completely correct to take these numbers too seriously [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4111.9s)]
*  During the last decade millions of syrian refugees were accepted as citizens [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4121.34s)]
*  Uh on the condition that they're going to vote for everyone simple as that i'm talking about millions. So it's like a quite a percentage [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4129.34s)]
*  Uh, secondly, there is massive election fraud [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4137.66s)]
*  That is also a case. I'm like it's almost traditional in turkey. It is so normal that you know, the opposition party opposition coalition [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4142.0599999999995s)]
*  Uh, it's revealing its program how to protect the ballot boxes from the government [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4150.54s)]
*  Um, and then thirdly we have to keep in mind [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4156.780000000001s)]
*  That this is not a competition on equal conditions [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4160.54s)]
*  At all zero we're talking about a party state [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4164.620000000001s)]
*  Well, it doesn't look like north korea maybe from outside but actually de facto. It's almost north korea. There is no media [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4168.54s)]
*  Uh mainstream media, which is independent. It is all controlled by the government [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4176.38s)]
*  And also if you speak against the government even on twitter, they find you and they take you to the prison [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4181.98s)]
*  So we're talking about [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4190.06s)]
*  Such circumstances [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4192.3s)]
*  So yeah, of course there was hope [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4194.06s)]
*  You know in the first round [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4198.14s)]
*  but [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4200.7s)]
*  Also, it's interesting to point out [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4201.5s)]
*  To emphasize that erdogan did not win in the first round after 20 some years [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4204.54s)]
*  This was the first election that he didn't win [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4210.86s)]
*  um, so [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4213.74s)]
*  Second round was far more difficult because we knew that there will be new kinds of [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4215.42s)]
*  Cheating new kinds of deception and so on and he also used [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4221.5s)]
*  Uh fake, you know editing of videos he used [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4225.58s)]
*  Dark propaganda all the ugly things you can imagine or cannot imagine [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4231.66s)]
*  So, you know i'm coming from a complicated country and people like me who come from [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4237.42s)]
*  Complicated countries. We have a habit of breaking down things for western audiences [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4242.36s)]
*  To others to make them understand the scale of the situation [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4247.58s)]
*  Scale of the problem. So here's what turkey is now imagine trump with a political genius [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4251.099999999999s)]
*  for 20 years [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4258.219999999999s)]
*  plus [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4260.219999999999s)]
*  And to add to that and on the unending process of brexit that kind of polarization [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4261.26s)]
*  Um, so we were, you know [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4268.700000000001s)]
*  fighting against odds [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4272.700000000001s)]
*  and [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4274.700000000001s)]
*  We didn't win. I don't think we lost really the opposition because half of the country despite all the oppression [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4275.740000000001s)]
*  Despite all the fear of empire despite all the [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4282.46s)]
*  Suppression on every level they still said no to this regime and we're talking about 20 years [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4286.219999999999s)]
*  I you know, I don't want create the new generation and even that new generation did not totally [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4292.78s)]
*  Say yes to him. So I think [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4298.86s)]
*  There's still hope there [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4301.58s)]
*  Yeah, there's hope. I mean it's funny ben and I were talking about this election, uh [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4303.5s)]
*  As compared to the recent election in hungary and you had opposition parties coalesce around a single figure [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4307.58s)]
*  And you know in turkey okeyless. Girola was seen as sort of the anti erdogan [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4316.3s)]
*  He would record videos from his kitchen table literally. He was this sort of like low-key [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4321.099999999999s)]
*  Technocratic guy and maybe that was seen as the answer now. I'm seeing some analysts say well [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4326.92s)]
*  Maybe he wasn't exciting enough or inspirational enough didn't rally the base the way erdogan did [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4332.0599999999995s)]
*  Do you have an opinion on whether he was the right candidate for this moment? [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4336.94s)]
*  Just as we sort of think about I don't know how to tackle people like erdogan in the future. Um [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4341.9s)]
*  Losing against erdogan in these circumstances does not make a leader the wrong candidate [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4346.94s)]
*  To put it very plain [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4352.94s)]
*  He he was not the first choice for many. He wasn't the exciting choice. He wasn't the you know, the guy who [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4355.0199999999995s)]
*  Created enthusiasm so to speak but then what he did was amazing throughout the campaign trail [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4362.86s)]
*  it was [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4369.0199999999995s)]
*  full of [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4370.46s)]
*  deeper understanding of humanity [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4371.66s)]
*  it was speaking to the [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4374.0599999999995s)]
*  You know [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4376.62s)]
*  basic moral values of the country [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4377.58s)]
*  It was speaking to the core that made the country [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4380.3s)]
*  uh a country basically [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4384.38s)]
*  Turkey is a very complicated complex problematic country and in such a polarized society [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4387.26s)]
*  He managed to bring [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4393.9s)]
*  the eternal enemies together [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4395.5s)]
*  That takes a lot of political charisma, I think if you're talking about charisma [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4398.22s)]
*  um and also [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4403.18s)]
*  I think personally he reached to a political nirvana or something. He's super zen [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4405.9s)]
*  uh the the attacks that he had to suffer [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4412.78s)]
*  uh the bullshit he had to go through [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4416.46s)]
*  and [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4419.82s)]
*  And he did it with such elegance and grace [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4420.62s)]
*  I personally in awe of him and many people thousands and thousands of people on twitter [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4424.06s)]
*  On the election night when the votes were counting [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4429.66s)]
*  They said the same thing [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4432.94s)]
*  Thank you [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4434.86s)]
*  Whatever you've done. It doesn't matter what the result is. Thank you because we've seen a politician [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4435.9s)]
*  Who is embracing the entire country? [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4441.58s)]
*  Who is showing us what politics can be how elegant and graceful and full of love can be? [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4444.22s)]
*  As you know or you might know uh, not know his um, you know sign was this heart shape with hands [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4449.58s)]
*  It's not I know it looks really really cheesy [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4457.58s)]
*  But we're talking about a country [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4460.86s)]
*  Where lack of love is so solid that it became fatal [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4464.46s)]
*  I'm talking about basic human love [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4469.9s)]
*  So it was a very important statement and he carried out that statement throughout the campaign [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4472.94s)]
*  Despite all the attack that we got [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4479.18s)]
*  with amazing stamina [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4482.3s)]
*  so, um, I think we owe him a lot of uh [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4485.660000000001s)]
*  appreciation [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4491.400000000001s)]
*  For keeping his cool on such a level [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4492.860000000001s)]
*  You know imagine trump again with political genius and you're keeping the you know [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4497.42s)]
*  Going high as they go low. I mean like he was the embodied [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4503.18s)]
*  Version of that's uh [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4507.42s)]
*  of that [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4510.0599999999995s)]
*  Sentence, I think yeah [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4511.34s)]
*  And you know you mentioned sarada one had support from all over, you know the media institutions [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4513.179999999999s)]
*  Decades of patronage. He was also able to get financial support [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4519.9s)]
*  And loans from countries like the saudis the uae qatar russia to stave off economic problems and then [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4523.82s)]
*  Take that cash and essentially [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4531.179999999999s)]
*  Hand out money [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4533.26s)]
*  To people in the run-up to the election. How important do you think this? [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4534.860000000001s)]
*  You know autocrat creditor network was to err duan's ultimate success. Absolutely very important [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4539.18s)]
*  Many people think that it's only this emotional part of the situation like you know [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4547.18s)]
*  The voters the masses becoming one with the leader and so on which is very very [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4551.740000000001s)]
*  prominent, but also i don't since he came to power like any [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4557.320000000001s)]
*  Leader of that kind he created a web of political money [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4563.42s)]
*  So the money that he collected from now and from here and there through really, you know dark [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4568.54s)]
*  ways [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4575.58s)]
*  He trickled down to his smallest supporter [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4576.700000000001s)]
*  So this web actually became his security web to keep him in power [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4580.700000000001s)]
*  So when people were you know, what were voting for him or when they were fighting for him? [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4585.66s)]
*  They were actually fighting for their own livelihoods [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4592.06s)]
*  This is very important to understand because when these leaders come to power what they [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4596.14s)]
*  Produce as a political system as a societal system [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4602.22s)]
*  becomes [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4606.22s)]
*  unbeatable quite quickly actually [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4607.8s)]
*  So that was very important and then you know when you look around the world [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4611.660000000001s)]
*  Putin or ban [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4616.06s)]
*  Erdogan monsonaro trump or several leaders like that more than india [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4618.14s)]
*  They run their countries like a grocery shop [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4625.820000000001s)]
*  You don't really know if they have a foreign policy. You don't really know if they have a financial policy [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4629.660000000001s)]
*  There's this one man who knows everything and we don't really learn what's going on behind the doors [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4635.740000000001s)]
*  They go and meet somewhere as erdogan and putin does for instance [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4641.660000000001s)]
*  They decide things and then it becomes countries policy about a certain issue [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4646.3s)]
*  so [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4652.06s)]
*  I think it's [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4653.1s)]
*  Countries run by autocratic leaders become like mafia mobs and these mafia mobs are making agreements with each other [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4654.620000000001s)]
*  and we are following [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4663.34s)]
*  Their agreements or disagreements in some cases. Yeah, I totally agree [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4665.26s)]
*  I mean you i've heard you say that [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4669.58s)]
*  This victory for erdogan will essentially lead to fully formed fascism in turkey. I've seen other analysts say that [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4673.18s)]
*  Five years from now turkey is going to look a lot more like china [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4680.3s)]
*  Than sort of a western, you know country. Can you help us understand? [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4684.38s)]
*  How he'll do that or how that might happen in practice? Unfortunately [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4689.02s)]
*  It will be more complicated than that. I'm [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4693.98s)]
*  you know [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4697.26s)]
*  trying to [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4698.38s)]
*  Conceptualize it with some sort of dubaiization [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4701.16s)]
*  It's going to be like something like between dubai and afghanistan. Let's say [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4705.18s)]
*  afghanistan in terms of total destruction of culture [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4710.6s)]
*  and freedom of speech [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4715.82s)]
*  dubaiization in terms of [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4718.68s)]
*  No citizenship the sense of citizenship will be lost. It is already very much damaged because [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4720.78s)]
*  Erdogan in every opportunity he has he said the same thing, you know [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4727.74s)]
*  He insinuated the same thing at least saying that you know, there are citizens who are my supporters and there are the others [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4732.78s)]
*  And the others. Hmm. You don't know what happens with the others because they are now enemies [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4740.14s)]
*  For many people in the western societies, it's not easy to imagine this [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4747.1s)]
*  And they imagine autocracy or fascism as an abstract [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4753.26s)]
*  concept whereas when you [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4757.66s)]
*  You know when you talk about fascism in daily life, you mean something like this. For instance, you get divorced [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4760.22s)]
*  You are you want to get divorced? [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4766.46s)]
*  And then you want to have the upper hand in the divorce case and then you suddenly come up with this idea [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4768.860000000001s)]
*  Oh, my husband has been criticizing Erdogan and here you go [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4774.78s)]
*  You know you get the upper hand or [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4779.82s)]
*  suddenly [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4782.46s)]
*  Let's say you know smaller things like, you know, your neighbor is doing this massive noise and you go to the police [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4783.9s)]
*  And the police looks at you and you don't look like a akp supporter and your you know neighbor is akp supporter [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4791.259999999999s)]
*  You know, there is like very very tiny chance that you get what you deserve [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4798.78s)]
*  So imagine this on every level of life on every bit of life. That is how [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4804.379999999999s)]
*  the daily life is controlled [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4810.7s)]
*  uh how how [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4813.099999999999s)]
*  You know how fascism? [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4815.099999999999s)]
*  Infuses into every bit of life [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4817.16s)]
*  Um, so it will be more and more like this on the night of the election [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4819.98s)]
*  This was a big topic on the on twitter [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4824.94s)]
*  in turkey [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4828.22s)]
*  and many people [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4829.34s)]
*  started to close their accounts on twitter on instagram on youtube [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4831.26s)]
*  Because they're afraid now [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4837.0199999999995s)]
*  And even the street, you know interviewers youtube, you know independent [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4839.26s)]
*  Reporters and so on [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4844.52s)]
*  There's you know, they were showing people they do not want to talk anymore. They're going away [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4846.22s)]
*  so this is how it is the fear will become more and more present and [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4851.5s)]
*  People will be more and more silent. However [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4857.9800000000005s)]
*  You know, there's [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4861.740000000001s)]
*  good chance [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4863.18s)]
*  that in two years [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4864.780000000001s)]
*  The massive economic crisis that turkey is going through [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4867.179999999999s)]
*  can damage [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4870.78s)]
*  the image of erdogan [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4873.099999999999s)]
*  And even his devotees might be saying enough is enough [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4875.42s)]
*  Then we'll see i'm like, I think turkey is going to have [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4880.3s)]
*  Witness like or experience two interesting years two and a half years. I'm expecting that no scientific evidence [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4883.9s)]
*  But this is my feeling that's going to be [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4891.0199999999995s)]
*  Um [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4893.5s)]
*  Less than five years. That's my point with the sort of massive inflation [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4894.700000000001s)]
*  Uh and erdogan just pumping money into the economy to sort of get through today and not sort of thinking about the longer terms [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4898.700000000001s)]
*  That's what you're looking at. Yeah, also not only that there's something deeper than that [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4905.26s)]
*  Erdogan gathered all the conservative [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4910.9400000000005s)]
*  Forces to stay in power and these conservative forces include turkish hezbollah [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4914.540000000001s)]
*  Which is absolutely a criminal organization [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4920.72s)]
*  You know, they are famous for I don't know the english word for that but like, you know, they're famous for certain kind of torture [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4926.08s)]
*  Killings and so on and they're radical islamists and now they have mps [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4933.9s)]
*  in the parliament [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4940.56s)]
*  So we will see if the fundamental contract of turkish society [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4942.0s)]
*  Can accommodate this kind of politics in the parliament or not [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4947.7s)]
*  Because this is a country that has been secular [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4954.42s)]
*  at least nominally [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4958.82s)]
*  And that has been democratic nominally [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4960.82s)]
*  And now there is a clear [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4964.98s)]
*  you know [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4968.5s)]
*  change of direction [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4969.78s)]
*  to ultra [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4971.38s)]
*  Is ultra nationalism and radical islamism [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4973.86s)]
*  It was there already since 20 years and new generation [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4977.78s)]
*  Was born as erdogan calls them that cling to their religion and roths [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4981.9400000000005s)]
*  um [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4987.46s)]
*  but this time it is more serious and people are [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4988.42s)]
*  Veering for the lives of their daughters for instance [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4993.3s)]
*  Because we are talking about this hezbollah turkish hezbollah now turning to a party becoming mps they want [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=4997.62s)]
*  The the single women to be owned [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5005.700000000001s)]
*  Adopted so to speak like pets [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5010.72s)]
*  um [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5013.46s)]
*  So yeah, it's going to be a interesting time for turkey not in a good way obviously, but yeah [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5014.34s)]
*  Yeah, well that's sounds terrifying. I mean the other [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5021.06s)]
*  Evolution I think we're kind of watching in real time is in in washington and sort of the [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5024.580000000001s)]
*  ongoing reassessment of the u.s turkey relationship [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5029.780000000001s)]
*  It was you know, then I were talking about how you know in 2009 we went with obama [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5032.740000000001s)]
*  Uh to turkey, you know sort of seen as this success story that was worth highlighting [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5037.46s)]
*  Now you have the biden administration essentially openly [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5042.5s)]
*  rooting against erdogan [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5045.92s)]
*  In this election and now they have to figure out how to work with him [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5048.900000000001s)]
*  Biden wants sweden into nato. There's this debate going on about selling turkey f-16 fighter jets sort of this on again off again sale [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5051.86s)]
*  What do you think erdogan wants out of? [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5060.34s)]
*  The u.s turkey relationship and are there things you think the u.s can or should do? [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5063.22s)]
*  To moderate his behavior or create some guardrails two things [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5068.58s)]
*  Uh, unfortunately that enthusiasm coming from united states and western block [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5073.7s)]
*  For erdogan turned him into a so-called global leader [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5079.38s)]
*  Uh, and I remember 10 years how those audiences [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5084.58s)]
*  Uploaded him, you know boosted his ego [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5089.28s)]
*  And so on so I was I really expected biden administration showing the same enthusiasm for koulishtarova to be honest [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5092.58s)]
*  Because you know, yes, we have this problem of erdogan, but we didn't on our own create this problem [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5101.7s)]
*  It was you know, erdogan was shown as the exemplary leader for the muslim world [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5108.1s)]
*  And he was really vetted for it for that position [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5114.26s)]
*  and united states [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5119.06s)]
*  Administration had a lot in that [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5121.44s)]
*  This is the first thing [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5125.22s)]
*  um the second thing is [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5127.38s)]
*  um [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5129.86s)]
*  Let me put it this way these leaders including putin. Oh, you know erdogan [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5130.9s)]
*  Whoever you want to this ilk of [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5136.34s)]
*  politicians they thrive on the moral [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5140.16s)]
*  Fragility to put it politely of the western societies western governments [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5145.36s)]
*  Uh european union as you know has been [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5153.139999999999s)]
*  Making agreements with erdogan to keep the refugees in turkey and they were literally paying for each person [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5158.0199999999995s)]
*  That money we don't know where that money [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5165.38s)]
*  Went, I mean like I don't got that money and we don't know how it was used. That's one thing [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5167.86s)]
*  but then [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5172.82s)]
*  You know, can you imagine european union being absolutely enthusiastic? [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5174.1s)]
*  Uh for koulishtarova coming to power when they know that they cannot do the same [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5179.38s)]
*  um indecent [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5184.74s)]
*  You know deal with that's a good point [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5187.78s)]
*  Yeah, so [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5190.5s)]
*  You know f16s [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5192.18s)]
*  Are no less indecent my point is that [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5194.42s)]
*  So if you want democracy to win [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5197.7s)]
*  Excuse me [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5200.96s)]
*  You have to cooperate with democratic forces. You cannot do like, you know, we want democracy [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5202.26s)]
*  But also if they don't have democracy we can go on business as usual [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5207.46s)]
*  No, it doesn't work like that [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5212.5s)]
*  I mean like i'm not expecting united states to uh, you know [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5214.74s)]
*  Rescue turkish people from this anti-democratic government [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5218.74s)]
*  No, we can do it on our own. However [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5223.3s)]
*  They have to keep in mind that [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5226.66s)]
*  You know collapse of turkish democracy the total final collapse of turkish democracy will have far more [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5229.22s)]
*  uh bigger consequences more far more deeper consequences than syria falling down [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5236.26s)]
*  um [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5243.86s)]
*  Turkey is now the front line [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5245.06s)]
*  of [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5248.18s)]
*  fight against the new authoritarianism or new fascism [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5249.14s)]
*  If you lose it there in that front line, just you can be sure the next front line is [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5254.9800000000005s)]
*  central europe or [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5260.900000000001s)]
*  Western yeah, no, I I that's a really good point. I think [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5263.62s)]
*  The us relationship with places like turkey has often been um [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5268.42s)]
*  you know the long-term goals are undercut by [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5272.9800000000005s)]
*  Short-term priorities that are usually revolve around fighting terrorism in some sort of nebulous sense in these security relationships [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5276.26s)]
*  Which lead the u.s to do things like I don't know sell the saudis billion dollars worth of military hardware [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5282.9s)]
*  While they you know suppress women for example [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5289.14s)]
*  Yeah, when it comes to women, which one is uh more expensive? Okay, the nukes so let's go [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5293.54s)]
*  Yeah, we have to uh think a little more long-term well speaking of long-term I mean the final question for you [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5300.98s)]
*  Uh, we in the u.s. You might have noticed. We're trying to fend off an autocrat [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5307.7s)]
*  Once we return to office [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5313.3s)]
*  Yeah, we've got kind of a low-key [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5315.62s)]
*  Technocrat named joe biden in office now who's doing a pretty good job on a lot a number of fronts [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5318.16s)]
*  But you know his approval is stuck. He's got this sort of bombastic [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5323.54s)]
*  Uh venal donald trump waiting in the wings any advice for us on how to approach an election like this [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5327.72s)]
*  I give the same advice to british people as well because you two [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5334.4400000000005s)]
*  Countries on the on each side of the pond you have the same kind of funny hair in your life [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5338.9s)]
*  As a political threat that's why actually my advice is not to laugh too much because you're laughing because they have funny hair [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5346.36s)]
*  Hey [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5354.44s)]
*  Yeah [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5356.679999999999s)]
*  But I think we have to be careful about our laughter when we laugh how we laugh to whom we love and to which with whom we laugh [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5358.04s)]
*  together [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5366.34s)]
*  um [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5367.639999999999s)]
*  Because we you know, once you start laughing at them [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5369.16s)]
*  You don't know when it becomes too serious that you cannot laugh anymore or you're laughing on your own [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5373.72s)]
*  um, I think the united states [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5378.92s)]
*  Is better in taking it seriously than britain to be honest, this is my observation [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5382.2s)]
*  uh still [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5389.5599999999995s)]
*  Not enough political energy [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5394.599999999999s)]
*  And determination is put into how to fight against anti-democratic forces [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5398.36s)]
*  There is this belief [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5405.88s)]
*  That we can still fix it if we get rid of this guy get rid of that guy that leader and so [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5407.72s)]
*  No, unfortunately, it's not the case [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5413.320000000001s)]
*  Imagine trump only four years [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5415.56s)]
*  He was in power and now women in united states are in big trouble because of the abortion issue [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5418.360000000001s)]
*  Because he did just one, you know appointment and then everything is gone [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5424.76s)]
*  so [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5429.4800000000005s)]
*  What what they are doing the damage that they're creating? [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5430.52s)]
*  Is far serious than we think so we have to be [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5434.6s)]
*  One careful but second we have to do the boring job like, you know making fun of trump is easy [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5439.24s)]
*  Attacking him on twitter is easy [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5446.52s)]
*  What is more boring yet difficult is to follow which appointments he did? [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5448.84s)]
*  To follow what where he's going what he's really saying and to take him seriously. Yeah long-term structural work of defending a democracy and uh, [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5454.6s)]
*  And party building uh, etch a thank you so much for for joining the show [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5464.12s)]

*  Okay, great. Yeah, give him a show somewhere. I don't care where it is exactly [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5488.92s)]

*  A fantastic interview as always. This is your spoiler alert. We're about to talk about succession [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5498.28s)]
*  We are having we have engineers in this people in the studio literally putting their fingers in their ears [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5502.44s)]
*  So here we go. Now we're going to talk about it. So turn off the podcast. Okay [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5507.88s)]
*  What'd you think? [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5514.04s)]
*  I thought it was fucking great. I loved it. I loved it. I loved it [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5515.639999999999s)]
*  I loved it because I thought it kind of like was very og succession, right? Like the the [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5518.12s)]
*  Election night one and the funeral were like just some of the best television ever seen just these high wires [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5523.96s)]
*  But it kind of went all the way back to the basics in the last one [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5529.32s)]
*  Like we're back with the kids [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5532.68s)]
*  We're back with like the rot of like late stage capitalism and their monstrous father [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5534.44s)]
*  And the fact that they they're all going to lose in the end [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5539.88s)]
*  and if the if this is basically a metaphor for like how america itself has like [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5542.76s)]
*  become a [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5548.68s)]
*  You know like a dying empire [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5549.96s)]
*  The end of this like captured that perfectly right? They'd like this kind of elon musk swede comes in [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5553.64s)]
*  Buys up the thing that is like rotting america so he can profit off of it [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5560.04s)]
*  And these kids are just not even up to the task of holding on to what they think should be theirs [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5563.88s)]
*  With their father created and why he hates them and refuses to let them take over here [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5568.5199999999995s)]
*  Is what I loved about it just from like kind of a tv writing perspective [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5572.04s)]
*  Yeah, sometimes shows that go on for this many seasons have plot points that you think of and are like hey [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5575.5599999999995s)]
*  Remember when that happened like in game of thrones? [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5581.4s)]
*  There were the uh the white walkers that just kind of disappeared after like episode six in the final season [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5584.28s)]
*  It's like that that plot line wasn't relevant anymore, and I was always just like bothered by you know like come on [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5589.5599999999995s)]
*  This was like the driving force in the show the wall for the entire time and now we don't care about that anymore [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5594.2s)]
*  I felt a little bit of that [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5600.44s)]
*  When it came to hey remember when kendall killed the guy [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5602.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like that was a big deal. Yeah, we're never talking about right, but [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5606.04s)]
*  Him lying about telling his brothers or admitting to that to his brothers and sisters [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5610.28s)]
*  Seemingly came back to bite him in the ass in the very end because they were kind of like [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5616.099999999999s)]
*  If you're such a psychopath that you would lie to us about that [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5620.44s)]
*  Then we can't trust you with anything and it just shows that like [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5624.599999999999s)]
*  This is why like kendall is actually like the beating heart of the show as much as like logan [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5628.04s)]
*  Rory was like the fun part to watch because like he's just so broken like nothing matters to the guy [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5631.88s)]
*  So broken and yet even though he gets because the other thing I was like thinking about is that [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5637.08s)]
*  His father used to always tell him like you know have to be willing to be a killer [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5641.8s)]
*  You have to be willing to do anything like and he was [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5644.68s)]
*  Like he was willing finally got there. He got there like at the end [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5648.12s)]
*  He was willing to even lie about the thing that he did that he told his siblings about and having got there [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5650.76s)]
*  He still can't get hold of it. You know [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5657.64s)]
*  It is just like that and to me that's why kendall's like the the the heart of the whole thing [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5661.320000000001s)]
*  I saw jeremy strong who like [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5665.8s)]
*  You know gets shit for being like a bit serious and he sounds like way over the top like super method actor [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5667.96s)]
*  A horrible person to be around at times with the crazy new yorker profile of him where he just sounded like [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5673.64s)]
*  Not fun to hang with I totally dig it though [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5678.76s)]
*  Like I I listened to like some interview with him where he quoted like in the course of the interview like young [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5680.92s)]
*  Shakespeare, you know, like he's just like he's in it [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5686.82s)]
*  He's like deep fucking in it and his point was that he always thought of kendall as this like [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5689.64s)]
*  metaphor for like late stage capitalist america [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5695.24s)]
*  and [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5699.16s)]
*  You've given everything up and sacrificed everything and you somehow have still lost everything, you know [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5700.44s)]
*  Even though he's still like fabulously rich. That's a that's a funny thing. They're also worth like billions [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5705.72s)]
*  Yeah, I mean he's staring in the in the water, but he's like worth like 1.7 billion dollars [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5710.28s)]
*  You know, you could buy that water. I I liked the ending on kendall [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5715.0s)]
*  I like that roman is like gata martini and seems to be smiling at the end like [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5718.200000000001s)]
*  You know what? Actually, maybe it's not the worst thing that i'm out [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5722.68s)]
*  You know, I kind of like that shiv and tom are like chained together in in their miserable existence [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5724.76s)]
*  Um, I I love it cousin greg survives to fight another day [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5731.56s)]
*  I love the greg tom dynamic something that that's the part of the show i'll miss the most [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5735.16s)]
*  I love that because speaking of worldos connor's going to slovenia. We could do a spin-off of just connor as ambassador in slovenia [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5738.84s)]
*  I was talking to max about this max is so impressed by connor's knowledge of random diplomatic posts [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5744.36s)]

*  We'll do car bombing yeah, yeah, let's do car bombing. It's good [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5769.8s)]
*  So I give it a plus. I just i'm gonna miss it and i'm worried that we're never gonna see [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5773.0s)]
*  another show like that the the fact that [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5777.320000000001s)]
*  HBO max like the discovery in their like corporate right-wing overlords decided [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5779.8s)]
*  The max is a better brand [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5784.76s)]
*  When max all I think about is like watching like soft porn when I was like skin of max 19 years old [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5787.080000000001s)]
*  Like they think that you know that just shows you that you're not going to get another succession because all those prestige shows are hbo shows [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5792.120000000001s)]
*  I was listening to uh [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5797.72s)]
*  Kara swisher and scott galloway talking about the max rebrand. It's like [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5799.48s)]
*  Imagine taking the most valuable brand in all of media and just burning it because a new ceo came in and was like [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5803.08s)]
*  Eh, I don't want the last crew to like get any credit. I need to restamp this with my identity [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5810.36s)]
*  It's yeah, but succession will always have that as a document [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5815.24s)]
*  By the way, and I it'll be a fun one to go back and watch in the beginning again [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5818.5199999999995s)]
*  So hannah hadn't watched it for the first two or three seasons. So I rewatched them all with her. I think during [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5821.639999999999s)]
*  Covid and it was a blast to rewatch shiv is better in the arc of it all too. Right because like her character [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5827.160000000001s)]
*  Her character lagged a bit no fault of the great australian actress, uh, sarah snook, but like [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5833.240000000001s)]
*  You know, she had better plot lines early on and and to your point like the things she does towards the end of the series [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5839.64s)]
*  Makes sense if you remember where this kind of started at the beginning and her whole relationship with tom and all the rest of it [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5846.52s)]
*  Yeah, they really tied it together. Well, yeah [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5851.72s)]
*  And there's so many like great fanfic theories like some people think that tom was named after some random [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5853.4s)]
*  Baseball player that played in like the 1920s that did his performed a triple play on his own [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5858.92s)]
*  And the writers had to come out and be like no, no, it's just a funny name frank rich is like [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5863.96s)]
*  What are you talking about? The one thing that is cool is that this is such a british show, right? [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5868.04s)]
*  It's like jesse armstrong this genius showrunner and then you know, uh brian cox the actor [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5871.96s)]
*  Uh, you got in super troopers. Yeah. Yeah the guy plays tom. I think is a brit. Yeah, he's a brit [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5878.04s)]
*  The woman plays shiv is an australian, but it is kind of like telling that this is what smart brits think of america [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5883.24s)]
*  like like uh, we're very critical of uk politics on this show, but like [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5889.4800000000005s)]
*  We got it, you know in our direction, uh, this is what we must look like to the rest of the world [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5894.2s)]
*  There's some really telling lines, uh, like when madson is talking to shiv and he's like you've only been a democracy for like 50 years [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5899.0s)]
*  And she's like, what do you mean 50 years? He's like, well, that's when you guys like gave black people full, right? [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5905.16s)]
*  So, you know, you probably shouldn't discount that you guys have a tendency to do that. It's like such like a [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5909.48s)]
*  Perfectly articulated dagger cutting dagger at us identity. He said like you and botswana, you know, it's about as long as botswana [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5914.36s)]
*  What do you is madson in your mind? Is he like elon musk? Is he like [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5921.5599999999995s)]
*  is he um [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5926.12s)]
*  Like some mixture of like spotify and mark zuckerberg like what do you think he is? It's a good question [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5928.599999999999s)]
*  I I don't know that I was able to pinpoint him. I do think they gave him sort of like a [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5933.96s)]
*  Like a musky musky vibe archetype where [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5937.8s)]
*  You know, he's sort of inscrutable and then is revealed to be just kind of a bozo in some ways and a creep and you know [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5941.719999999999s)]
*  Just sort of like a typical shitty ceo [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5948.28s)]
*  I think what they did well with him is that when you're first introduced him you think oh this guy is really smart [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5950.36s)]
*  He's kind of like a genius and then the more you get to know him you're like actually no [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5954.2s)]
*  He's just as big a boob as the rest of me. He's better and he's european so he sounds better [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5957.16s)]
*  And that's actually like our experience with every tech ceo absolutely [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5961.719999999999s)]
*  You're always like this person's a gene the first time you encounter elon musk or mark zuckerberg [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5964.76s)]
*  You're like what a genius and then like you're like the more you get to know these people like [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5968.92s)]
*  Uh-huh. No, these people are just kind of full of shit and the shine comes out lucky with something and hired the right coders or something [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5972.04s)]
*  Exactly exactly luck and timing. Uh, okay. Well, that's it for our recap. That was fun. That was fun [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5978.12s)]
*  Let's do that again soon. We'll just pick another show and just do a recap. We should just turn this into the rewatchables [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5982.6s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Why not? [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lx0bbxDUhs&t=5989.08s)]
