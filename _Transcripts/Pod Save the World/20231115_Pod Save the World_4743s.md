*  Taken to courting it in meetings interesting. Well, we talked about [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=109.66s)]
*  Yeah, whether Hamas or Israel is doing a better job achieving their political goals [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=113.06s)]
*  We'll talk about the state of free speech in Israel and a lot more very smart very thoughtful guy like a nice step back [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=116.33999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, no, and he was quite active in the opposition to BB's [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=121.42s)]
*  Efforts to dismantle is really democracy. Yeah, he was a real leader and speaking out about that which is important [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=125.82s)]
*  It feels like a million years ago [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=131.46s)]
*  So let's turn to God's been because it's been more than five weeks since Hamas launched the terrorist attack on Israel [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=133.06s)]
*  They killed more than 1200 people the Israeli response which started with airstrikes and now includes this full-ground invasion [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=138.18s)]
*  Of the Gaza Strip is showing no signs of slowing down the Gaza Health Ministry says more than [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=145.02s)]
*  11,200 Palestinians have been killed since October 7th UNICEF says [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=151.02s)]
*  700,000 children in Gaza have been internally displaced and forced to leave their homes often with you know [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=155.58s)]
*  Nothing, but the clothes on their back [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=160.9s)]
*  Hospitals throughout Gaza have been forced to shut down due to lack of fuel to run their generators [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=162.58s)]
*  The reports from these hospitals are just a nightmare [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=167.7s)]
*  The New York Times the Daily did an episode earlier this week that we all listen to and I think all [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=171.42s)]
*  Wept by ourselves in our homes [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=176.34s)]
*  There's you know surgeries without anesthesia babies being removed from incubators that are run out of power [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=178.38s)]
*  Bodies decomposing and in the huge risk of illness [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=184.26s)]
*  The Israeli military is surrounded the Al-Shifa hospital where it says Hamas is built a military command complex below that facility [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=188.14s)]
*  Doctors who work at the hospital deny that there's Hamas infrastructure at that site, but on Tuesday [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=195.86s)]
*  White House spokesman John Kirby said that based on US intelligence [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=201.3s)]
*  The White House has determined that Hamas is in fact operating that of several hospitals in Gaza including Al-Shifa [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=205.16s)]
*  President Biden was asked if he had expressed specific concerns about [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=212.46s)]
*  Israel's targeting of hospitals in his conversations with BB. Then Yahoo. Here's a clip [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=216.62s)]
*  Have you expressed any specific concerns to Israel on that sir? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=220.74s)]
*  well, you know, I have not been reluctant and [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=225.06s)]
*  expressing my concerns going on [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=229.66000000000003s)]
*  and is my hope and expectation that [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=232.34s)]
*  there will be [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=235.62s)]
*  Less [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=239.38000000000002s)]
*  intrusive action relative to the hospital we're in contact and [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=241.38000000000002s)]
*  with with the Israelis also there's an effort to [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=245.78s)]
*  Take this pause to deal with release of prisoners and that's being negotiated as well with the Qataris [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=250.58s)]
*  engaged and [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=259.02000000000004s)]
*  So I made someone hopeful but the hospital must be protected not the strongest language there from Biden then [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=260.5s)]
*  Yeah, there's a you know, there's a couple things going on here. I mean first of all with respect to hospitals, you know, obviously [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=268.86s)]
*  If Hamas is using hospitals to stage equipment or to hide in tunnels underneath [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=275.22s)]
*  That tells you a lot about Hamas [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=281.46000000000004s)]
*  Tells you that they don't value civilian life [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=284.46000000000004s)]
*  On any side at the same time [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=288.14s)]
*  That doesn't mean it's okay to treat hospitals as military targets [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=292.66s)]
*  and we've talked on this podcast about war crimes and [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=296.06s)]
*  You don't say [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=299.54s)]
*  That you know you can't bomb hospitals [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=301.90000000000003s)]
*  But there are exceptions when you can if you don't like something that's happening underneath that hospital around the hospital [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=305.98s)]
*  It's a hospital full stop with Geneva Convention say that you can't attack us you can't so [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=311.58000000000004s)]
*  Again, the donors the doctors and the patients don't become combatants. Yes, Hamas is hiding underneath [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=315.66s)]
*  So if you know, you can't say, you know, I see people saying well see, you know [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=321.14000000000004s)]
*  Hamas is underneath this hospital according to US intelligence [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=324.86s)]
*  So therefore Israel can do whatever they want to do like no, that's not how it works [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=327.66s)]
*  I mean the reason we talked about this before the reason you have laws of war the reason you define certain [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=330.66s)]
*  Targets as off-limits is to protect innocent civilians and there are innocent civilians there. There are children. There are wounded people [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=336.54s)]
*  There are innocent civilians there. This should not be a military target full stop. I mean there you have to find other ways of addressing [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=343.02000000000004s)]
*  The threats, you know [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=350.26000000000005s)]
*  This there's a place for diplomacy in the world and otherwise all you get is the kind of carnage that we're seeing in Gaza [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=352.02000000000004s)]
*  With respect to Biden. I mean, I think part of what you can hear is this kind of growing [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=360.26s)]
*  effort to recalibrate the messaging around [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=364.53999999999996s)]
*  expressing concern about aspects of the Israeli military operation [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=368.17999999999995s)]
*  Trying to urge some restraint [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=372.21999999999997s)]
*  from the Israeli government and [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=374.5s)]
*  Emphasizing the need to negotiate the release of hostages because that's a much better way of getting them out [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=376.97999999999996s)]
*  The one thing I will say here, you know, I wish President Biden [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=382.7s)]
*  Could do a couple of additional things here [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=387.61999999999995s)]
*  The first is he's shown tremendous empathy [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=389.94s)]
*  When he talks about the Israeli loss of life on October 7th, and we've talked about how he did that with Israeli families, too [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=393.85999999999996s)]
*  When he went to Israel [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=400.02s)]
*  He just doesn't talk the same way [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=402.58s)]
*  When when he's addressing the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=405.17999999999995s)]
*  And so I really wish that he could speak more to what is upsetting people [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=409.78s)]
*  Obviously principally in Gaza, but also around the world which is just seeing children [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=414.14s)]
*  Suffering like this and seeing innocent people suffering like this and the other thing is, you know that there is a [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=418.14s)]
*  But then what to when he says things like I expect Israel to do this [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=424.34s)]
*  I'm telling Israel to do this and and day by day you don't see Israel [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=429.26s)]
*  The and we should be very clear. We don't see BB Netanyahu the Israeli Prime Minister [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=433.62s)]
*  Basically [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=437.82s)]
*  Taking any of this on board and so it kind of begins to beg the question the rest of world is looking at this [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=439.06s)]
*  It's like what's the point of this recalibration if it doesn't? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=444.5s)]
*  Lead to any changes in either Israeli policy or frankly in terms of US support because it's basically like well [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=447.98s)]
*  I've asked not to do this, but I'm also really gonna try to get this 15 billion dollars for them out of Congress and I [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=453.62s)]
*  Unwaveringly support their right to defend themselves. I mean at a certain point [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=459.21999999999997s)]
*  What what happens if you're not getting through to the Israeli leadership that is undertaking this yeah [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=462.5s)]
*  I got a frustrated text from a friend over the weekend [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=469.21999999999997s)]
*  You saw something I tweeted criticizing Netanyahu and his point was basically, you know, what happened on October 7th [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=471.26s)]
*  Israel can't go on with you know, a well-armed fully constituted Hamas in perpetuity [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=478.62s)]
*  They're gonna have to take out their leadership and take out the military infrastructure. What do you think he should do differently? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=484.94s)]
*  What should the IDF do differently? I said look, I'm not a military expert [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=490.3s)]
*  I have no intelligence but one thing I would do differently is you just you can't attack [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=493.12s)]
*  hospitals like these are full of patients, they're also full of [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=499.62s)]
*  Civilians just camped out in these courtyards are trying to find any place safe to avoid airstrikes and the IDF just can't target these places [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=504.38s)]
*  Like I and they also can't say well you should all evacuate [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=511.3s)]
*  I think then yeah [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=515.06s)]
*  I was saying we offer to evacuate everyone because the the health officials are saying look we have [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=515.8199999999999s)]
*  700 people at one hospital that are too sick to be moved [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=519.7800000000001s)]
*  They'll all die [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=523.22s)]
*  but you if you maybe if you want to somehow facilitate the transfer of people to another location if you take them there somehow or [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=524.0600000000001s)]
*  If you find them alternate medical infrastructure that can actually care for them [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=531.46s)]
*  Maybe that's a conversation you can have but that's a longer term thing and in the meantime, you just have to show restraint because [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=535.74s)]
*  Because you have to because it's a law of war. Well, because where is it gonna lead? What's it gonna accomplish? You know [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=543.38s)]
*  The [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=548.9399999999999s)]
*  There's the different dimensions to this include the fact that first of all, you know the the US [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=550.42s)]
*  Clearly in the course of 20 years after 9-eleven. We talked about the overreach of 9-eleven, you know [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=556.06s)]
*  There were all manner of things that the US did that should be criticized [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=561.9799999999999s)]
*  It should be scrutinized some of which happened in the Obama years, but it just wasn't the case [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=565.9399999999999s)]
*  You know that I mean the bin Laden operation comes to my mind, you know, one of the reasons why [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=571.4s)]
*  President Obama ordered a [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=576.06s)]
*  Special forces raid deep into Pakistan to get Osama bin Laden [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=578.62s)]
*  You know part of it was he wanted to make sure that there was bin Laden [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=582.74s)]
*  but another consideration was he was living in a compound with his very large family and a [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=585.8199999999999s)]
*  Drone strike on that compound would have killed, you know bin Laden's family [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=591.74s)]
*  Hospital, you know, there was an al-qaeda leader plotting an attack against New York under a hospital [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=598.78s)]
*  I actually don't believe the US would have like [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=603.14s)]
*  And certainly there have been horrific mistakes made by the US government military people can have weddings [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=605.86s)]
*  You're right. You're correct. You're correct. We're talking about a deliberate targeting of a hospital [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=611.06s)]
*  And by the way, we're saying is yeah, it's wrong when the US does it [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=615.34s)]
*  It's wrong when Israel does this wrong when anybody does it and and this is why you have laws of war and in terms of the [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=617.9s)]
*  alternatives if the if part of what you're trying to do is get the hostages released [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=622.86s)]
*  I just continue to believe that bombing is a less effective way of getting hostages released than negotiating [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=626.48s)]
*  deals which Joe Biden clearly believes too because he keeps pivoting to this process with Qatar and they also think like a more targeted effort against [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=632.1s)]
*  Hamas it is accompanied by political strategy to have a different Palestinian leadership and actually make peace is a much more sustainable way of [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=638.54s)]
*  Trying to secure Israel then [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=645.54s)]
*  essentially destroying all of Gaza [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=648.22s)]
*  Displacing all these people and maybe killing a lot of Hamas terrorists [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=651.14s)]
*  But in the process, you know hardening attitudes and radicalizing new generations of Palestinians [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=655.14s)]
*  You know that I don't think this does work [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=660.32s)]
*  No, I don't either so the US is obviously fully backed Israel in this conflict so far [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=663.3000000000001s)]
*  Much of the international community has been in a different place than us or quickly moving to a different place [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=668.1600000000001s)]
*  Here's a clip from a recent interview with French President Emmanuel Macron. We clearly [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=673.72s)]
*  Condemned the terrorist attack and stories group and recognize the right of Israel to protect itself and react [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=678.48s)]
*  but day one [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=685.2800000000001s)]
*  We say that this reaction and the fight against terrorism [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=687.0s)]
*  Because it is led by a democracy should be compliant with international rules [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=691.76s)]
*  all of war and and humanitarian international law and [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=696.36s)]
*  Day after day what we saw is a permanent bombing of civilians in Gaza and I think it's [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=703.28s)]
*  It's very important to say the whole story [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=711.0s)]
*  but I [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=714.6s)]
*  Think this is the only solution we have [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=717.6s)]
*  this is fire [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=721.0s)]
*  Because it's impossible to explain we want to fight against terrorism [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=723.12s)]
*  By coming innocent people [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=728.64s)]
*  I think that's worth pointing out that while the Macron is calling for a ceasefire [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=730.68s)]
*  The war is actually escalating for the United States because on Sunday the US conducted more airstrikes in Syria on facilities [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=733.96s)]
*  linked to Iran and Iranian proxy forces [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=740.36s)]
*  This is the third set of military strikes by the US directly since October 26 in response to these dozens of attacks [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=742.4s)]
*  Against US forces in Syria and Iraq at least 56 US service members have been injured in these attacks in recent weeks [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=749.84s)]
*  Which you know that to me is a huge deal and I feel like it's barely getting covered [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=756.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean the Macron pieces is really interesting because out of the gate, you know, I think the French the Germans the British [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=761.5600000000001s)]
*  Generally took the same position as the US [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=769.32s)]
*  In supporting Israel. Yeah, and and what this demonstrates is the beginning of that cracking [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=771.6400000000001s)]
*  I think in response to international public opinion [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=777.48s)]
*  I think in response to you hear my chrome like genuine questions about whether this approach is the right one is morally right and [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=779.96s)]
*  Strategically, right and and I think that's gonna continue to be the case and it does point out that the US is is pretty isolated [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=786.48s)]
*  You know in the position it's taken at this point [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=793.7600000000001s)]
*  and and look the regional piece of this is [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=797.44s)]
*  You know, this is more than a low boil [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=800.64s)]
*  I mean, this is you know back and forth with Iranian proxies and I think that the thing that is probably concerning [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=803.8s)]
*  the people in the White House and as well as people like Presma Crone is that [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=810.12s)]
*  There's an open-ended nature to this Israeli military operation where it could last, you know [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=814.08s)]
*  There's a scenario where it just lasts I know two or three weeks more and somehow there's a ceasefire [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=818.16s)]
*  But I think it seems like the more likely scenarios a kind of open-ended military operation in Gaza [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=823.64s)]
*  Yeah, and the longer this goes if this is going for months and months and months [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=827.88s)]
*  the more those kinds of exchanges of fire the Iranian proxies the more [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=831.72s)]
*  Israel's exchanging fire with Hezbollah on the northern border. We've seen people killed on both sides of that border [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=836.52s)]
*  I mean this is it's not escalating to the worst-case scenario [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=841.12s)]
*  But it's you know, it's still very much a present threat and the longer this goes on [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=844.32s)]
*  The more you're just kind of betting that something doesn't really ignite one of those theaters [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=850.2s)]
*  You know to be much more on fire and would be be gets pressed on time [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=856.7s)]
*  He's like well, I think it'll take less time than the US effort against ISIS which took a long time took years [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=860.4200000000001s)]
*  The other big disconnect that's emerging between the US and Israel is about long-term governance in Gaza [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=865.26s)]
*  This is a clip of Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu on meet the press this past weekend as far as a civilian management of Gaza [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=870.58s)]
*  We need to see the following two things Gaza has to be demilitarized and Gaza has to be [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=877.82s)]
*  De-radicalized and I think so far we haven't seen any [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=884.54s)]
*  Palestinian force including the Palestinian Authority that is able to do it. They teach their children to hate Israel [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=888.9s)]
*  They're not fighting terrorists. They're paying for slay. That is the more terrorists [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=896.02s)]
*  Palestinian terrorists murder Jews the more they get paid and to this date 36 days after the worst savage [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=900.66s)]
*  We perpetrated on the Jewish people since the Holocaust the Palestinian Authority president has yet [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=906.86s)]
*  Refuses to condemn the savagery. So, you know, we need a different authority. We need a different administration [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=912.62s)]
*  Who would that be? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=920.26s)]
*  Minister who would that be? I think it's too early to say [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=922.78s)]
*  Kirsten, I think it's too early to say but I could say one thing the first task we have to achieve is defeat Hamas [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=926.0600000000001s)]
*  So then yeah, whose line there is very different from what Secretary of State Tony Blinken was saying last week [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=931.9s)]
*  Tony stressed that [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=937.58s)]
*  Palestinians can't be forcibly displaced from Gaza. He said that Israel can't reoccupy Gaza or put a blockade back on Gaza [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=939.22s)]
*  He also said quote we must also work on the affirmative elements to get to a sustained peace [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=945.6600000000001s)]
*  This must include the Palestinian people's voices and aspirations at the center of a post-crisis governance in Gaza [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=950.5400000000001s)]
*  It must include Palestinian-led governance in Gaza unified with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority and it must include a sustained mechanism for [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=955.8000000000001s)]
*  Reconstruction in Gaza any pathway to Israelis and Palestinians living side-by-side in space of their own with equal measures of security freedom opportunity [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=963.86s)]
*  indignity end quote [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=972.0600000000001s)]
*  Then I I don't see any way to square the circle between what Tony was saying and what Netanyahu was saying [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=973.46s)]
*  No, I think this is the main chasm now that's emerged between the US and Israel and that Biden himself said early in this process [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=978.7s)]
*  He did want to see a reoccupation of Gaza [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=985.1s)]
*  Tony is really emphasized his point about the Palestinian Authority taking over governance of Gaza [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=987.46s)]
*  When the fighting stops that was kind of reaffirmed by the g7 too [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=992.02s)]
*  So that's kind of the default position of the world's most advanced [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=995.58s)]
*  and richest democracies [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=999.94s)]
*  And and what Netanyahu is saying is is no that we don't agree with that [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1001.5s)]
*  Number one, he's indicated that Israel should have some kind of indefinite security responsibility over Gaza [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1005.66s)]
*  And now he's also indicated that there's really not any Palestinian leadership that he would trust [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1012.02s)]
*  to govern Gaza [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1017.58s)]
*  So that that's just you know [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1019.66s)]
*  Never mind the fact actually that this Israeli government is not even recognized that a two-state solution is an objective [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1021.78s)]
*  So there's a huge gap at you know, kind of on the back end of where we're headed [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1027.86s)]
*  That I'm not sure how you you know, how do you address that unless the US is willing to say, you know [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1032.7s)]
*  We're gonna condition some of the things we're doing for you on whether or not you accept Palestinian Authority [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1039.24s)]
*  Governance of Gaza whether or not you allow for the reconstruction of Gaza or whether or not you allow for the pursuit of a Palestinian state [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1044.94s)]
*  That's ultimately gonna be a question that has to be answered in terms of what happens in Gaza, you know [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1051.9s)]
*  First of all, and now I make this point about demilitarizing and then deradicalizing [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1059.26s)]
*  What they are doing is I think likely to have the opposite effect of deradicalization [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1064.6200000000001s)]
*  There's gonna be the people that are dead [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1069.78s)]
*  but then the [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1072.34s)]
*  extraordinary number of people that are internally displaced like almost everybody in your Zikandar in Gaza and how many buildings are gonna be destroyed you're gonna have [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1073.54s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of people that are homeless in Gaza and stuck there because they [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1080.06s)]
*  Can't get into Egypt and nor do they want to get into Egypt [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1084.54s)]
*  And so this is gonna be a massive endeavor to provide for these people [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1087.46s)]
*  And look, there's different ways you could do this [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1091.7s)]
*  The preferred US ways to build out the Palestinian Authority in both places and have that be the future government Palestinian state [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1093.7s)]
*  BB said a lot of you know BB pointed out that there are elements of the Palestinian Authority [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1100.94s)]
*  Things that they that are taught in Palestinian schools are absolutely reprehensible [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1105.6200000000001s)]
*  It's also the case that the Palestinian Authority is a leadership that recognizes Israel's right to exist [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1109.66s)]
*  That is not an Islamist organization like Hamas that has cooperated with Israel including on security for a long time [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1114.7s)]
*  To the point that they're kind of seen as a subcontractor for Israel in the West Bank [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1121.24s)]
*  And so I think he's painting the worst light an organization that the Israeli government itself and the IDF has worked with a lot [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1125.84s)]
*  The other alternative is to have a kind of multinational Arab peacekeeping force in Gaza [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1133.52s)]
*  And this is something that you know is getting more traction and talk now [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1137.6s)]
*  Which Arab government might be willing to do that is a question [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1141.52s)]
*  But I mean that's an alternative is that there's some interim period where you have an Arab peacekeeping force [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1144.8s)]
*  Providing security in Gaza. I don't know if Israel would accept that either but this question is [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1150.04s)]
*  The one that has been the most unanswered and and BB is repeatedly seemed to suggest a very long-term and kind of open-ended [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1154.8400000000001s)]
*  Israeli control over Gaza which runs counter to all this effort from the US to put an emphasis on what comes next [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1161.64s)]
*  Yeah in complicating all of this are the estimated 240 hostages still being held throughout the Gaza Strip [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1166.92s)]
*  Mostly by the Hamas, but I've seen reports that at least dozens of them are being held by other militant groups [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1173.8400000000001s)]
*  Like Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which obviously complicates any negotiations over their release if you have to go to multiple parties [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1179.68s)]
*  The hostages include the elderly children [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1186.24s)]
*  There is a three-year-old American toddler whose parents were killed by Hamas being held right now [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1190.3600000000001s)]
*  There have been lots of reports recently about potential hostage deals [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1196.16s)]
*  Over the weekend the New York Times reported that there was nearly a deal to release 50 hostages in exchange for a ceasefire [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1200.2s)]
*  But those negotiations broke down over communications challenges and then the Israeli ground invasion [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1206.4s)]
*  On Tuesdays CNN reported that Israel and Hamas are close to a hostage release deal in exchange for what? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1212.4s)]
*  CNN described as a sustained days-long pause in fighting a Hamas spokesman said that the talks were focused on the release of 70 women [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1218.76s)]
*  And children in exchange for a five-day pause these talks are being [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1226.28s)]
*  Negotiated by Qatar the CIA the Mossad which is Israel's version of the CIA [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1231.0s)]
*  President Biden was asked about a potential hostage deal at a White House event on Tuesday [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1235.9199999999998s)]
*  He said quote I've been talking to people involved every single day [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1239.74s)]
*  I believe it's gonna happen, but I don't want to get into details and Biden later said his message to the families was hang [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1243.0s)]
*  In there we are coming [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1249.04s)]
*  Earlier this week. We spoke with Efrat Machikawa [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1250.76s)]
*  Five members of her family are being held hostage in Gaza right now her aunt her uncle her uncle's son Doran and Doran's two [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1254.6799999999998s)]
*  daughters aged three and five [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1262.2s)]
*  Here's Efrat talking about what this past five weeks has been like for her and her family and her experience at a rally this past [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1264.68s)]
*  weekend for the hostages this [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1271.3600000000001s)]
*  Over a month time feels like a one long long long [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1273.92s)]
*  tiring day it is just [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1280.04s)]
*  Incredible to think that so many people are [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1283.04s)]
*  Down there probably in tunnels [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1286.92s)]
*  We don't know what are they eating if they're eating are they well are they still alive? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1289.08s)]
*  What about the little babies that were taken? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1294.6s)]
*  What about the elderly like my uncle and my aunt and have absolutely no clue [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1297.32s)]
*  Where are they are there alive are they being fed do they have the medicine? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1305.0s)]
*  it's [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1311.8s)]
*  It's [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1312.8799999999999s)]
*  So painful that you when you try to breathe and talk at the same time you feel you have not enough [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1314.04s)]
*  Oxygen in your lungs to actually express how worried we are how much evil we are [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1322.1599999999999s)]
*  Surrounded with I think people outside cannot understand that the size of this catastrophe [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1330.28s)]
*  Is national in Israel there isn't anyone in Israel that I know [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1336.6799999999998s)]
*  Who does not know someone that was either in the peace party or in those? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1342.28s)]
*  kibbutzim in those places [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1349.32s)]
*  We all know somebody so we're there to support each other, but we're also there to shout out [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1352.08s)]
*  Nothing can go back to normal not in Israel and not in the world in our view unless [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1360.28s)]
*  everybody [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1368.0s)]
*  Everybody comes back home. It's just an important reminder that in five weeks since the Samas attack, but for these hostages for their families [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1369.44s)]
*  Every day is just as excruciating as that they was and you know [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1378.08s)]
*  Also a reminder that many of the people who were attacked that day and killed or taken were living on these kibbutz's [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1381.44s)]
*  Because they were some of the most people committed to peace in the entire country. Yeah, it's such a I mean any any loss of life and [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1388.46s)]
*  hostage shaking is absolutely tragic the fact that [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1396.34s)]
*  Generally those were the communities that were targeted is just an additional tragedy. I mean again [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1400.3s)]
*  I think this issue of the hostages [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1407.2s)]
*  To me underscores, you know, cuz some people might get frustrated [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1410.18s)]
*  Listening to us urging this kind of restraint in terms of the Israeli military operation think what about these hostages and we can't emphasize enough [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1415.06s)]
*  like I I truly believe that that you are going to be much more effective in getting more hostages out faster through [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1421.46s)]
*  This kind of negotiating channel. I mean a five-day pause in order to release 70 hostages who wouldn't take that deal [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1429.3s)]
*  You know, we've been on the table since last month and and I you know and look it bear there there [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1436.6200000000001s)]
*  To return to the 9-eleven analogy it it just you know, Israel is understandably traumatized [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1443.42s)]
*  but the Israeli leadership [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1449.5s)]
*  these very big questions like the one we were just talking about the endgame of this military operation like [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1451.74s)]
*  It's so unclear that a pause I think is in their interest to to consider [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1456.18s)]
*  Consider what they're doing. Yeah, and how far they want to go with this because the way it's going now [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1460.6200000000001s)]
*  I think ends very poorly for everybody [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1465.8s)]
*  It's you know, whether it's hostages whether it's Israel its own security and obviously first and foremost for Palestinian civilians who are dying by the thousands [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1468.08s)]
*  you know, I've heard the White House and is in echo the line that like Hamas would benefit from a ceasefire like [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1476.04s)]
*  We should emphasize again like actually that's that's not true Palestinian civilians would benefit a lot from a ceasefire [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1482.68s)]
*  You know, and it's not like Gaza is not being heavily monitored right now and and there's gonna be some massive Hamas break out here [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1488.36s)]
*  So I just hope that there's a more diplomatic push [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1494.76s)]
*  That'd be a great thing if they can achieve that agreement to get 70 people out [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1498.28s)]
*  It would be an enormous enormous lift for I think everyone in Israel [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1502.04s)]
*  Ben I did see that the Israeli spyware company the NSO group is using the hostage situation to do PR for themselves [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1506.32s)]
*  Someone connected with the NSO group leaked to Axios that the Pegasus spyware software that has been used to track journalists and dissidents and activists [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1514.08s)]
*  Is now also being used to track Hamas members and potentially hostages so [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1522.04s)]
*  Great job flacking that one. I guess pretty pretty dystopian time for PR and the reality is it's not like there aren't other ways to [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1527.32s)]
*  So like maybe wait wait a little while for the advertisement fucking gross [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1537.8s)]
*  Finally, we talked we should add the NSO groups been blacklisted by the United States government [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1543.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, part of the reason they're doing this is to lobby Congress to an American outlet [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1547.6s)]
*  Very deeply cynical. Yeah, finally, we talked with Fida al-arej. She works in Gaza for the nonprofit organization Oxfam [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1550.92s)]
*  She's sheltering with her family family of eight at her friend's two-bedroom home in southern Gaza [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1559.3200000000002s)]
*  Her friend is a family of five. So it's two bedroom house one bathroom all these people [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1565.44s)]
*  We asked her to describe just a day in her life since the October 7th attacks. We started very early the journey of [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1569.92s)]
*  Securing everyday life things water drinking water bread [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1578.28s)]
*  food for the day and [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1584.6399999999999s)]
*  It takes so many hours. I [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1586.8s)]
*  Can I still can't believe how? [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1590.32s)]
*  Easy our life used to be like you used to open the tab and have water or [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1594.28s)]
*  Go to the bakery and get some bread and that's it [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1601.08s)]
*  Nowadays we wake up we start thinking [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1605.52s)]
*  Who's gonna go to fetch water then? What's the transport that you're gonna use? Of course forget about cars [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1609.2s)]
*  We do have a car but it's useless now with lack of a fuel. So either you secure [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1617.04s)]
*  Don't keep old cart or something like this or you just decide to walk all throughout the day [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1624.6000000000001s)]
*  We try to reach our [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1631.04s)]
*  Families and our friends through phones [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1633.64s)]
*  It's very very very very difficult to get through to someone over the phone [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1635.88s)]
*  So you keep trying regardless of the hour day and night anytime every all the time [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1642.76s)]
*  Just to try to catch someone for me personally some nights [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1648.72s)]
*  Were very unbearable, you know, all of the scenarios keep playing in my mind [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1654.2s)]
*  Am I gonna lose one of my kids? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1659.04s)]
*  Are they gonna lose me is this next strike gonna hit us? [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1662.08s)]
*  all of this all night through and then you [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1667.36s)]
*  Wait for the break of dawn. I don't know what what's the difference because we are killed day and night [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1672.56s)]
*  But I don't know just maybe to make sure that the word is still exists in the daylight [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1678.2s)]
*  And repeat all over again [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1685.8s)]
*  and again [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1688.8s)]
*  You know two examples there of the just unbearable suffering from innocent people both Israeli and Palestinian because of this war [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1689.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and I don't know how you can listen to that [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1697.8s)]
*  Both of those clips and and not essentially if you believe that that the lives of those two people [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1701.52s)]
*  Are not disposable that they matter and that they matter equally [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1711.12s)]
*  I [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1715.52s)]
*  Don't know how you couldn't think that like a ceasefire in some effort to actually achieve a peace here [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1716.6s)]
*  Isn't better for those people. I mean, this is a mom. This is not some Hamas member [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1722.44s)]
*  You know and and a worker. Yeah, and and what she's pointing to is again the reality that there is no fuel left in Gaza [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1726.6s)]
*  Water is hard to come by Bay Grease have been bombed [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1733.96s)]
*  Well documented and life was hard in Gaza before this [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1737.12s)]
*  What's chilling to hear say like oh we used to have it so good [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1740.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean so good that we're living in Gaza, you know, like I mean it just again [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1742.9s)]
*  it just underscores that if we can just see the humanity and everybody like the the solutions become a bit more obvious and then [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1748.3s)]
*  then the rationalizations that people make for [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1757.18s)]
*  for either Hamas is horrific attack or for this kind of [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1760.5s)]
*  Pretty indiscriminate response and it's not an equivalency like don't know [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1765.18s)]
*  Obviously Hamas like proceeded with absolutely zero regard for human life period [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1770.02s)]
*  but you know proceeding with relatively little regard for the [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1775.46s)]
*  Circumstances of two million people in Gaza that doesn't make that that the right solution to dealing with Hamas [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1780.3s)]
*  Yeah, no, I mean what Hamas did Hamas launched this terrorist attack [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1785.86s)]
*  With the goal of killing as many civilians as possible with the in the hopes of getting an overwhelming [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1790.34s)]
*  Israeli military response so that would become this global story and it would reignite [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1796.54s)]
*  People behind the Palestinian cause right now. They're getting what they want [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1801.78s)]
*  Yes [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1805.1399999999999s)]
*  You know and and I talked about with this you've all and as much as I understand [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1805.46s)]
*  The need to take out Hamas's military capability as much as I understand the desire for revenge [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1809.34s)]
*  You just have to listen to the voices of the people caught in the middle who are suffering and realize that what's happening right now [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1814.84s)]
*  It's fucking madness and it's it's it's in no one [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1820.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and I'd say this is an American because this is how I felt after 9-eleven [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1823.42s)]
*  We had our overreach with torture and Gitmo and the Iraq war like what is this doing to us, you know? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1826.54s)]
*  What if Israel destroys Gaza? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1832.6200000000001s)]
*  What what does that do to the nature of of Israeli society in the same way that the 9-eleven? [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1834.8200000000002s)]
*  I think did some bad things to the [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1840.3400000000001s)]
*  nature of American society and politics and and I'm really glad you know, you made this point precisely because some ass doesn't value human life [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1842.5s)]
*  Precisely because Hamas in addition to wanting to eradicate Jewish Israeli life doesn't value Palestinian life [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1850.78s)]
*  They to your point they won an overreaction like that's what they didn't like [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1857.54s)]
*  I think that's been landed. They didn't like the Abraham Accords. They didn't like that. The Palestinians were cut out of things [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1862.1799999999998s)]
*  They didn't like they weren't the center of attention [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1866.36s)]
*  They didn't do this thinking that there would be no Israeli reaction [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1868.3s)]
*  They did this because they thought there might be an Israeli overreaction [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1871.82s)]
*  Which would put them in an even stronger position and so we have to understand that if you're fighting arsonists [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1874.82s)]
*  You don't fight arsonists with more fire. You fight them with water, you know, like it's so so [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1880.3s)]
*  That's just such an important point that is missed here [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1886.14s)]
*  If you're doing what what you're being kind of baited into doing [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1888.94s)]
*  That's not that's likely not the right reaction though. We're gonna take a quick break. We come back [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=1894.1000000000001s)]

*  Of his cabinet that has left a lot of people like scratching their heads [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2081.3399999999997s)]
*  I think is the best way to maybe phrase it. Here's the the headline for what happened [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2084.8399999999997s)]
*  Home secretary, Suela Braverman is out. She was sacked as they say [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2090.02s)]
*  She will be replaced by James Cleverly who had been serving as the Foreign Secretary and then former [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2094.2599999999998s)]
*  British Prime Minister David Cameron is back into government as the Foreign Secretary [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2099.62s)]
*  Yes that David Cameron the man responsible for brexit if you haven't heard of Suela Braverman [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2104.38s)]
*  Yeah, consider yourself lucky. She represents the far right of the Tory party [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2111.22s)]
*  She was behind some of the worst anti-immigrant policies and rhetoric. She called the pro-palestinian [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2115.0s)]
*  Protests hate marches. She said that homelessness was a lifestyle choice [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2120.74s)]
*  terrible person [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2125.74s)]
*  By the end of her time as Home Secretary it seemed clear that she wanted to get fired [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2127.38s)]
*  Yeah [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2131.44s)]
*  She wanted to be martyred on some right-wing cause so she can run again in a future Tory party later leadership election [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2131.9s)]
*  So she's gone, but she's not forgotten sadly [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2137.62s)]
*  David Cameron you might recall served as the Prime Minister from 2010 to 2016 [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2140.2200000000003s)]
*  Then he brilliantly put forward the brexit referendum lost the vote [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2144.82s)]
*  resigned from Parliament and has watched the smoldering wreckage of [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2150.5s)]
*  Brexit from the sidelines ever since where he's been making tons of money as sort of a pseudo creepy lobbyist [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2154.82s)]
*  Because Cameron is no longer a member of Parliament [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2160.7799999999997s)]
*  He had to be named to the House of Lords to become eligible to serve as Foreign Secretary [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2163.14s)]
*  So this whole thing must be just an enormous insult to every other member of the Tory party [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2168.98s)]
*  Who got passed over for the job by a guy who wasn't even eligible and then frankly like a Foreign Secretary from the House of Lords [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2173.86s)]
*  A real like Victorian England now gets me a Lord Lord David Lord David. Yeah, let me cake vibes [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2180.7s)]
*  So Ben, I was trying to think of an equivalent in US politics [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2185.62s)]
*  Since Brexit is, you know arguably the biggest foreign policy disaster in in modern British history [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2188.74s)]
*  Do you think this would be fair to compare it to like a future Republican naming George W [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2194.2599999999998s)]
*  Bush Secretary of State if a rock is our yeah, that's that's a pretty good one [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2199.54s)]
*  I do watch the crown coming, you know, I gotta so I love it [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2204.5s)]
*  The crown I think [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2208.18s)]
*  Peter Jackson the guy made the crown his next series should be like a seven part Netflix series [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2209.7s)]
*  It starts with brexit and goes through all these Tory governments, you know [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2214.5s)]
*  You could have like the Liz Trust season and you know now we're up to like season seven really short seasons [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2217.82s)]
*  The few things about this you you're right about so swell Braverman is a uniquely odious political figure [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2224.82s)]
*  I mean she's talked about you know [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2229.98s)]
*  Targeting boats of refugees coming across the channel. She wants to scrap the entire UN Convention on refugees [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2232.54s)]
*  She's you know [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2237.7s)]
*  She actively tried to get fired by calling all these, you know peaceful demonstrations [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2240.06s)]
*  around the Palestinians hate marches and attacked the police for [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2245.46s)]
*  The cops won easy on the Black Lives Matter protesters, which has not been most people's experience with the police [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2251.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't think yeah, it was kind of any you're right though [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2256.24s)]
*  It was just kind of like a big fire me sign that she was holding up [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2258.9399999999996s)]
*  So that after Ritchie Sunak loses if he loses she can make a play [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2261.5s)]
*  To kind of run for Tory party leader as like the most far-right hardline [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2265.14s)]
*  Remember the Tories the way they choose their leaders is about a hundred fifty thousand actual dues paying members of the Tory party choose [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2270.46s)]
*  So you can just appeal to the rightist right-wing sliver of the country [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2277.06s)]
*  Yeah [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2280.58s)]
*  and so I can see why Ritchie Sunak is like I gotta get rid of this person and and and and and [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2280.8s)]
*  You know truth he's I think trying to tack to the center like definitely what's funny is a cure starman Ritchie Sunak are like [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2285.34s)]
*  Really elbowing each other out for the center because cure starmer is getting all this shit for like [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2290.94s)]
*  Pivoting to the center and a whole bunch of stuff including not calling for a ceasefire in Gaza [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2296.38s)]
*  And Ritchie Sunak is like well David Cameron is seen as a centrist [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2300.18s)]
*  And we should know by the way like just like Chris Christie was on Potsy of America [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2304.7000000000003s)]
*  We did have David Cameron on the world. He was our he's our center, right a guest [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2308.2200000000003s)]
*  way back in the day, but the reality of this is I [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2312.7000000000003s)]
*  just gotta say like [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2315.98s)]
*  David Cameron becoming foreign secretary does kind of prove the theory that like if you went to Eden or like a white guy like you can [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2318.1s)]
*  Like call a brexit referendum and lose it and and so can we be foreign secretary like? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2325.98s)]
*  There's nothing that you can do that could get you voted off the island and you get to be a lord [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2331.42s)]
*  You know taboo and everything. I don't quite get you so I maybe we she's seen that things like that [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2334.94s)]
*  This is a signal that he's like a more moderate guy [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2340.94s)]
*  But the whole thing is just kind of weird to me because like is you know [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2343.36s)]
*  There's gonna be an election within a year is David Cameron in this for like the long haul or is he just like the stopgap? [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2347.24s)]
*  Foreign secretary for a few months. I don't this poor James Cleverly guy like, you know, just now [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2352.16s)]
*  Yeah, I guess he's home secretary [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2357.08s)]
*  But I just don't get what David Cameron brings into it other than reminding people of [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2358.36s)]
*  I mean, there's a nice book into it. It kind of reminds people of the chaos [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2365.0s)]
*  It kind of reminds people of the chaos that started this whole era of Tory rule was which is Cameron deciding now the referendum the first place [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2368.16s)]
*  Maybe that's like a good way for it to end [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2374.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think Cameron brings you like kind of a surprising. Yeah [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2377.2s)]
*  Yeah, it gets you away from all the talk of Swellabrever man [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2383.3199999999997s)]
*  Who's terrible the crazy thing about the British system is James Cleverly like sort of a boring whatever? [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2385.84s)]
*  fine guy [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2392.24s)]
*  Nothing about that guy you just get plucked out of your job and you get dropped in as home secretary [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2394.1200000000003s)]
*  Which is basically the equivalent of going from Secretary of State to Secretary of Homeland Security [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2398.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, there's no time for training [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2402.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2403.6400000000003s)]
*  You have to be available for like the questions in front of Parliament [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2404.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, three days from now like the system is madness like none of these people are prepared for the job [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2407.2400000000002s)]
*  That's a really good point. The toys keep doing these cabinet reshuffles as if like, you know, these jobs are totally interchangeable [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2410.92s)]
*  Yeah, you're like well who's actually minding the store I've been reading Rory Stewart's book after he came on the pod [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2417.7200000000003s)]
*  It's very good a couple thoughts one [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2422.48s)]
*  He talks about this a lot about how like you literally show up at the job and you spend weeks like [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2424.88s)]
*  Learning where the bathrooms are like you have no idea what you're doing. You have no training for these jobs to [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2429.88s)]
*  He Rory and Cameron did not get along. They didn't like each other [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2434.92s)]
*  I think Cameron really didn't want Rory to be a member of Parliament or run in the first place [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2438.44s)]
*  But it's interesting the way you listen we're dumb Americans [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2444.4s)]
*  Okay, we see a guy with like floppy kind of Hugh Grant hair and we hear a British accent [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2447.88s)]
*  We think you must be a goddamn genius [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2452.96s)]
*  but David Cameron is just a guy who like [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2454.28s)]
*  grounded out as a special advisor to powerful people in a ministry and you know [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2457.4s)]
*  Ran a bunch of local elections and worked his way up as an MP for I think 15 years before he finally got a shot [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2461.8s)]
*  I don't know. These folks are a little more parochial than [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2467.76s)]
*  We might think just to note that we're equal opportunity here [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2472.28s)]
*  Like Tony Blair responsible for the Iraq war and all these things [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2475.38s)]
*  He's still hanging around to like there's nine lines for these guys and you're right about this like the Hugh Grant of it [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2478.7400000000002s)]
*  All like I think there's a funny thing about British prime ministers [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2483.86s)]
*  We're like, you know [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2487.1400000000003s)]
*  if you kind of look a certain way like a certain kind of white English guy like, you know, like decent hair and like [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2487.94s)]
*  You know like a big grin like, you know, then that's like half the way to being prime minister [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2493.58s)]
*  You know and then Americans looking from abroad and everybody sounds a little more articulate, you know [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2498.34s)]
*  Like Boris Johnson sounds like maybe he's like knows he's talking about just because he has a British accent, you know [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2502.34s)]
*  Like there's some of that. There's a lot of that our friends over at Pod save the UK [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2507.38s)]
*  Did a fantastic mini episode on all of this? [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2511.98s)]
*  They also did a great one before that on the King's speech where they just went through the process how it gets written [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2514.6400000000003s)]
*  Everything could you imagine your speechwriter for Barack Obama and then once a year or whatever you have to write a [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2520.6600000000003s)]
*  Speech for the King. Yeah, the Queen of England. I'm a bizarre process the government prepares the speech [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2526.6200000000003s)]
*  For the monarch and then they read it. Yeah that that that's always the strangest one because like the the [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2531.94s)]
*  You know anytime there's a politician reading and prepared speech. It feels a little you know, like [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2537.42s)]
*  Staged but but at least usually like the politician is participating in the contents of the speech [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2542.26s)]
*  Like the King's speech is just like just some guy being handed a document being like perform this, you know [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2547.38s)]
*  Yeah [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2552.04s)]
*  It's a guy like talking about the fix to the cost of living crisis wearing like a 16 million dollar coat [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2552.42s)]
*  From a palace like from the literal palace, you know [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2557.7599999999998s)]
*  like a golden living on like an allowance from the public and and and having a [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2560.4s)]
*  multi-billion dollar real estate empire, you know [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2565.24s)]
*  Really attuned to the cost of living crisis weird system [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2568.12s)]
*  There's a long time where I was really jealous of the British system because they had snap elections every once in a while [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2570.44s)]
*  But I don't know. I mean our systems fucked up to every systems little fun [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2574.64s)]
*  Yeah, there's just like a little peculiar really eccentric grass is always greener [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2577.52s)]
*  Switching gears hard here Ben [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2581.76s)]
*  So the past few weeks we have talked about the Pakistani government's decision that they made last month to deport all [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2583.64s)]
*  undocumented Afghan refugees back to Afghanistan [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2590.48s)]
*  This decision could impact up to 1.7 million people [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2593.44s)]
*  The Associated Press reported that nearly 300,000 Afghans have already left the country have already left Pakistan and gone back to Afghanistan [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2597.84s)]
*  to learn more about [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2605.6s)]
*  This decision and its impact we reached out to Elaha Omar the CEO and founder of an organization called [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2607.4s)]
*  uplift Afghanistan because don't forget we have had since the [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2615.0s)]
*  70s and 80s the Soviet Union invasion civil war and then 20 years of war led by the US [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2619.12s)]
*  Right. And so naturally comes out of this [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2626.8s)]
*  migration this [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2631.08s)]
*  1.6 million that's facing these [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2632.92s)]
*  Deportations and expulsions some have been there for decades their children's don't even speak [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2636.2s)]
*  Daddy or Pashto they speak Punjabi. They were born there. They have businesses there [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2641.8799999999997s)]
*  You also have people who fled Taliban persecution women human rights defenders prosecutors [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2647.52s)]
*  allies that worked with US [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2653.7599999999998s)]
*  military [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2656.72s)]
*  and just people [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2657.8399999999997s)]
*  Transit refugees who are there who have a pathway forward and waiting for that to open up [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2659.52s)]
*  they're trying to set a biometric so that they can get identity cards and [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2664.64s)]
*  Some of them who have no place to go continue to stay in these in this makeshift camp a friend of mine [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2670.2s)]
*  who's on the ground told me that the cue in [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2677.04s)]
*  this refugee camp the queue for food he estimated he saw [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2681.48s)]
*  6000 people waiting to get some ration of food [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2687.52s)]
*  So that's kind of paints the picture of what is happening and this is only about [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2692.7599999999998s)]
*  300,000 people who've returned [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2699.16s)]
*  imagine 1.6 million [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2701.68s)]
*  Afghanistan's been in the middle of so much chaos and the people who've paid the price are the most vulnerable all are the [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2704.6s)]
*  Disabled are the children as a humanitarian organization, you know our response is that there is a harsh winter coming up [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2712.7799999999997s)]
*  our immediate focus is [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2720.98s)]
*  Addressing that winter and how to keep these families fed and keep them warm and [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2724.42s)]
*  Give shelter to them. I mean just [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2731.7799999999997s)]
*  Just a devastating decision. I mean, this is this is gonna let tens of not hundred thousand people are gonna die [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2734.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and you know there's to build on that really powerful, you know testimony [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2739.98s)]
*  first of all [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2745.1s)]
*  the Pakistani government is complicit in the fact that there are refugees in Pakistan because they prolonged that 20-year war by [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2745.7799999999997s)]
*  Providing a safe haven for the Taliban the safe the Taliban was based in Quetta in [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2753.8199999999997s)]
*  Pakistan throughout the war like so it's not like Pakistan was only absorbing refugees [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2759.2599999999998s)]
*  They were like a party in a way to this conflict [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2764.2599999999998s)]
*  The second point that I've been thinking about Tommy too is it you know, there's this kind of crazy [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2767.26s)]
*  You know, we've covered Imran Khan being ousted and there's this very weak civilian government [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2771.3s)]
*  There's elections are supposed to happen [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2775.9s)]
*  So even how this decision got made is kind of murky if you try to read about it [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2777.7400000000002s)]
*  Because you know the military really control things and there's an intelligence, you know arm [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2781.3s)]
*  and then there's this kind of weak civilian government and this kind of effort to just [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2785.46s)]
*  Because people are probably pissed about a lot of things in Pakistan demagogue like a migrant community [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2788.98s)]
*  That is huge and basically is analogous to our dreamers all being deported here except they're in much worse circumstances [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2793.74s)]
*  It's just a horrific and and bizarre [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2800.98s)]
*  decision and then if you read under the other piece I'd add to her and looking at this is you know, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2804.1s)]
*  Some some of this is like people Pakistanis are [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2809.06s)]
*  Expropriating the homes and businesses of some of these Afghans that are being displaced. It's pretty gross, you know [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2813.74s)]
*  But at the same time they're also gonna lose a workforce [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2819.9399999999996s)]
*  I mean, it's just [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2821.7799999999997s)]
*  Afghanistan can't absorb this they're being sent back to the Taliban is you know [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2823.66s)]
*  So if you're a woman you're being sent back to like a third-class citizenship [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2828.06s)]
*  It's horrible and some uplift Afghanistan part of what they do that is interesting is they they do cash [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2832.4599999999996s)]
*  You know, they try to get resources directly to people like you're saying which is a way to not have to go through the Taliban [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2837.8999999999996s)]
*  You know [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2843.3399999999997s)]
*  And so it does speak to this kind of new form of development where like the best thing you can do for some people sometimes [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2843.7799999999997s)]
*  Is just get them resources. Yeah, well check out uplift Afghanistan. Give it a Google to see what they're up to [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2848.86s)]
*  Maybe maybe chip in some cash if you can [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2853.42s)]
*  then pour one out for commuters in San Francisco this week because the Asia Pacific economic cooperation or APEC summit is [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2855.98s)]
*  Coming to town the big news out of this summit is that Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping are set to meet face-to-face [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2863.86s)]
*  These two last met on the sidelines of the G20 in Bali in November of 2022 then there was that whole [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2870.86s)]
*  Bit of a mess [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2879.26s)]
*  Relations got rocky again. Let's say so we're shooting down like, you know science experiments in this [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2880.78s)]
*  Yeah, we're just whacking weather balloons left and right. What a dumb six months I was Biden and she you're expected to talk about trade [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2884.86s)]
*  Potentially reestablishing military to military talks that China cut off after Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in 2022 [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2891.7000000000003s)]
*  You're gonna talk about AI [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2897.96s)]
*  I'll probably talk about the stopping the export of chemicals used to make fentanyl a whole bunch of items on the to-do list [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2899.02s)]
*  The entire 21 member summit is is gonna focus on trade and economic growth [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2905.7400000000002s)]
*  The White House is expected to announce a trade deal with about a dozen other Asian countries while there [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2910.06s)]
*  Well, there's some anxiety from the left and Democratic Party about this potential deal [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2915.5s)]
*  Then what are you watching out for at this event? And what do you think all smooth sailing with China from here on out? [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2920.7400000000002s)]
*  I mean look, I think this is a meeting for the sake of having a meeting which is not a bad thing [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2925.66s)]
*  It's a good thing. I mean, I think they're trying to essentially, you know [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2930.8s)]
*  Diplo speak would be put a floor under the relationship [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2934.7000000000003s)]
*  But essentially the US China relationship has been in some kind of freefall [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2937.06s)]
*  The fact that the president United States and the president China have not met in like a year is very strange [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2940.06s)]
*  Look in a non kovat times [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2945.1800000000003s)]
*  Xi Jinping hasn't been to the United States and since 2017 I think and so just resuming this communication [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2948.46s)]
*  They will actually make everybody happy at that summit because other countries get pretty uncomfortable in the US and China or that much at odds [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2955.6000000000004s)]
*  Hopefully it opens up space for communication between the governments [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2961.7200000000003s)]
*  Milter to military ties would be a good thing because it kind of allows for almost like a hotline [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2964.56s)]
*  So you don't have some incident in the South China Sea or the Taiwan Strait blow up? [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2969.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm tired of seeing you know [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2972.54s)]
*  a little clips on Twitter of like Chinese fighter jets within six feet of some US aircraft or like, you know a [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2974.0s)]
*  Chinese destroyer cutting off some American boat or a Filipino fishing boat like there's too many incidents like that are happening too often [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2981.2400000000002s)]
*  Or a 30-minute segment led by Hugh Hewitt and a Republican debate about ships, you know, and we'll put that aside [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2987.74s)]
*  And then the AI stuff is interesting too because what's been reported out is that the US wants to discuss not having AI [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=2994.8599999999997s)]
*  Involved in the management of your nuclear weapons enterprise, which seems seems like [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3001.9399999999996s)]
*  It does indicate that we we should probably be talking the Chinese about these AI issues [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3006.1s)]
*  But the big but here is they're not even gonna have like a joint statement [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3011.18s)]
*  There's not like this is not gonna be some breakthrough [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3014.7799999999997s)]
*  This is just about preventing freefall [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3017.3399999999997s)]
*  I mean no military to military is like your most baseline thing that you want to be doing [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3019.52s)]
*  So there's not a huge breakthrough in a bunch of different areas [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3023.42s)]
*  But hopefully it allows for some more engagement so that we're not just in the spiral into Cold War [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3026.42s)]
*  How about the NBC debate in the Republican primary debate where they just pushed the five candidates who showed up to the right on every [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3032.7799999999997s)]
*  possible issue like Cold War with China [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3039.52s)]
*  Or retaliation against Iran what else was it was like Venezuela sanctions was like every issue they could think of they just pushed them to the right [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3042.26s)]
*  Yeah, it's so interesting. They'd like it's still the default position in American politics [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3050.7400000000002s)]
*  It's like problematic to not move further to the right on things [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3055.5800000000004s)]
*  particularly because [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3059.02s)]
*  That's actually not where the American public is on most of this stuff, too [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3060.2200000000003s)]
*  like the American public doesn't share all these views about you know getting into more wars or [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3063.5800000000004s)]
*  Probably even like building more ships, you know like no it sounds crazy. Yeah to meet you hewitt's like, you know [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3069.74s)]
*  Game of risk approach to looking at you know counting up Chinese boats and trying to match them with our boats [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3076.62s)]

*  Iran is in the background. So there is a lot of also fear about the potential expansion of [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3335.2200000000003s)]
*  of the conflict [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3342.66s)]
*  and [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3344.42s)]
*  There is also some hope [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3345.7s)]
*  You know that somehow [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3347.7799999999997s)]
*  The country will come out of this [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3349.7799999999997s)]
*  More united and also that's almost against all hope it would be possible to restart [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3352.98s)]
*  A peace process with the palestinians [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3360.1s)]
*  Again, it sounds almost [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3363.06s)]
*  inconceivable at the present moment [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3365.68s)]
*  but you know in uh, uh four years after yom kippur war in 1973 [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3367.7s)]
*  There was the peace process with egypt [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3373.4s)]
*  So who knows maybe there is some hope yeah [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3377.08s)]
*  I hope there is hope and I too am worried about the the escalation risks you talked about especially when I see reports that the u.s [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3380.76s)]
*  Military is striking targets in syria, uh linked to iran over and over again [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3386.52s)]
*  You had this great up ad on october 19th in the washington post where you wrote quote [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3392.1200000000003s)]
*  As the bodies keep piling up who will win this war not the side that kills more people [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3397.64s)]
*  Not the side that destroys more houses and not even the side that gains more international support [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3401.7999999999997s)]
*  But the side that achieves its political aims [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3407.0s)]
*  I'm wondering if you know nearly a month later [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3410.2799999999997s)]
*  You have a sense of which side is doing a better job achieving those political aims [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3413.72s)]
*  It's still too soon to tell i'm a historian, you know of hundreds of years of thousands of years [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3419.08s)]
*  So so a few weeks is is not enough [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3423.8799999999997s)]
*  Um, maybe we start by asking what are the political goals of the two sides? I think it's easier in the case of hamas [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3426.6s)]
*  That at least as far as I understand the immediate background to the attack that hamas launched on the 7th of october [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3434.92s)]
*  Was the potential for an israeli saudi peace treaty? [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3443.88s)]
*  That according to many credible sources, maybe we were just weeks [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3448.44s)]
*  From uh this kind of of treaty between israel and saudi arabia with american [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3453.16s)]
*  Uh, also, of course helping to achieve it this treaty was supposed not just to normalize relations [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3459.64s)]
*  between israel and saudi arabia also, uh to normalize relations between israel and most of the arab world [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3467.56s)]
*  uh to give some concessions to the palestinians [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3475.8s)]
*  And hopefully even to restart the israeli palestinian peace process [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3479.7999999999997s)]
*  And the background to that was this huge plan [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3485.24s)]
*  to build an infrastructure corridor leading from india and the persian gulf [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3489.3199999999997s)]
*  Through saudi arabia and jordan to israel and from there to the mediterranean europe [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3496.2799999999997s)]
*  Now all that was a very big threat [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3502.2799999999997s)]
*  To hamas and to its backers in iran [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3505.96s)]
*  Who oppose any approachment between israel and the arab countries like saudi arabia and any chance [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3510.8399999999997s)]
*  for a peaceful settlement [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3518.2s)]
*  for the israeli palestinian conflict [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3520.2799999999997s)]
*  And this was the the reason that hamas struck on the 7th of october to derail [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3523.0s)]
*  This uh potential peace treaty [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3529.64s)]
*  So far it has been successful [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3532.68s)]
*  I mean the peace treaty is at the moment shelved [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3535.24s)]
*  but um, we don't know [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3538.68s)]
*  maybe after the [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3541.16s)]
*  Some kind of ceasefire or some kind of end of hostilities is reached we will see the [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3543.64s)]
*  israeli saudi treaty back on the table [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3550.2599999999998s)]
*  Maybe even expanded and that's the big question [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3553.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean if this war ends [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3557.3999999999996s)]
*  With without normalization between israel and the arab world and without some kind of of [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3560.04s)]
*  Restarting the peace process then hamas has won [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3568.02s)]
*  now [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3571.7200000000003s)]
*  The question with israel is more complicated because it's not so clear [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3572.6800000000003s)]
*  Whether israel's aims political aims are the exact opposite of hamas [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3577.64s)]
*  I hope they are I hope that israel's war aims [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3584.36s)]
*  Is to come out of this conflict in a position [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3588.6s)]
*  To achieve peace with an normalization with the arab world [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3593.0s)]
*  Again, the the the logic of the war should be [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3598.44s)]
*  That because hamas does everything in its power not just now but for years [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3602.04s)]
*  To foil any chance for peace. So if you want to have peace you need first of all to disarm hamas [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3607.56s)]
*  If this is the logic of the war it makes sense [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3613.88s)]
*  But you do hear extremist voices in israel including in the netanyahu coalition who think in very different terms [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3616.92s)]
*  And so far the israeli government has not made it clear enough [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3625.4s)]
*  What are its long-term goals? It's speaking about the need to disarm hamas [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3630.76s)]
*  Okay, that's understandable. But what comes after that is far less clear [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3636.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I I understand the desire to disarm hamas [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3640.92s)]
*  I mean, I certainly remember how america felt after 9 11 we wanted [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3644.12s)]
*  To feel safe again. We wanted vengeance frankly [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3647.56s)]
*  And I can only imagine how those fears and feelings would be magnified if al-qaeda had been living just over the border in canada [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3649.96s)]
*  for example, but I also I mean I worry that [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3656.3599999999997s)]
*  Israel is getting pulled into a similar trap that we did because it does seem like terrorist groups like hamas and al-qaeda [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3660.8399999999997s)]
*  Want not just to foil the saudi normalization talks [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3666.92s)]
*  But a broader war to get back on the radar screen of the entire arab world [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3669.8s)]
*  And that hamas did what they did with the goal of getting an outsized [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3674.28s)]
*  Military response to you know, sort of raise those images and create those narratives again [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3679.1600000000003s)]
*  I mean knowing that knowing that that is likely hamas's goal [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3684.52s)]
*  Do you think there's space in israel for voices trying to sort of make that case and urge restraint? [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3689.1600000000003s)]
*  Um, there is space the voices are there what will be again the the outcome on the ground? [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3694.84s)]
*  I don't know. I i'm not part of these discussions in the military in the government [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3700.92s)]
*  And really it's just too soon to tell unfortunately [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3706.84s)]
*  This is likely to be in one way or the other quite a long conflict [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3710.84s)]
*  Um, I can only say that in the long term. I think that israel's political aims should be [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3716.6s)]
*  Normalization with the arab world and peace with the palestinians on the basis of the understanding [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3724.02s)]
*  That the palestinians must be given [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3731.1600000000003s)]
*  Uh the the ability to live dignified lives in their homeland [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3734.36s)]
*  How to achieve that that's a huge huge problem again. It should be clear that disarming hamas is necessary [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3740.2000000000003s)]
*  because hamas opposes [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3747.56s)]
*  Uh any such efforts and from its very foundations more than 30 years ago. This was its entire logic [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3749.72s)]
*  It's raison d'etre [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3756.36s)]
*  And it repeatedly every time that there was a chance for peace [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3757.88s)]
*  It used its military force in order to foil these [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3763.32s)]
*  Uh, uh, the the peace process and it's likely to do so again [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3768.04s)]
*  So this is the rationale behind saying we need to disarm hamas [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3772.68s)]
*  Of course just disarming it without giving the palestinians [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3776.6800000000003s)]
*  Um a different potential future again a future of dignified lives in their homeland [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3781.08s)]
*  Will just get something similar or something even worse a couple of years down the line [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3787.08s)]
*  Well, yeah, let's talk about what that that future for palestinians could be like because in america you still hear [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3792.28s)]
*  And in the west frankly people defaulting to talking about the two-state solution [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3798.36s)]
*  Uh in a palestinian state [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3802.76s)]
*  Do [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3805.7200000000003s)]
*  Do but that feels very challenging given the current palestinian leadership and given netanyahu and his coalition [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3806.6800000000003s)]
*  Do israelis still think a two-state solution is viable? [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3813.0800000000004s)]
*  And if not, what what other alternatives are being discussed in this sort of political space? [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3816.5200000000004s)]
*  You know, there are all kinds of alternatives, but what we need to understand about [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3820.6800000000003s)]
*  These kinds of of ethnic conflicts and national conflicts [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3825.48s)]
*  It's not like a problem in mathematics [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3829.88s)]
*  When the question is does the problem have a solution yes or no? [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3833.0s)]
*  And you can prove mathematically that a certain problem has no solution or a certain problem has three different solutions [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3838.04s)]
*  One two three [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3846.04s)]
*  In history doesn't work like that [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3847.4s)]
*  there are [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3849.96s)]
*  potential solutions [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3851.0s)]
*  The only question always is motivation [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3852.7599999999998s)]
*  If you have enough motivation [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3856.68s)]
*  On both sides [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3859.3999999999996s)]
*  You can have a solution of different kinds two two states some kind of confederation all kinds of things [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3861.24s)]
*  If you don't have motivation [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3867.7999999999997s)]
*  there is no solution and [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3870.04s)]
*  uh, even more importantly the motivation has to be on both sides [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3872.68s)]
*  To wage war you need motivation only on one side. That's enough [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3878.04s)]
*  But to have peace you need motivation on both sides [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3882.68s)]
*  And i'm not an expert on that but my impression from living here for last [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3885.96s)]
*  47 years is that in recent years and certainly at present there is not enough motivation on either side [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3891.32s)]
*  uh, uh to to to solve the conflict to make peace [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3900.2s)]
*  We need to gradually build up that motivation. That's the task. I mean there won't be any [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3903.88s)]
*  Uh solution to the conflict in the next few weeks or months [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3909.88s)]
*  But hopefully we can now sow seeds [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3914.76s)]
*  That down the line will make it possible for israelis and palestinians to live side by side [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3918.28s)]
*  How long would it take? I don't know [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3924.6800000000003s)]
*  but again at the present moment both sides are just [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3927.2400000000002s)]
*  Our minds are full to the brim with immense pain [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3932.36s)]
*  And there is no ability to even acknowledge [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3936.84s)]
*  The pain and the interests and the viewpoint of the other side [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3940.92s)]
*  There is no, you know theory of mind the ability to get into the mind of an [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3945.2400000000002s)]
*  Person and understand how reality looks from that perspective. There is no theory of mind on either side [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3950.76s)]
*  but um [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3958.12s)]
*  Eventually we can get there, you know if 75 years or 80 years after the holocaust [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3959.7200000000003s)]
*  Germans and jews are now good friends. I think it's not impossible also for israelis and palestinians [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3965.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's good perspective to bring and you're right though that you know [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3972.52s)]
*  The maps for what a two-state solution could look like have existed for decades [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3975.7200000000003s)]
*  What has not existed is the political will to get the deal done. Um, [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3979.7200000000003s)]
*  There have been lots of reports of israelis who have been uh, or ever israelis as well [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3984.2000000000003s)]
*  Who've been critical of the military response in gaza saying they've been censored. They've been visited by [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3989.48s)]
*  Security forces. What is the environment like in israel right now for in terms of free speech? [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3994.6s)]
*  You know, we've been fighting israelis for nine months before [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=3999.24s)]
*  the war erupted [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4004.3599999999997s)]
*  to preserve [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4006.04s)]
*  israeli democracy to preserve independent courts and free speech and independent media and [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4007.3199999999997s)]
*  So far we have been successful. There is still considerable room in israel [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4014.44s)]
*  for uh [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4019.88s)]
*  For free speech, of course at the height of the in many ways the worst [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4021.08s)]
*  Moment in the history of the country since its establishment [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4026.92s)]
*  Uh, the limits of free speech are more narrow than they were before the 7th of october, but there is still considerable room [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4031.0s)]
*  I mean people are not [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4039.56s)]
*  Disappeared in the middle of the night or arrested or murdered for speaking [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4041.4s)]
*  their minds [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4047.4s)]
*  There are dangerous signs of erosion in freedom of speech [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4049.0s)]
*  Whether it is warnings from police whether it's people being fired from work. We need to be extremely careful about it [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4055.08s)]
*  if israel [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4061.48s)]
*  You know wins the military [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4063.08s)]
*  struggle [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4066.28s)]
*  But loses its democracy in the process that is a complete defeat for us [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4067.48s)]
*  So in the u.s [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4072.92s)]
*  Uh, the language about the conflict has become central to the debate [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4074.36s)]
*  I I would argue in very unhelpful ways often we had a palestinian member of congress censored for using the term from the river [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4078.28s)]
*  to the sea [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4084.52s)]
*  Uh, many folks on the left seem to focus their activism on demanding that others call the israeli military effort a genocide [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4085.48s)]
*  I was wondering as a historian [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4093.2400000000002s)]
*  How important you think the language choices we're making are? [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4095.32s)]
*  Uh to the debate and to efforts to sort of bear witness to what's happening and also push back on the war as it's unfolding [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4099.400000000001s)]
*  Well, I have two things to say first of all that um words are important, but don't give them too much importance [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4106.6s)]
*  In the end what really matters is the experiences the pain the suffering the events on the ground [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4113.320000000001s)]
*  And something that we see looking from now from israel looking the united states is almost like the the conflict has been hijacked [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4120.280000000001s)]
*  And people are using it [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4128.6s)]
*  Uh in in their own internal struggles in the united states about issues that really have nothing to do with us [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4130.6s)]
*  and that uh, uh [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4138.04s)]
*  It's like the real victims are now people in the united states who are not allowed or are allowed to say this or to say that [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4140.04s)]
*  And it's not about you [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4148.6s)]
*  But if you're really interested in the conflict [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4150.84s)]
*  Then uh all these questions of of language and and and the limits of freedom of speech [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4154.38s)]
*  Into united states or in europe they should take a back seat and we should try to focus on what are the facts? [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4160.86s)]
*  And not necessarily on how do we call them? [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4168.38s)]
*  Because we know it's endless these arguments these semantic arguments people can use words in almost any way they like [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4171.98s)]
*  And related to that the second point is that there is a tendency [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4179.5s)]
*  For words to suffer from inflation in the same way that money suffers from inflation [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4183.74s)]
*  That uh words like genocide that has been originally reserved [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4190.3s)]
*  For some extreme historical cases and are now being used [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4195.66s)]
*  Uh in in all kinds of expand expanded or even metaphorical ways, you know people have been [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4200.46s)]
*  Talking about israel committing genocide in gaza not just in in the recent months [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4207.0199999999995s)]
*  But for years and decades [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4212.299999999999s)]
*  and part of what happens even if you have [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4214.459999999999s)]
*  Certain, I don't know good intentions in using this language over time people just get used to it. It's like [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4218.0599999999995s)]
*  Again, i'll give an example also from within israeli politics that once upon a time in israel to call somebody [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4225.259999999999s)]
*  Let's say a politician [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4232.62s)]
*  or a member of some [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4234.219999999999s)]
*  party and nazi [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4235.98s)]
*  Was such a shocking thing that the entire country would stand still if somebody dared call if a jew [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4237.82s)]
*  Dared called another jew a nazi [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4245.179999999999s)]
*  Today, it's this this currency has been completely kind of of of uh lost all its value [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4247.58s)]
*  so, um, I would say [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4254.46s)]
*  Words are important, but be careful not to give them too much importance and not to uh, uh [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4256.86s)]
*  Use them in a way that eventually causes them to lose all their meaning. Yeah well said I mean, uh, [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4264.06s)]
*  I think the thing about nazi comparisons is that you should never make them because uh, it was a singular evil in our history [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4270.54s)]
*  And let's uh, let's leave it there [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4277.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's just the worst. Um, the final question for you you wrote in, uh, harret's, uh [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4279.9s)]
*  quote we need an israeli charter to explain how our lives will look after victory is achieved and the positive goals for which millions of [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4285.02s)]
*  Soldiers and civilians are being required to risk and even sacrifice their lives [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4291.18s)]
*  Do you think anyone is working on that charter? [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4295.02s)]
*  And do you think that charter can be written if bb net yahoo and this coalition are still in power? [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4297.820000000001s)]
*  Unfortunately, not I mean the same way that the israeli government itself didn't state [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4302.92s)]
*  Clearly what are the political aims of of the war? It also didn't tell the israeli public [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4308.52s)]
*  Uh, what kind of country we will have? [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4317.02s)]
*  Uh after the war [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4320.38s)]
*  And you know, we are now paying the price [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4322.54s)]
*  for being ruled for many years [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4325.82s)]
*  by a populist strongman [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4329.42s)]
*  Who based his political career on dividing the nation against itself? [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4332.219999999999s)]
*  on vilifying his political rivals [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4338.3s)]
*  as as traitors [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4341.66s)]
*  and as enemies [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4343.66s)]
*  um on [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4346.0599999999995s)]
*  Appointing people to office just based on on political loyalty to himself and not on competence [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4347.66s)]
*  On vilifying the elites of the country [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4354.0599999999995s)]
*  The people who are foremost in serving the nation in the military in the judicial system in in other institutions [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4357.34s)]
*  as as as dangerous again as as a deep state [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4365.98s)]
*  traitorous elite [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4370.36s)]
*  And we are now paying the the price for that [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4372.139999999999s)]
*  And we need to bring the nation together [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4375.26s)]
*  And for that we need a clear statement about what we are fighting for beyond just disarming hamas [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4379.18s)]
*  and bringing back security [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4386.860000000001s)]
*  for for israelis [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4388.9400000000005s)]
*  And to give some concrete examples [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4391.26s)]
*  On the 7th of october, it wasn't just jewish israelis who are murdered [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4393.900000000001s)]
*  There are also many cases [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4399.1s)]
*  Of muslim and christian israelis who are murdered or kidnapped by hamas [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4401.26s)]
*  Among the security forces who risked and sometimes sacrificed their lives [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4407.42s)]
*  To protect civilians the were muslims and christians [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4412.780000000001s)]
*  And we need a clear statement that after the war [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4417.1s)]
*  They and their families will be completely equal citizens of the israeli state [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4421.42s)]
*  Similarly, there have been a famous case [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4427.320000000001s)]
*  of a captain in the army [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4431.1s)]
*  Who was killed on the 7th of october trying to save civilians a week before he was due to marry his boyfriend [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4433.9800000000005s)]
*  and [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4442.860000000001s)]
*  even though the army was was quite quick to say that the the [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4444.06s)]
*  Widower will be will receive all the all the treatment and benefits [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4451.240000000001s)]
*  Like in in heterosexual couples [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4457.18s)]
*  We need to hear it clearly [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4459.820000000001s)]
*  That uh the state will treat after the war not just all its soldiers, but all its civilians equally [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4461.820000000001s)]
*  and like that [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4468.46s)]
*  We need to hear a clear vision [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4470.46s)]
*  That israel after the war will be a liberal democracy [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4474.38s)]
*  That will respect and guarantee the rights of all its citizens [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4479.820000000001s)]
*  And unfortunately so far we did not hear this clearly enough. Yeah, one final question if I may I mean [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4484.62s)]
*  You know, we're about five weeks into this this conflict now [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4491.5s)]
*  I know you've written that it's the job of those outside of the conflict to focus on peace in america [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4494.219999999999s)]
*  There are growing calls for a ceasefire. Do you think it's the appropriate time for a ceasefire? Are those calls being heard? [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4499.66s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, you know that depends a lot on the negotiations with regard to the hostages [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4505.58s)]
*  Yeah, on the question of whether a ceasefire will [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4511.26s)]
*  Liberate the hostages or make it more difficult to to liberate them on the specificities of the military situation [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4514.860000000001s)]
*  I I don't know [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4521.820000000001s)]
*  So I I leave that to to to people who are better informed about the situation and my focus is on the long term [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4522.780000000001s)]
*  Not on whether we have a a ceasefire for a few days [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4530.620000000001s)]
*  You know, we had a ceasefire on the 6th of october. It was then broken by hamas. So the question is how do we reach? [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4534.46s)]
*  Long-term peace which enable both israelis and palestinians to live safe [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4541.26s)]
*  And and and dignified lives in their homelands side by side. Well, listen, you've all thank you so much for uh for your focus on that [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4547.02s)]
*  Big picture long-term vision because uh, it's very easy to forget it in the midst of a horrific conflict like this [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4555.34s)]
*  And thank you so much for doing the show. Thank you very much then one last thing before we go [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4561.740000000001s)]
*  Did you see the washington post? [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4565.1s)]
*  Uh finally reported that yes, the ukrainians were behind the bombing of the north stream pipeline [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4566.78s)]
*  Yeah, and what was even crazier about is it seemed like it was a ukrainian leak [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4571.82s)]
*  Yeah, trying to like stick it on some other guy and be like i was on skidding about it [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4575.34s)]
*  But this guy he planned the whole thing, you know, yeah, and it's a huge deal, you know, it's a big deal [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4578.86s)]
*  I mean, I remember we covered it early [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4583.82s)]
*  We all I remember we definitely thought it was weird but then biden just sort of like named the russians as the culprits [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4585.099999999999s)]
*  So sort of yeah [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4590.38s)]
*  Actually, you know, is that gonna be? [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4592.22s)]
*  Corrected or addressed in any way. I don't know. I wonder I wonder if they want that one back [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4594.62s)]
*  They might want to take that back and the seymour's thing that like it was like some biden mastermind plot. Oh, yes [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4598.780000000001s)]
*  The cia fan cia fan flick stuff. Yeah. Yeah, that was not accurate [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4605.1s)]
*  But yeah, no, I mean like shout out to the washington post for seemingly nailing this reporting [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4610.7s)]
*  um, it is also interesting like these the sort of ukrainian [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4615.34s)]
*  Intelligence and military sort of special forces guys are getting increasingly public about their activities [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4618.94s)]
*  It does seem to like there's an interesting fighting in the ukrainian government like the lansky sacked a bunch of guys [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4624.54s)]
*  They didn't like that guy saying stalemate. They pinned the nord stream thing on this guy [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4629.74s)]
*  It does feel like there's an unsettled period after the counter-offensive didn't yield a lot of results where [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4634.22s)]
*  You know, there's some [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4639.9800000000005s)]

*  Does the cake say soft power too or is it just the balloons? Yeah [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IuVu13CmM&t=4689.0199999999995s)]
