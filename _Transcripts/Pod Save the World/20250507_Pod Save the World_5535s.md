# Trump and Netanyahu's Gaza Occupation Plan Enters Deadly New Phase
**Pod Save the World:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw)
*  Welcome to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Ben Rhodes. Ben, all the way live from Singapore. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=0.0s)]
*  You look very international right now. I mean, you know, Q International Hotel Room could be [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5.2s)]
*  anywhere. But yes, good morning. Good Wednesday morning, Tommy. It is Wednesday morning in [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=10.72s)]
*  Singapore where I which I love, by the way, because you can walk two blocks in any direction and eat [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=15.84s)]
*  a bowl of noodles. But I'm here for a philanthropy summit. I'm here to help support the Obama [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=22.0s)]
*  Foundation and its remarkable leaders here who I had dinner with last night. So yes, coming to you [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=29.84s)]
*  from the other side of the planet. Did you see Donald Trump attacked the Obama Presidential Library [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=35.2s)]
*  in his Oval Office meeting with Mark Carney? Yeah, I woke up to that. I actually didn't see the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=39.6s)]
*  specific report. But yeah, I'm probably not doing any favors for it by saying I'm here on its behalf [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=43.92s)]
*  in Singapore. Well, you're fine. He basically accused all the construction workers in Chicago [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=49.76s)]
*  of like doing land acknowledgments and screaming their pronouns and not like hammering and nails [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=54.559999999999995s)]
*  or something. So it's going slow. It was very, very stupid. Regardless, Ben, today's a tough day [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=58.48s)]
*  for me. A great one for you, even if it's a different day, because the Knicks beat the Celtics [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  in overtime in Game 1 of this playoff series and Boston losing one at home. I don't like that. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=69.28s)]
*  No, you never like to let the other team steal Game 1. I have to tell you, Tommy, I was up yesterday [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=75.44s)]
*  morning watching this and sports is so funny because I was so invested. When the Knicks came [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=79.12s)]
*  all the way back from 20 points down, I was like, you know, I always feel if you're the worst as a [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  Knicks fan. So I was like, first I was worried they're gonna get, exactly. I first was worried [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=91.28s)]
*  they'd get blown out. Then they came back. I was like, oh my God, if we come all the way back and [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=95.36000000000001s)]
*  lose, then that'll be awful. And so as it's like 100, 100, I'm sitting there, I'm not like a [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=99.36000000000001s)]
*  particularly religious person. And I'm like, everything has been so bad. Can I please just [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=105.28s)]
*  have this one nice thing? I'm praying to whatever force in the world could deliver the Knicks a [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  victory. So I'm glad that worked out for me. I'm still a little afraid of you guys, but less [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=117.52s)]
*  afraid than I was two days ago. Yeah, we got time. We'll come back. Good game, though. It's fun to [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=122.48s)]
*  watch. Just don't take 63 pointers. I don't understand if you're like Jason Tate or Jalen [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=127.76s)]
*  Brown. Just dribble towards the basket and shoot it. You don't need to pull up. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=131.2s)]
*  Especially if you're breaking them. Also, Ben, I want to say thank you to everyone who has subscribed [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=134.56s)]

*  recently, including we did a YouTube exclusive segment on reports that Trump had actually [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=141.28s)]
*  waved off an Israeli plan to bomb Iran's nuclear infrastructure. We did a segment last week about [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=146.0s)]
*  Mike Waltz getting fired as national security advisor and secretary of middle management, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=151.6s)]

*  just searching for political news. If they don't get it from us, they're going to get it from Ben [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=175.76s)]
*  Shapiro. So we really appreciate you subscribing. Today we're going to cover some big stories. We [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=180.88s)]
*  got the chaos that is now engulfed, not just Pete Hegseth over the Pentagon, but a big chunk of [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=185.28s)]
*  Trump's national security team. We're going to talk briefly about Canadian Prime Minister Mark [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=191.6s)]
*  Carney's visit to the Oval Office, the Israeli government's horrible new plan for Gaza, Trump's [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=195.76s)]
*  maybe real, maybe sort of bullshit deal with the Houthi rebels in Yemen, some sort of ceasefire, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  elections in Australia, the UK, Romania and Singapore, bit of a mixed bag there, how the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=208.64s)]
*  German government almost toppled before it was stood up earlier today, and why Trump officials [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=213.84s)]
*  are mad about the treatment of the far-right AFD party in Germany. Then we'll do a quick update [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=219.12s)]
*  on tensions between India and Pakistan. Then we will preview the Papal Conclave in the best way [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=223.28s)]
*  we know how. Then, Ben, have you done a mock draft or filled out your Papal bracket yet? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=229.68s)]
*  No, I haven't. Yeah, I'm just reading up on the Mel Kuiper big board of who the Cardinals are I [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=235.44s)]
*  should be watching. I wonder if Shidora will drop in this draft too. It's a bit difficult to tell. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=241.28s)]
*  Ben, you just did our interview at like whatever 6 a.m. or whatever Singapore time it is. What are [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=248.24s)]
*  folks going to hear? I talked to Clayton Weimers, who's the executive director of Reporters Up [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=252.56s)]
*  Orders in the U.S. and they released their global press freedom index last week around global press [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=256.72s)]
*  freedom day. Spoiler alert, Tommy, it's not going well for press freedoms around the world. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=263.28s)]
*  Bummer. But what was really interesting in this report and in this interview was talking about [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=267.84s)]
*  the kind of economic hurricane that has hit journalism globally as you have social media [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=274.0s)]
*  taking over your media deserts. But how authoritarians are increasingly interacting [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=281.67999999999995s)]
*  with that and Trump is doing this in the U.S. now where essentially they're seeing what's [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=286.4s)]
*  happening in terms of vulnerability and how they're using that to kind of further kill [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=290.55999999999995s)]
*  independent journalism or turn it into part of their authoritarian playbook. So we kind of [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=294.56s)]
*  cover that in the U.S. and also how it's affecting things globally. We talk about Gaza and what it [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=299.28000000000003s)]
*  means when the U.S. kind of totally turns a blind eye to any accountability for the killing of [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=305.2s)]
*  journalists in places like Gaza and the West Bank and kind of what people can do, like what kind of [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=310.0s)]
*  independent journalism is necessary. Also, importantly, the funding cuts for USAID and VOA, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=314.72s)]
*  Voice of America and overseas broadcasting. So not a great picture, but I think people need to [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=321.44s)]
*  get smart on this so they understand both what's happening but also how to support independent [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  journalism in this country and globally. Excellent. Everyone should check that out. It's a very, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=330.32s)]
*  very important topic. I think under discussed when it comes to the rise of authoritarianism. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=333.84s)]
*  Your mention of the Gaza piece of this reminded me that our friends over at Zateo News have a [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=337.84s)]
*  documentary coming out called Who Killed Shireen about the execution by the IDF of this famous [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=343.2s)]
*  Palestinian American journalist and the total lack of accountability for it during the Biden [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=350.64s)]
*  administration. So I'm looking forward to watching that. And we talk about that case on the interview [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=355.52s)]
*  as an exemplar of the wrong way to do it in terms of accountability. Absolute moral failing there. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=360.15999999999997s)]
*  All right, Ben. So let's start with the chaos in Trump's national security team because I do [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=368.0s)]
*  think it's like a big evolving story. As I mentioned at the top, Mike Waltz is out as [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=372.56s)]
*  national security advisor. Rubio was given the job on an interim basis and is now technically [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=376.64s)]
*  secretary of state, interim national security advisor, acting USAID administrator and acting [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=382.48s)]
*  archivist of the United States. So that makes a lot of sense. Waltz will be nominated to serve [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=387.76s)]
*  as US ambassador to the United Nations. I look forward to that confirmation hearing. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=392.88s)]
*  There's a bunch of new reporting about why Waltz got fired since we talked about this last week on [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=397.28s)]
*  YouTube. It sounds like part of it was obvious, like Trump never got over the signal gate fiasco [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=402.16s)]
*  and the weeks and weeks and weeks of bad headlines that followed. But additionally, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=407.6s)]
*  the Washington Post reported that Trump was pissed at Waltz for coordinating with the Israeli [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=411.04s)]
*  government before Prime Minister Netanyahu's visit to the White House back in February. I guess Waltz [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=415.20000000000005s)]
*  and the Israelis were talking about military options to target Iran's nuclear program when [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=421.20000000000005s)]
*  Trump wanted to try diplomacy first and that pissed him off. Also, as we've discussed, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=426.71999999999997s)]
*  it sounds like the rest of the White House just thought Mike Waltz was a moron and they hated [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=432.24s)]
*  working with him and they wanted him out. JD Vance went on TV, I think it was with Brett Baer on Fox, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=435.52s)]
*  and tried to describe Waltz's firing as a promotion because the job is Senate confirmed. I believe [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=441.59999999999997s)]
*  there's something like 1300 Senate confirmed jobs, Ben. So we all had a good laugh at that. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=447.44s)]
*  And here's Trump talking about these personal moves on Meet the Press this past weekend. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=452.4s)]
*  Mr. President, was that move a punishment? No, I just think he'll do a nice job in the new position. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=457.44s)]
*  Marco's doing an outstanding job. No, Marco won't keep, Marco's very busy doing other things, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=464.88s)]
*  so he's not going to keep it long term. We're going to put somebody else in. But I think Mike [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=469.92s)]
*  was, as you know, he's a fine guy and I think he'll do a very good job, knows the countries, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=474.0s)]
*  knows leadership, and I think he'll do a very good job at the United Nations. And in the meantime, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=477.84s)]
*  Marco's really doing something special and it's going to work out very well. We're hearing some [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=483.44s)]
*  potential names. Stephen Miller's name, one of your long time most loyal aides, his name has been [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=488.79999999999995s)]
*  talked about as a potential national security adviser. Is he someone you're looking for? Well, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=497.2s)]
*  I'd love to have Stephen there, but that would be a downgrade. Stephen's very, Stephen is much higher [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=501.03999999999996s)]
*  in the totem pole than that, in my opinion. Can you tell us who the front runner is right now? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=506.64s)]
*  I have a lot of people that want it. I will tell you, I have everybody calling. Everybody wants to [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=511.03999999999996s)]
*  be a part of this administration. So at some point we'll probably do that. There's a theory, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=514.96s)]
*  Henry Kissinger did both, there's a theory that you don't need two people, but I think I have [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=521.4399999999999s)]
*  some really great people that could do a good job. So calling Walt a fine guy is such a brutal [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=527.28s)]
*  description unless he meant fine and thinks he's hot. But Ben, so this change at the White House [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=533.28s)]
*  for the national security adviser position comes as this chaos around Hexeth just won't go away. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=541.28s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal reported that Hexeth made at least a dozen signal chats where he talked [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=545.28s)]
*  about sensitive information, including one where he told aides to, quote, inform foreign governments [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=549.6s)]
*  about an unfolding military operation. In that story, the Pentagon tossed Hexeth's military aid [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=553.76s)]
*  under the bus and told the journal that he was the guy who shared classified information [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=559.52s)]
*  with Pete Hexeth's wife and brother. But despite this mess, Ben, you can hear in that Meet the [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=563.84s)]
*  Press clip that Trump just doesn't really seem to think he needs a national security adviser or NSC [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=570.16s)]
*  staff. I don't know, maybe he just thinks he's the genius behind it all. Well, I think he does. I [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=575.1999999999999s)]
*  think he's his own national security adviser. And he wants to have these personal emissaries [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=581.12s)]
*  like Steve Woodcock flying around the world who have a direct line back into Trump rather than [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=586.4000000000001s)]
*  having a national security adviser coordinating the State Department, the Defense Department, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=590.5600000000001s)]
*  the intelligence community. The risk of that is the kind of chaos in the government, right? Because [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=594.24s)]
*  the national security adviser's job, which is, you know, with all due respect, I mean, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=599.9200000000001s)]
*  the UN ambassador job is more important in democratic administrations, but in Republican, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=604.8000000000001s)]
*  particularly Trump administrations, it's a massive demotion from that because the national adviser [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=608.72s)]
*  coordinates the UN ambassador, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense in terms of [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=613.04s)]
*  developing policy and implementing policy. Or if there's a crisis, like some of the things we're [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=617.68s)]
*  going to talk about today, you know, India bombs Pakistan, who convenes the meeting in the national [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=621.4399999999999s)]
*  security in the situation room to figure out how to respond to that, right? So there's just a huge [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=626.8s)]
*  vacuum in terms of being able to deal with particularly a crisis or being able to [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=631.1999999999999s)]
*  implement an objective. I worry too about the authoritarian playbook of this all, right? Because [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=636.96s)]
*  part of what you want to do if you want to truly consolidate power, you essentially debilitate the [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=644.48s)]
*  kind of normal workings of the government. You pull all decision making into the office of the [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=650.88s)]
*  president, and then you just deal with loyalists, you know? And that kind of brings us to the Stephen [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=656.96s)]
*  Miller and Hexeth of it all. Stephen Miller to me is the scariest guy to be in this job. First of [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=662.08s)]
*  all, it's kind of weird that Trump would think being national security adviser is a demotion from [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=668.24s)]
*  Stephen Miller being deputy chief of staff for policy. There's some weird world where Stephen [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=673.0400000000001s)]
*  Miller is like in charge of both domestic and national security policy, which is scary to me. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=678.32s)]
*  But I think the particularly dangerous thing about a guy like Miller is he is someone like [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=682.1600000000001s)]
*  the Project 2025 people who've looked at how to use national security authorities, right? So kind [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=687.2s)]
*  of post 9-11 authorities to deport people to El Salvador and Gulags or to impose tariffs. These [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=692.72s)]
*  are not things that have a lot of legal basis or any legal basis, say, in the case of terrorists, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=700.8000000000001s)]
*  but they're using these emergency authorities, right? And when we think about the more extreme [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=704.96s)]
*  examples, delaying an election or something or deploying the military in the streets, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=709.44s)]
*  all of that would be based on a quote unquote national emergency, a national security emergency. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=714.8s)]
*  And so that's why I don't want guys like Miller who've actually thought about that [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=719.5999999999999s)]
*  and that would be an alarming signal. And lastly on Hexeth is a lot of people say to me, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=723.5999999999999s)]
*  when Trump threatens to invade Greenland or Canada, which we'll get to today, or take back [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=731.92s)]
*  the Panama Canal, would the military actually do that? Well, you see Hexeth kind of purging [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=737.04s)]
*  generals and now wanting to kind of get rid of 20% of all generals. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=742.08s)]
*  What the Pentagon looks like in two years versus what it looks like today could be very different [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=747.6s)]
*  if they basically are trying to build a MAGA military or maybe within the military like a MAGA [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=753.84s)]
*  wing that they can count on for some of their more far-fetched things. However, I will say [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=758.8000000000001s)]
*  with Pete Hexeth, he's one of those people that his kind of gross incompetence and lack of any [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=764.0s)]
*  discipline kind of assures me. On the one hand, it's kind of scary that nobody's running the [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=770.5600000000001s)]
*  Pentagon, but on the other hand, it's maybe a good thing that the guy who might be in charge [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=775.76s)]
*  of trying to turn the military into something that would invade Canada is a guy who seems to [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=779.92s)]
*  day drink and has a makeup studio and is firing his own long-time loyalists. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=784.8s)]
*  So everyone around him. Yeah, it is. Yeah, I guess his inability to plan is helpful. Although [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=791.84s)]
*  Trump, amazingly, amazing moment on Meet the Press, Trump did actually rule out a military [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=796.96s)]
*  invasion of Canada. So I guess that's reassuring, but you're right about Stephen Miller. I mean, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=801.9200000000001s)]
*  he's like declaring in a national emergency that the latest Indiana Jones movie was filmed [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=807.44s)]
*  internationally. So God help us if there was something that really did happen. But [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=811.76s)]
*  I'm glad you brought up the India-Pakistan tensions as an example of why you want a [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=816.32s)]
*  national security advisor and a secretary of state because right now we'll get to the substance of [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=821.0400000000001s)]
*  this in a bit, but Marco Rubio should be calling his counterparts in India and in Pakistan and [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=826.08s)]
*  trying to calm things down. He should then go to the region and try to be there and kind of [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=830.8000000000001s)]
*  physically prevent a military escalation. And then the national security advisor should be [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=835.2800000000001s)]
*  sitting in Washington and running a process for contingency planning and where to get [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=839.36s)]
*  other parts of the national security establishment involved. If Hegseth wasn't a moron, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=844.64s)]
*  he would be calling his counterparts in both India and Pakistan and telling them to chill out. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=848.64s)]
*  Maybe Trump makes a call, right? You'd have to staff that. You'd have to develop a package [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=852.64s)]
*  for what the message looks like, what threats could look like. But Rubio just can't do both [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=856.72s)]
*  at once. That's not even a shot at him, even though I love taking shots at him. Nobody can [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=862.64s)]
*  physically do both of those jobs. Yeah. And this is a good example, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=866.3199999999999s)]
*  right? And you set this up well, Tommy, but the national security advisor would convene this [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=869.6s)]
*  meeting in response to something like this. The intelligence community would brief everybody in [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=874.56s)]
*  that meeting in the situation room about, hey, what do we know about what's going on in India [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=880.56s)]
*  and Pakistan? Then you'd make a plan for diplomatic engagement, which by the way, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=884.88s)]
*  would include outreach from people like the State Department and Marco Rubio to [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=889.3599999999999s)]
*  India and Pakistan, but also to all the other countries. They're called the Chinese. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=893.68s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Called the Chinese. Other countries that have influence in India and Pakistan, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=899.4399999999999s)]
*  you'd be trying to make sure that everybody's kind of speaking with one voice because [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=904.4s)]
*  India doesn't want the US to come and mediate it, but if they're hearing the same message from [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=908.24s)]
*  lots of countries, that's helpful. The military has contacts. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=913.12s)]
*  of Staff calling the chief of staff of the army or the military in both India and Pakistan would [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=917.36s)]
*  be part of this. Diplomatic security. What are we doing to secure our diplomatic facilities in [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=922.08s)]
*  India and Pakistan in case all hell breaks loose here? Thinking through worst case scenarios. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=927.2s)]
*  Who's watching the nuclear weapons? There's a lot of stuff to be doing. American citizens, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=932.72s)]
*  what services need to be surged to support American citizens who are in a potential [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=938.24s)]
*  conflict zone? I don't think that's happening or if it's happening, it's not being coordinated. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=942.0s)]
*  Marco Rubio as a national security advisor can't both run that process, brief the president and be [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=947.84s)]
*  the secretary of state. You just can't do that. Right? Doesn't even have a deputy and everyone [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=954.1600000000001s)]
*  else is just a mess. Last week, Reuters published this photo of Mike Waltz from a cabinet meeting [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=958.08s)]
*  where you could see the screen of his phone and on it he was using this app called TeleMessage. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=964.48s)]
*  TeleMessage is an Israeli developed app that was sold to some US company called Smarsh. I [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=969.6800000000001s)]
*  guess that's the actual name. Waltz and other administration officials used this app to archive [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=975.04s)]
*  their signal chats to, I assume, comply with the Presidential Records Act, which says you have to [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=980.64s)]
*  archive all of your communications and correspondence. But some hacker told a news [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=986.08s)]
*  outlet called 404 Media that he was able to hack the TeleMessage app in like 15 minutes and pull [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=991.12s)]
*  the names and contact info for hundreds of US government employees. So great work there. Again, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=997.68s)]
*  the operational security is strong. Reuters reported that in the first few days of the [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1002.72s)]
*  administration, Pete Hegseth may have halted military aid shipments to Ukraine without first [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1007.36s)]
*  telling the White House that he was going to do it. That is kind of a shocking process, Val. Again, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1012.8s)]
*  it would be good to have a national security advisor coordinating these things. And then [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1018.72s)]
*  finally, Ben, I just wanted to play a quick clip for you in case you missed it, because you were [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1022.32s)]
*  probably asleep when this happened. Newly elected Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1026.72s)]
*  in the Oval Office today. Here's a quick excerpt of how it went. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1031.3600000000001s)]
*  As you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1034.88s)]
*  That's true. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1038.88s)]
*  We're sitting in one right now, Buckingham Palace that you visited as well. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1039.44s)]
*  That's true. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1043.1999999999998s)]
*  Having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign last several months, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1045.04s)]
*  it's not for sale, it won't be for sale ever. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1050.6399999999999s)]
*  But never say never. Never say never. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1053.1999999999998s)]
*  Trump's talking a little less tough these days to our Canadian friends. He was talking shit [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1056.56s)]
*  about Justin Trudeau, but less so to Mark Carney there. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1060.2399999999998s)]
*  Carney's brushed this guy back. Carney's got a pretty strong mandate from the Canadian people. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1063.1999999999998s)]
*  Again, as we've discussed, I think Carney appears to have threatened to dump US bonds in the ways [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1069.92s)]
*  in treasuries, in the ways that could significantly impact the economy. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1076.24s)]
*  He's not being bullied. Compare Mark Carney to US law firms. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1082.48s)]
*  That approach works, capitulating to Trump does not work. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1088.4s)]
*  Trump is so incapable of dealing with someone punching him back that all he can be is like, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1091.8400000000001s)]
*  you never say never. That's hardly that tough. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1097.92s)]
*  He spends a lot of time yelling about Biden or Trudeau, not so much his counterparts. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1101.92s)]
*  There was a great episode of this podcast and YouTube show called Pablo Torre Finds Out [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1105.2s)]
*  about how Wayne Gretzky's relationship with Donald Trump and his refusal to just come out and say, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1110.24s)]
*  like, hey, Canada will never be the 51st state, has caused all these Canadians to be furious [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1117.6000000000001s)]
*  at Gretzky. It goes into the weirdness of Gretzky sitting in a box next to Cash Patel [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1125.2s)]
*  during those two games when Ovechkin tied and then broke his scoring record. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1132.32s)]
*  Highly recommend it then. It's right up your alley. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1137.28s)]
*  The MAGA international celebrities jet set. This is the weirdest collection of people. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1141.52s)]
*  It's a weird crew. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1147.2s)]
*  They're like, Wayne Gretzky. If you're the greatest hockey player of all time, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1148.0s)]
*  why do you want to hang out with Cash Patel? Even if your politics trend in the wrong direction, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1152.48s)]
*  like it's just something so lame about it. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1156.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's weird. I guess Patel is like a big hockey player. He plays on some club team in DC. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1160.48s)]
*  Oh yeah, I'm sure he's like the great one. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1166.64s)]
*  Gretzky, I think, became a Trump buddy after he retired and was living in New York, probably [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1170.16s)]
*  chasing around the same crew. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1176.72s)]
*  Do you think Cash Patel is having hockey games? Remember how Putin used to have those [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1178.4s)]
*  hockey games where he would win against pro players, like 72 to nothing or something? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1182.72s)]
*  Do you think Cash Patel organizes scrimmages at the FBI where he has to be allowed to score? [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1187.68s)]
*  According to this report, apparently Cash Patel has a standing Sunday night game and some of the [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1193.3600000000001s)]
*  reporting around it, I think they talked to some of the players on his team who said that the FBI [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1198.16s)]
*  knows not to bug him during this period. Boy, that's not how the FBI director job operated [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1203.1200000000001s)]
*  back in our day, Ben. Also, Cash Patel lives in Las Vegas, so the fact that he's going to DC [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1208.32s)]
*  still for his club hockey game, obviously, has a lot of reasons to be in DC. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1213.36s)]
*  But it's worth watching. It was eye-opening. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1217.28s)]
*  I'll take it out. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1220.3999999999999s)]
*  Anyway, a couple additional Trump things. The Washington Post reported that the CIA may be [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1221.4399999999998s)]
*  planning to reduce its workforce by about 1,200 jobs via early retirements or buyouts. I'll be [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1225.12s)]
*  honest, I'm not that worked up about that one agency probably shrinking a bit. Pete Hegseth [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1230.96s)]
*  announced something similar. He's going to clean out some of the senior leadership at the Pentagon. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1236.8799999999999s)]
*  He's telling the military to cut 20% of its four-star generals, and he's telling the National [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1240.56s)]
*  Guard to get rid of 20% of its top positions. Here's our boy, Pistol Pete, talking about this [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1245.68s)]
*  plan in this weird video that the Department of Defense released via Twitter. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1251.2s)]
*  We're back with more DOD reforms. This one is General and Flag Officer Reductions. That's the [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1256.72s)]
*  official title. My title is Less Generals, More GIs. So it used to be a ratio of one general [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1263.28s)]
*  to 6,000 troops. Today, it's one general to 1,400. More generals and admirals does not equal more [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1271.04s)]
*  success. Now, this is not a slash and burn exercise meant to punish high-ranking officers. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1279.52s)]
*  Nothing could be further from the truth. This has been a deliberative process working with the joint [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1284.6399999999999s)]
*  chiefs of staff with one goal, maximizing strategic readiness and operational effectiveness by making [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1290.72s)]
*  prudent reductions in the general and flag officer ranks. Sturring stuff. Those watching on YouTube [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1297.52s)]
*  may notice that Hegseth filmed this video with a two-camera shoot, but they still had this former [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1303.52s)]
*  TV anchor reading off a piece of paper, not a teleprompter, which just seemed like very dumb. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1310.08s)]
*  Come on, guys. The Pentagon's got to have a teleprompter over there. Again, Ben, on the [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1314.24s)]
*  substance, I don't think that worked up about a reduction of four-star generals if it's done [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1317.6s)]
*  as described, but I do worry about these cuts being just cover for an ideological purge. Also, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1323.12s)]
*  some related bad news. The Supreme Court just said that Trump can ban transgender service members. So [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1329.6s)]
*  that is obviously terrible. The worst thing about this, and I alluded to it earlier, but to be [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1334.8799999999999s)]
*  specific, the worst things Trump could do involve the weaponization of the US military. So the [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1339.52s)]
*  deployment of the US military to quash dissent in this country. The use of the US military after an [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1346.56s)]
*  election that Trump or the Republicans used to ... We know after Trump lost last time that there [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1352.32s)]
*  were proposals to use the military under the Insurrection Act or some other kind of authority [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1359.44s)]
*  to kind of seize control, or overseas. Not just Canada, but the US military being ordered to seize [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1364.32s)]
*  the Panama Canal or seize Greenland. I don't think the US military would be willing to do some of [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1372.0s)]
*  those things in its current form. The 20% cut to general officers is kind of a precursor to a broader [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1381.2s)]
*  kind of purge and the promotion and elevation of a leadership that is kind of in Pete Hegs's image. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1390.0s)]
*  Then all of a sudden, the military in two years, when Trump may want to do some of those things, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1396.8000000000002s)]
*  is scarier. And look, maybe they'll just do parades on Trump's birthday. That's a different thing. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1402.96s)]
*  But that's the only thing that we worry about there. You're right. I'm not sure. There can be [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1408.5600000000002s)]
*  less four-star generals. That's fine. That doesn't stress me out. So the question is, is that a part [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1412.72s)]
*  though of a bigger project? Then the other thing I just say on the CIA piece, same thing I agree with [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1417.68s)]
*  you. But there's a difference between early retirements. But we saw in USAID, they were [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1422.08s)]
*  firing people that were overseas and leaving them there. If there are CIA officers who are serving [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1426.1599999999999s)]
*  overseas who are shit-canned and the rug is pulled out from under them, guess who's going to be [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1431.6s)]
*  approaching all of those CIA officers? China, Russia, and they have human sources who's obviously [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1438.08s)]
*  at stake. So again, there's a smart way to have some early retirement, downsize the force. And [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1445.4399999999998s)]
*  then there's a dumb doge way, like we saw in USAID, that would be potentially dangerous. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1450.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's very, very well said. You said, I believe you mentioned military parades, Ben. I [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1455.2s)]
*  got some news for you then. Trump is finally getting the military parade he has always dreamed [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1459.9199999999998s)]
*  of. So on June 14th, we will all be celebrating the 250th anniversary of the US Army and Flag Day [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1465.2s)]
*  and Trump's 79th birthday. So I'd rank those from least to most important. The parade will cost an [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1471.6799999999998s)]
*  estimated $45 million. It will include more than 50 aircraft, 150 military vehicles, and 6,600 [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1478.32s)]
*  soldiers. Here's Trump talking about his birthday parade again on Meet the Press. We're going to [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1485.36s)]
*  have a big, beautiful parade. A military parade? Yeah, sure. We're going to celebrate our military. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1490.6399999999999s)]
*  We have the greatest military in the world. What's the price tag? People, peanuts compared to the value of doing it. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1495.4399999999998s)]
*  We have the greatest missiles in the world. We have the greatest submarines in the world. We have the [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1502.32s)]
*  greatest army tanks in the world. We have the greatest weapons in the world and we're going to celebrate it. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1506.96s)]
*  If you look at Russia, they celebrate Victory Day. If you look at France, I was talking to [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1512.8s)]
*  Prime Minister Macron and he says, yes, there's Victory Day, Victory Day. And I say, Victory Day [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1519.52s)]
*  for what? World War II. I said, well, we had more to do with winning World War II than any other nation. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1525.1200000000001s)]
*  Why don't we have a Victory Day? So we're going to have a Victory Day for World War I and for World War II. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1530.88s)]
*  I think the Russians lost a few more guys than we did. Are we going to parade a submarine into DC? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1535.76s)]
*  Is that what he's saying there? Are you excited for this little North Korea style celebration? [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1540.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, that's the thing. It's easy to chuckle at this because it is his insatiable need for validation [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1544.72s)]
*  requires him to stand and watch missiles being driven in front of him. But there's a serious [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1553.28s)]
*  point to this, which is there's this slow motion frog boiling into fascism that we've been going [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1560.0s)]
*  through for 10 years. And I just don't want to be in a country where the leader sits on a parade [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1565.28s)]
*  stand and watches some missiles go by in front of him. That's what happens in Russia. That's what [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1571.2s)]
*  happens in North Korea. And sure, it happens in some other places that are not as scary as that, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1576.16s)]
*  but that's what this is about. What is more fascistic than a leader on his birthday wanting [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1581.28s)]
*  to see some missiles driven on trucks in front of him? And so it sucks that we have to live [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1588.16s)]
*  in that kind of country. It does suck. I do think a powerful, confident country does not have to [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1594.4s)]
*  parade its missiles. You just kind of know you have them and you pray you never have to use them. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1598.16s)]
*  That's kind of the approach I would prefer. We're going to take a quick break, but Ben, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1601.44s)]

*  far-right lunatic minister, Itamar Ben-Gavir, who proposed permanently blocking all humanitarian [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1792.8s)]
*  supplies to Gaza. Smotrich, when asked about that plan, said, quote, I do not disagree with him [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1797.84s)]
*  morally, but practically the world is not going to allow us to starve to death two million people in [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1803.28s)]
*  Gaza, end quote, absolutely chilling, unequivocally genocidal language right there. This plan will go [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1808.8s)]
*  into effect on May 15th unless Israel and Hamas reach some sort of deal first. That date coincides [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1815.9199999999998s)]
*  with the end of Trump's trip to the Middle East. Next week, I think he's going to Saudi Arabia, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1821.84s)]
*  Qatar, and the UAE. Here are some of the details of Netanyahu's new Gaza plan. So everyone living [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1826.32s)]
*  in Gaza will be displaced and pushed into southern Gaza, the Rafah area, it's about two million [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1833.04s)]
*  people. The IDF will flatten all remaining buildings and destroy Hamas's tunnel network. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1837.12s)]
*  The plan envisions all humanitarian relief being distributed by some new international foundation [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1842.0s)]
*  and by private US companies. I assume we're talking about private US security contractors, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1847.1999999999998s)]
*  but I'm not entirely sure. The United Nations, every international aid organization has already [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1852.56s)]
*  said they will not be a part of this plan. They think it is terrible. And to pull it all off then, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1858.6399999999999s)]
*  Israel will have to mobilize 70,000 reservists, most of whom have already served for close to a [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1864.4s)]
*  year after the October 7th attacks. This Gaza plan from Netanyahu is wildly unpopular, as Axios noted [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1870.0800000000002s)]
*  in their great reporting on all of this. Recent polls show that between 60 to 70% of Israelis [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1877.2800000000002s)]
*  oppose occupying Gaza and a majority want a deal to free the remaining 24 hostages and end the war. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1883.2s)]
*  Ben, I reached out to a friend in Israel just to get a sense from this person of why this is all [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1891.1200000000001s)]
*  happening now. And he said, quote, Trump has given up and lost interest and now BBC is a free hand. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1895.84s)]
*  And that rang pretty true to me, even if Steve Witkoff or others on his team are well-intentioned [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1901.84s)]
*  and really want a deal. It does seem like Trump is like, I don't know, whatever, do what you want now. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1908.48s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean, even Steve Witkoff, this is like far down his punch card, right? I mean, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1912.72s)]
*  he's got the Ukraine negotiations, then he's trying to negotiate a new Iran deal. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1916.96s)]
*  Trump's trip to the Middle East, he'll want something to announce between Iran and maybe [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1921.6s)]
*  some Saudi normalization deal with Israel that tries to cut out the Palestinians or has some [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1927.9199999999998s)]
*  kind of weird language about some future Palestinian state and addressing the humanitarian situation. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1934.56s)]
*  Gaza, clearly, Trump could give a shit about the humanitarian situation in Gaza. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1940.1599999999999s)]
*  And it doesn't seem to be the thing that is getting Steve Witkoff on planes and flying to [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1945.44s)]
*  the region in the same way that even the Iran talks are. And look, I mean, what we're looking at is [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1950.24s)]
*  the kind of slow motion ethnic cleansing of Gaza. They're just moving millions of people [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1956.32s)]
*  back and forth into smaller and smaller enclaves while bombing them and starving them to death [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1963.1200000000001s)]
*  and denying them medicine so that if you're sick or wounded, you will die [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1969.2s)]
*  and then making plans to reoccupy parts of Gaza. And then there's movements to start building [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1973.44s)]
*  probably settlements and they'll say, we have to build settlements in northern Gaza strip as a [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1980.6399999999999s)]
*  buffer or something. But what's happening is the destruction of the Palestinian people [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1985.12s)]
*  in Gaza and just making life so miserable for them that they might someday leave, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=1993.04s)]
*  but nobody wants them. So it's just an absolute calamity in the fact that there's nothing [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2001.04s)]
*  stopping it. The US is obviously not going to stop it. Global condemnation doesn't seem to matter. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2007.52s)]
*  Just kind of points to a totally broken international system. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2015.2s)]
*  Yeah, totally broken. Just another update coming out of the same region. So [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2018.56s)]
*  we've talked a lot about the Houthi rebels in Yemen. Listeners probably remember they've been [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2024.0s)]
*  firing missiles and drones at Israel proper and it ships in the Red Sea in protest of the Israeli [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2027.76s)]
*  military campaign in Gaza. Over the weekend, the Houthis actually managed to get a missile past [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2033.44s)]
*  Israel's missile defense systems and that missile struck near a Ben Gurion international airport in [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2038.8799999999999s)]
*  Tel Aviv. The Israelis responded by destroying Yemen's international airport and by hitting [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2044.32s)]
*  the main port at Hudaydah. However, earlier today, Trump in the Oval Office announced that [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2050.48s)]
*  his team had negotiated some sort of truce with the Houthis. Axios said that Marco Rubio's boss, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2057.2799999999997s)]
*  Steve Witkoff, although if Rubio has four jobs now, Ben, is Witkoff his boss four times over or just [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2062.72s)]
*  at state? I don't think he takes the same interest, Witkoff, in the National Archives position. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2068.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. So maybe that one. Maybe Marco can focus on that. Okay, that's a good call. So regardless, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2072.3999999999996s)]
*  it sounds like Witkoff cut some deal with the Houthis. It was brokered by Oman, but it sounds [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2077.8399999999997s)]
*  like this deal is only, it basically says, we will stop, we, the US, will stop bombing the Houthis [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2082.72s)]
*  and the Houthis in return will stop firing shots or missiles or drones at US ships, but not at [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2089.68s)]
*  Israel. So none of this is confirmed. We'll see if this thing holds. Big picture. It's probably a [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2095.68s)]
*  good thing if Trump, much like Biden before him, figures out that you cannot bomb the Houthis into [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2102.72s)]
*  submission and he instead opted for diplomacy, but it does feel like a bit of a, I'll believe [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2107.84s)]
*  it when I see it hold for several weeks. That's right. I think that Trump, again, is worried [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2113.44s)]
*  about his trip. Like he doesn't want to go over the Middle East and have something going on with [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2118.08s)]
*  the Houthis. That's what he really cares about in terms of his own image. They were worried about [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2121.44s)]
*  how expensive the thing was. I mean, the US was using some pretty expensive hardware in that [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2126.8s)]
*  bombing campaign and not really achieving anything in terms of degrading the Houthis that much, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2133.28s)]
*  certainly not stopping their capacity to launch that kind of attack on Israel. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2139.0400000000004s)]
*  But yeah, I'd rather we stop bombing them. So that's good. But whatever they try to spin here, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2143.1200000000003s)]
*  nothing is different after this bombing campaign than before the bombing campaign. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2150.6400000000003s)]
*  What was that about other than, I don't know, Trump wanting to bomb some people? [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2155.6000000000004s)]
*  And it just shows you the pointlessness of the whole enterprise. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2160.88s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, if the Houthis stop firing missiles at any ships in the Red Sea, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2163.92s)]
*  obviously that would be a win. If they stop firing missiles at Israel, that would be a good thing. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2168.0s)]
*  But I remain skeptical. We'll see if that's the case. Yeah, I remain skeptical that that's going [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2172.4s)]
*  to hold beyond Trump's trip. But we'll see. We'll see. All right, Ben, we had a bunch of elections [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2176.88s)]
*  that we wanted to cover. So we're going to kind of tick through a few of them here. First, we'll [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2182.88s)]
*  start with Australia. Per usual, our friends in Australia bless us with some good news. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2188.0s)]
*  Anthony Albanese from the Labour Party crushed the opposition, the very confusingly named Liberal [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2192.08s)]
*  Party, which is very conservative. So for the purposes of this conversation, just remember, [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2197.04s)]
*  Labour good, Liberal Party bad. The outcome was surprising for a few reasons. First, Albanese [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2201.2s)]
*  badly lost a 2023 referendum about Aboriginal rights, which was seen as a warning sign for [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2208.24s)]
*  his administration and political standing. Then he was trailing in the polls for a long time. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2214.56s)]
*  And then just historically speaking, it's rare for an Australian party in charge to pick up seats [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2218.88s)]
*  going into a second term. So but regardless of all those headwinds, like something clicked for [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2224.48s)]
*  Labour, and they went from holding 78 seats out of 150 in Australia's House of Representatives [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2230.0s)]
*  to holding around 86 seats. They're still counting the votes. We don't know an exact number, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2235.68s)]
*  but it was clearly an improvement. We wanted to reach out to an actual Australian to get his [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2240.08s)]
*  take on what happened. So here is a clip from our friend, Dan Ilic. He's a climate activist. He's [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2246.3199999999997s)]
*  a comedian. He's the host of a podcast. It's called a Rational Fear. It's very funny and excellent. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2251.2s)]
*  Let's listen. Coming into this election, November, December, the Liberals in the coalition were [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2255.68s)]
*  riding high on a sentiment of Donald Trump. And they were looked like they were pretty much going [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2260.88s)]
*  to get in. The polls were not good for Labour. They even were copying Donald Trump's homework. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2265.04s)]
*  They came in with very similar policies. They were going to do a Department of Government [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2271.2s)]
*  Efficiency. They were going to rip up immigration. They were going to destroy the renewable energy [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2275.12s)]
*  transition. The problem when you copy Donald Trump's homework is that he's not the smartest [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2279.2799999999997s)]
*  kid in school. And Australians, we're all compelled to vote. And we are great at smelling [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2285.04s)]
*  bullshitters. And we know when somebody is bullshitting us. Come January, something was [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2291.44s)]
*  happening in America. Something to do with tariffs. And then everybody kind of smelled that. That was [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2295.92s)]
*  terrible. We saw the chaos that the Department of Government Efficiency was causing in America. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2300.2400000000002s)]
*  And we were like, I don't think we want that here. And gradually, the whole of the electorate [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2305.04s)]
*  started to back away slowly from the coalition towards Labour. And we're like, hey, sorry, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2310.0s)]
*  we were looking at that other guy. Maybe there's something with stability that we actually like. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2316.88s)]
*  Maybe there's something about our record low employment and our slowly coming down inflation [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2322.8s)]
*  that is comforting. Australians have gone, oh, you know, we don't want more uncertainty. Thanks. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2327.44s)]
*  I think we'll just kind of stick with what we've got. And this government, the Labour Government, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2332.7200000000003s)]
*  are very good at not doing much. They are very astute governors when it comes to doing things [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2336.96s)]
*  very slowly over a long period of time. And I think given our electoral cycles, only three years, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2343.36s)]
*  I think Australians want to see what else this Labour Government has got. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2349.2000000000003s)]
*  Great, great summary there from Dan. I was listening to a bunch of Australian podcasts, Ben, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2352.88s)]
*  where I heard a bunch of analysts talk about how this wasn't, we don't want to make this about [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2358.48s)]
*  ourselves, about America. This was not the Canadian election where, you know, voters were responding [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2362.48s)]
*  to Trump trying to annex them. But it does sound like there was a sense that Australians kind of [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2367.28s)]
*  looked at our politics and looked at some of the things that Peter Dutton was saying. And they were [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2372.64s)]
*  like, you know what? This brand and vibe sucks. And we just like, we don't want that. And by the way, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2376.3199999999997s)]
*  like in Canada, Peter Dutton, the right wing Liberal Party opposition leader, lost his own seat, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2382.16s)]
*  a seat he had held since 2001. So a great outcome. What were your big takeaways from this? [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2388.24s)]
*  Tommy, I just want to point out, we don't do a lot of like, you know, victory laps on this podcast [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2395.04s)]
*  about, I mean, the most important victory lap is for the Australian people, which Dan did. But like, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2401.44s)]
*  we've been talking about this potential Trump effect for weeks now. So it's always nice to see [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2405.84s)]
*  like the news analysis piece pop up in the feed. That's what we were talking about a few weeks ago. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2410.64s)]
*  But there's really two things that jump out to me that do connect to us. But obviously, this is [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2417.2000000000003s)]
*  above all about Australians. But these things are not inconsistent. One is, yeah, Trump is a really [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2423.52s)]
*  unstable guy. Tariffs are destabilizing global economy, there's weird shit going on. And that [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2429.36s)]
*  kind of helps a competent incumbent, you know. And that's what the Australians have. But the second [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2434.48s)]
*  and more interesting thing that you and Dan talked about, but that really bears kind of emphasis, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2440.7200000000003s)]
*  is it's not just who can stand up to Trump or who can deal with uncertainty. It's that Trump is [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2445.44s)]
*  discrediting a whole brand of politics in the kind of advanced economies of the world, [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2451.68s)]
*  that these guys like Dutton and Polly even Canada, kind of looked Trump lightish, and people don't [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2458.7999999999997s)]
*  want that. They're seeing, you know, shit, if we take a risk on that, maybe you would feel good. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2466.24s)]
*  Maybe I don't like these technocratic labor guys. But you know what, if I vote for this right wing [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2471.2s)]
*  guy, because it might feel good to punish these people, I might end up with outcomes like what [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2477.12s)]
*  the Americans are going through. And I think that is a kind of intangible part of global politics [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2481.92s)]
*  now. And this Dutton guy was a fucking right wing asshole. This wasn't just kind of some center [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2489.2s)]
*  right guy. After the Australian liberals lost the last election, they kind of had that same kind of [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2495.2s)]
*  debate about the direction of the right wing party that the Republicans had in 2012. Should we [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2502.56s)]
*  tack to the center or should we go further to the right? And they went much further to the right. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2509.2799999999997s)]
*  And it is very good for Australians and for the world that that guy not only lost the national [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2512.7999999999997s)]
*  election, but he lost his seat, because people start to need to get the message that we don't [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2517.36s)]
*  want this. Yeah. And I think Australians are traditionally a little more centrist than even [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2521.12s)]
*  we are probably. Ben, last thing on this. The AP had a story about how after voting on Saturday, [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2524.96s)]
*  many Australians had what they call a democracy sausage. Have you heard about this? [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2531.84s)]
*  No, but I saw some great, some Australian world, those were sending me some great pics of like [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2536.6400000000003s)]
*  Australians like voting in their bathing suits and stuff. Yeah, I saw that too. So the democracy [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2539.92s)]
*  sausage, insert Bill Clinton joke here. According to the AP, it is a grilled sausage wrapped in a [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2544.48s)]
*  slice of white bread topped with onion and ketchup. I guess democracy sausage vendors camp out at [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2551.04s)]
*  polling places and sell these things like everywhere, including at polling places for [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2556.8s)]
*  citizens abroad. This apparently began like as bake sales in the 1920s. It evolved into the [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2562.1600000000003s)]
*  democracy sausage iteration in the 1980s as people had access to portable barbecue grills, [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2568.96s)]
*  but voting is required by law. So it happens on a Saturday in Australia, which makes total sense. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2575.1200000000003s)]
*  It's a family affair. People bring their kids, the dog, whatever, and it'll be at like some local [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2579.84s)]
*  high school and there'll be someone with a barbecue hawking a bunch of sausages out front. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2584.4s)]
*  I tweeted like, is this a real thing or is this a dumb thing that Americans talk about [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2588.64s)]
*  because it sounds funny? And a bunch of Australians replied to me that like, oh no, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2592.4s)]
*  democracy sausage is the real deal. And so maybe next election we should go and snag one. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2596.0s)]
*  It literally sounds what Bandit, the dad in Bluey would do on election day is just like stand outside [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2600.7200000000003s)]
*  flipping a bunch of democracy sausages. So I'm fully on board with this. I kind of, one of the, [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2607.36s)]
*  I keep in mind different quintessential worldos out there, like an Australian progressive eating a [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2613.12s)]
*  democracy sausage and voting to kind of kill the far right in Australia is like kind of our, [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2618.8s)]
*  right in the, like the core of our listenership. So congratulations to everybody. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2624.56s)]
*  Yeah, those are the best. All right, Ben. So now I'm going to try to lump together a couple of [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2629.2s)]
*  races that didn't go quite as well. First, there was a parliamentary election by election in the [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2632.56s)]
*  UK and in the US we'd call it a special election. It was for a seat that was vacated by a labor [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2638.0s)]
*  party member who I believe punched a constituent. I remember reading this listeners correct me if [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2643.92s)]
*  I'm wrong, but this dude assaulted a constituent. So they had to buy election Nigel Farage's far [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2648.72s)]
*  right reform party won that seat by six votes over a labor candidate, literally six votes. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2653.6s)]
*  And reform also did extremely well on a bunch of local elections, crushing the Tory party in a lot [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2660.0s)]
*  of cases. So that is ominous for the trajectory of politics in the UK generally, but also for [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2664.72s)]
*  Keir Starmer and the UK labor party. And then things got pretty Trumpy in Romania. George [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2670.3199999999997s)]
*  Simeon is a Euro skeptic, 38 year old big Trump fan. He won about 40% of the vote and is expected [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2677.2s)]
*  to win the runoff election on May 18th. Last year listeners probably remember this far right weirdo [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2684.3999999999996s)]
*  named Colleen Georgescu came out of nowhere to win the first round of the presidential election. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2690.56s)]
*  But then Romania's constitutional court annulled the result because of alleged Russian interference. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2695.92s)]
*  And then they banned him from running again. So in this election Simeon actually cast his ballot [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2700.96s)]
*  with Georgescu I think together in solidarity. Fun facts about Simeon. He's banned from Ukraine [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2706.4s)]
*  and Moldova. Cool. His comms director used to work for Andrew Tate. Very fun. He's against military [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2712.48s)]
*  aid for Ukraine. He's anti-vax. He wants to buddy up with Georgia Maloney once he takes power. Also [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2718.32s)]
*  this little tidbit from the Wall Street Journal jumped out at us. Quote, to bolster his nationalist [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2724.1600000000003s)]
*  message he has used stage actors to impersonate people from Romania's medieval past including [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2729.6800000000003s)]
*  Vlad the Impaler, the historical figure who was the basis for the character Dracula, which is [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2734.2400000000002s)]
*  actually pretty badass. Romania's president has a lot of sway over military matters and foreign [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2739.28s)]
*  policy. So this could have pretty big implications for the EU and NATO. In the interim Romania's [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2743.76s)]
*  prime minister has resigned because his party got smoked. So some pretty big changes in Romania. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2750.0800000000004s)]
*  Ben, thoughts on this kind of cacophony of voting we just talked about? Yeah, I mean the Romanian [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2755.1200000000003s)]
*  piece is alarming but it's been feeling like it's been building in that direction for some time. But [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2761.0400000000004s)]
*  I mean what you don't want to see, you know, we've already seen in places like Hungary and Slovakia [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2765.84s)]
*  like, you know, is the kind of contagion of the normalization of far-right people actually, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2770.72s)]
*  you know, not just being protest votes but winning, you know. And we saw this in Austria [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2777.2s)]
*  too, right? So the big European countries like Germany and France have, you know, they've been [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2783.4399999999996s)]
*  kind of beating back this trend but you're just starting to see like these small countries really [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2788.08s)]
*  matter because one, they can gum up the works in European institutions. Two, they can kind of, [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2792.56s)]
*  again, normalize this as a successful form of politics but also to take to the UK. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2798.48s)]
*  Yes, we in this podcast, we want left parties to win or center left parties to win. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2806.16s)]
*  Like it's kind of scary to me that reform is overtaking Tories, right? I would rather there [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2811.44s)]
*  be like, you know, center-right parties that I don't disagree with that are not fucking crazy [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2817.2s)]
*  that can hold the line. I would rather like a Mertz in Germany is the, you know, the CDU, [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2822.1600000000003s)]
*  you know, center-right party chancellor than the AFD, the fucking Nazis, right? And that's what's [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2828.1600000000003s)]
*  scary to me about reform is that if they can become the right-wing alternative to labor, [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2834.48s)]
*  their chance of actually winning and then, you know, having a, you know, MAGA, whatever version [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2840.1600000000003s)]
*  agenda of that in the UK is that much higher. Yeah, and we're going to get to Germany in one [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2845.28s)]
*  second. Lastly, on the elections, Ben, Singapore had an election, the ruling People's Action Party [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2850.0s)]
*  wanted a landslide further tightening their grip on power. Any thoughts from there on what just [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2855.68s)]
*  happened? And please don't get changed with your comments. No, I've been here. I mean, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2860.72s)]
*  people did think that this was genuinely a good result for the ruling party, in part because it [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2866.32s)]
*  upped the vote share from the last election, right? So the vote share went up. And frankly, [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2873.76s)]
*  when you talk to people here, like what you hear is that the Trump effect really did matter [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2877.6s)]
*  because Singapore's economy, and I think this is quite interesting, Singapore's economy is really [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2882.4s)]
*  dependent on globalization, right? And so tariffs are a big danger. Instability is a big danger. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2888.0s)]
*  And there was a sense that like, hey, the ruling party, obviously, these guys have been around, [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2894.24s)]
*  you know, forever, essentially, since the founding of the country, but they are kind of competent [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2898.16s)]
*  hands that can guide us through like the stormy period. So the Workers' Party opposition, you know, [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2903.12s)]
*  didn't make the inroads that they might have thought they would have made, say, six months ago. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2908.16s)]
*  I will note, Tommy, that the campaigning period in Singapore, I learned while I was here, is nine [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2912.88s)]
*  days. So it is not... Canada was 37. I was like, dude, that's incredible. Well, I said, you know, [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2919.2799999999997s)]
*  somewhere between the two year cycles we have in the US and nine days is a much more rational, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2926.24s)]
*  yeah, let's probably closer to nine, like a three month period. So I will say that. But this was [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2930.56s)]
*  definitely a vote for kind of stability and familiar leadership here. God, shorter elections [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2935.44s)]
*  sounds so good. All right, Ben, so two stories out of Germany that we wanted to mention. The first is [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2940.72s)]
*  that earlier this morning, Friedrich Merz, the leader of Germany's center right Christian Democratic [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2944.56s)]
*  Union or CDU party suffered a shocking historic defeat in the Bundestag of the Germany's [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2948.88s)]
*  parliament. Remember, in February, the CDU won the most seats in Germany's federal election. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2954.96s)]
*  Merz and the CDU entered into these coalition talks with the Social Democratic Party or SPD. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2959.92s)]
*  They announced a coalition agreement in early May. And so this vote today was supposed to be [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2965.04s)]
*  like a formality. Merz just needed a majority of the Bundestag representatives to vote for him to [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2969.84s)]
*  be chancellor. And the combined CDU SPD coalition currently controls like 328 seats. So it seems [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2975.28s)]
*  like a foregone conclusion. But when the first round was tallied, Merz only got 310 votes, [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2982.48s)]
*  which is six short of the 316 he needed. And this just shocked everybody. It shocked Merz, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2988.24s)]
*  it shocked the media, it shocked foreign diplomats. Angela Merkel was like in the chamber watching it [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2993.3599999999997s)]
*  all go down. I think there was a party scheduled for afterwards. And it was a secret ballot. So [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=2999.04s)]
*  we don't really know what happened or who voted what way. I reached out to a Bundestag member who [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3004.16s)]
*  was part of this government coalition. And this person said that it was actually that they believe [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3011.6s)]
*  it was Merz's own party, members of his own party making life hard for him. People who were pissed [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3017.36s)]
*  like they didn't get a job, or that wanted to send a warning to Merz for some reason, they just [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3022.56s)]
*  decided to vote against him. But for a few hours this morning, the world was left wondering if this [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3027.6800000000003s)]
*  new stable seeming German government was about to collapse on itself before it got started. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3033.6800000000003s)]
*  And Germany could have been forced to have new elections. And that likely would have seen [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3039.44s)]
*  the far right AFD party do even better and improve its margins. So luckily that didn't happen. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3043.6s)]
*  The Bundestag scheduled a second vote. Merz is now chancellor. He got 325 votes. But man, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3049.12s)]
*  pretty surprising then that Merz's own party would want to hobble and humiliate him before he takes [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3054.88s)]
*  power. And it really makes you wonder about the quality of his political operation if they didn't [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3061.36s)]
*  see this coming. Yeah. I'm not a Merz stan, right? I'm more of a social democratic [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3066.4s)]
*  flavor in German politics. But we need Merz to succeed in some respects. Yeah, absolutely. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3073.36s)]
*  We need him to beat back the far right AFD. We need him to help figure out how to stand up to [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3082.1600000000003s)]
*  Putin and be a part of the solution in supporting Ukraine. And this is just not good. Beginning your [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3088.6400000000003s)]
*  tenure with a kind of unprecedented failure to kind of go through the ceremonial victory procedure [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3096.1600000000003s)]
*  is not a good sign about your capacity. To your point, this is parliamentary democracy. It's akin [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3103.2799999999997s)]
*  to not whipping votes in the US Congress and not knowing that you've got a problem on the horizon. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3109.68s)]
*  So it is a question about his political operation. But also the AFD has been raising a lot of noise, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3114.72s)]
*  by the way, helped out by people like Marco fucking Rubio. Basically, the AFD is bitching about being [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3121.52s)]
*  treated as a non-mainstream party. And this will help play into their narrative, I think, [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3127.8399999999997s)]
*  that there's something fishy in German politics, that they're excluded and maybe that's why Merz [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3134.7999999999997s)]
*  couldn't get votes. So it also worries me that it kind of plays into the AFD narrative about [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3140.72s)]
*  something being wrong with German politics. Yeah. So on this AFD narrative, so last week, [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3145.7599999999998s)]
*  Germany's domestic intelligence agency designated the AFD as, quote, an extremist endeavor, [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3150.72s)]
*  which makes it easier for German intelligence to conduct surveillance on the AFD and presumably [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3156.72s)]
*  its members. Previously, the AFD had been designated by German intelligence as a suspected [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3161.9199999999996s)]
*  extremist group. The intelligence agency that announced this decision, it's called the Office [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3167.6s)]
*  for the Protection of the Constitution. It's a very cool name for an intelligence agency. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3172.08s)]
*  They said they did a three-year review of the AFD party and that, quote, the AFD's ethnic and [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3175.9199999999996s)]
*  dissent-based understanding of the people, which devalues the entire population groups in Germany [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3181.3599999999997s)]
*  and violates their human dignity. That was a key driver of their decision along with their [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3186.0s)]
*  anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim views. So the AFD is the second largest political party in Germany [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3189.84s)]
*  right now. This ruling could restart a debate about whether the AFD should be banned, though [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3194.88s)]
*  that process would take years. The designation, though, as you mentioned, Ben, of the AFD by [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3200.48s)]
*  this intelligence agency in Germany, it seemed to enrage the Trump administration. Marco Rubio [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3205.36s)]
*  called it tyranny in disguise. JD Vance tweeted something and got very mad online. I thought [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3210.16s)]
*  the German foreign ministry was tweeting back at Rubio saying, this is democracy. We have learned [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3215.92s)]
*  from our history that right-wing extremism needs to be stopped. So Ben, I don't know. I feel torn [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3221.04s)]
*  on this one. On some level, if German intelligence thinks that the AFD is full of dangerous extremists, [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3225.84s)]
*  they should obviously say as much. There is obviously a very dark history here that they're [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3231.6s)]
*  trying to avoid repeating, but that history includes spying on German citizens, and that part [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3236.88s)]
*  makes me uncomfortable too. Banning the AFD entirely, I think, seems likely to just backlash [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3244.24s)]
*  spectacularly, and you'll see people migrate to some new party that is also extremists. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3250.3999999999996s)]
*  I think you have to beat these people at the ballot box. But what did you make of this [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3255.2s)]
*  move within Germany and then the Trump world's completely over-the-top seeming response? [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3259.3599999999997s)]
*  I think that I'm more sympathetic to what the German government is doing here [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3266.0s)]
*  than I even probably would have been a few months ago because of what we're living through. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3272.88s)]
*  January 5th, 2021. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3277.44s)]
*  Well, yeah. In part though, Tommy, as an effort to understand the worst versions of where things [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3278.72s)]
*  can go, I've been reading a lot about how the Nazi party came into power. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3286.4s)]
*  Me too. What are you reading? [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3289.92s)]
*  I just finished a book called The Meaning of Hitler, which is essentially by Sebastian [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3291.68s)]
*  Hafner, which is to try to understand him. Sebastian Hafner also wrote a great book called [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3298.24s)]
*  Defying Hitler. It was contemporaneous and it was about being an individual and watching the [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3301.2s)]
*  country getting taken over. I read The Rise of the Third Reich, which is about how did Hitler [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3305.8399999999997s)]
*  come to power. That's the mother tome, right? I'm reading The Wages of Destruction, which is [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3310.72s)]
*  the making and breaking of the Nazi economy. It's from 2008 to Adam Tooze, who's an economist [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3316.3199999999997s)]
*  that gets into all the economic forces that led to the rise of the Nazi party. It's really [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3320.96s)]
*  interesting because it really just narrows in on not just the inflation piece of it, but all [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3325.52s)]
*  the underpinnings of the Nazi ideology and how it allowed for such extremism. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3331.68s)]
*  Well, and it was a convergence of some familiar things. It was a mixture of a very extreme [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3336.2400000000002s)]
*  ideology with deep, deep anti-Semitism as a part of it and a stab in the back narrative about World [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3343.12s)]
*  War I. But also the familiarity is, hey, there's high inflation, people are angry, they're moving [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3348.56s)]
*  to the extreme right or the extreme left, there's polarization, there's a capitulation by institutions [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3354.72s)]
*  and by industrialists to the Nazis. Point being, and the reason this is relevant is it should be [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3361.12s)]
*  the case that fucking Germany has some pretty extreme guardrails against the far right coming [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3366.72s)]
*  back to power. That should happen. I support that in a way that I probably wouldn't think it was the [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3372.16s)]
*  right thing in another country that doesn't have that history. They should go the extra mile to [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3378.08s)]
*  keep these people out. And the reality is some of these people are extremists in the AFD. There was [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3383.44s)]
*  like a coup attempt in Germany, remember? That was foiled just a matter of years ago. And I'm not [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3388.4s)]
*  saying that's everybody in the AFD, but those people are in the AFD. And if they're seeing that, [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3393.68s)]
*  they should fucking deal with it. And we should start to take this as a threat that it is. This [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3397.92s)]
*  is not about people I disagree with on policy, winning elections in certain countries. It's [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3402.48s)]
*  about literal Nazi descendants. And I don't mean ethnically descendants, but ideological [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3407.68s)]
*  descendants of Nazism in places like Germany. And the fact that the US government that does not [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3413.9199999999996s)]
*  comment on... Marco Rubio does not comment on small D democratic issues in a lot of places. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3418.96s)]
*  All the oppressed people around the world, obviously Gaza is the most extreme instance of [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3426.8799999999997s)]
*  this. There are people being repressed in many different countries around the world. And the [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3431.3599999999997s)]
*  fact that they choose to speak out about the ethno-nationalist far right and fucking Germany [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3434.7999999999997s)]
*  is terrifying to me. And Americans should be furious about this. People's grandparents [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3440.48s)]
*  fought the fucking Nazis on the fucking beaches. And we now have people, Secretary of State and [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3446.3199999999997s)]
*  Vice President of the United States, who are trying to defend them in Germany. What is going [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3452.0s)]
*  on here, people? Sorry to rant there a little bit, but how could this not... And one more thing, [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3457.12s)]
*  we hear about anti-Semitism all the time. Some college kid chants, like, river to the sea, [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3463.44s)]
*  and we're going to deport people in this country. These are the anti-Semites that you need to worry [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3468.96s)]
*  about, the far right people. Some scary ones. Do you think there was a German, Salina Zito, [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3474.32s)]
*  in 1932, saying we should take Hitler seriously, but not literally? Talking about all the angry, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3478.7200000000003s)]
*  economically disadvantaged Bavarian farmers or something? The Bavarians are mad about the [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3487.2000000000003s)]
*  price of eggs. And guess what? The Bavarians were mad about the price of eggs, but it doesn't mean [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3491.44s)]
*  that that was okay. Yeah, because they were wheel bearing around cash to try to pay for them. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3496.16s)]
*  We're going to watch this one. It is very weird, like, JD Vance, Marco Rubio, these guys are [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3501.6s)]
*  primarily animated by this defense of the AFD, which, again, we talked about the AFD a bunch [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3506.48s)]
*  on the show. But Marine Le Pen, the far right in France, thought the AFD was too extreme. This is [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3512.64s)]
*  not an edge case. This is not like CPAC. These are scary, nasty people. This is not Pierre Polyaev [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3519.52s)]
*  or Peter Dunn in Australia. These are the extreme right people in Germany. All right. Ben, two more [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3524.4s)]
*  quick things. Last week, we covered the terror attack in India controlled Kashmir and how it [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3529.6000000000004s)]
*  has dramatically ratcheted up tensions between India and Pakistan. If you want to go deeper on [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3533.84s)]
*  that topic, check out last week's show. But shortly before we started recording, India's [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3537.6000000000004s)]
*  armed forces released a statement saying they had launched a military response to this terror attack. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3542.48s)]
*  This is from the Indian government statement, quote, A little while ago, the Indian armed [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3546.96s)]
*  forces launched Operation Sindor, hitting terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan occupied [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3551.04s)]
*  Jammu and Kashmir from where terrorist attacks against India have been planned and directed. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3556.0s)]
*  Altogether, nine sites have been targeted. The statement says no Pakistani military facilities [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3560.8s)]
*  were targeted and that, quote, India has demonstrated considerable restraint in the selection of targets [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3565.44s)]
*  and method of execution. Hard to confirm if that's true with the limited information we have available. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3570.96s)]
*  A military spokesman in Pakistan said, quote, Pakistan will respond to this at a time and place [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3576.4s)]
*  of its own choosing. This heinous provocation will not go unanswered. So now I guess we all sit and [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3582.32s)]
*  kind of wait. Hopefully the escalation here will be measured in adjectives in press statements and [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3588.1600000000003s)]
*  not volume of ballistic missile strikes, but serious stuff, one to watch top of the list of [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3595.04s)]
*  World War III watch at the moment. Yeah, surging to the top of the list. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3602.48s)]
*  I would note that the Indians in their statement kind of said, justice is served. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3606.7200000000003s)]
*  They were trying to close the books. They're trying to close the books. We got attacked, [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3615.12s)]
*  now we just bombed a bunch of stuff and it's over. Now the ball is in Pakistan's court, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3618.96s)]
*  unfortunately, in the sense that if they do something in response, so you just have to [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3624.96s)]
*  manage this risk of escalation. You just have to hope that, reasons so dangerous, [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3629.92s)]
*  if one thing goes wrong, if one target ends up being something that is more consequential than [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3635.76s)]
*  is intended, if a plane is shot down, this could ratchet up in their nuclear arm powers. So this is [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3642.48s)]
*  not a surprise, but it needs to be managed. And I just don't think there are many external forces [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3649.52s)]
*  that are kind of doing enough to urge de-escalation. I mean, that's I'm sure [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3655.68s)]
*  whatever he's saying, but it's really up to the Indians and Pakistanis to just climb down from [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3660.0s)]
*  this precipice. Yeah, and as we talked about at the top, diplomatic work like this requires effort [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3664.56s)]
*  and creativity and a lot of thought and a staff that's capable of executing. And I just don't [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3670.56s)]
*  know that Trump has that right now. You mentioned on last week's show that in a previous instance of [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3676.0s)]
*  the escalation between India and Pakistan, there are times when the Pakistanis will fire a missile [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3680.4s)]
*  at nothing into the woods and be like, yeah, we killed a bunch of Indian troops. Hopefully, [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3685.28s)]
*  that's the outcome here and we all can just chill out, but we'll see. And then finally, Ben, [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3689.2000000000003s)]
*  the Papal Conclave is going to start on Wednesday, May 7th. So the day this episode comes out, [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3694.4s)]
*  I'm not Catholic, you're not Catholic. I don't know shit about the church. I don't know shit [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3700.7200000000003s)]
*  about most of the cardinals who are running to be the next pope, but people are betting on it. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3704.0800000000004s)]
*  So here's what the smart money is telling us. So Polymarket has odds for the top four candidates [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3708.1600000000003s)]
*  as of this recording. So Pietro Parolin is our leader. He's got 26% likelihood of becoming pope. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3714.3199999999997s)]
*  He is seen as a compromise candidate and is the current Vatican Secretary of State. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3719.44s)]
*  That's my dog. That's my guy that I met with when I went to normalize relations with the US and Cuba. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3724.08s)]
*  I spent a couple of hours with that guy. Great guy. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3730.0s)]
*  So the New York Times called him a quiet, plotting Italian who was deeply cautious. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3733.2799999999997s)]
*  Does that jive with your experience? Sounds like a good time. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3737.44s)]
*  Yeah, maybe that's what he was doing. I mean, actually the funny thing, Tommy, is that we went [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3740.24s)]
*  and the Cubans met with him first. He was the Secretary of State of the Vatican, right? So [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3745.7599999999998s)]
*  essentially they're a foreign minister type. And so they know they're hosting the meeting, [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3749.2799999999997s)]
*  but they don't know how much progress we and the Cubans have made. And the Cubans go in first [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3753.52s)]
*  because he wants to meet one at a time with us before meeting together. And when the Cubans [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3758.64s)]
*  come out and we go in, he's kind of shocked because we're going to normalize relations. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3763.84s)]
*  Because it's like a real deal. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3768.6400000000003s)]
*  So he said, yeah. And he's like, are you really like, your guys are normalizing relations? [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3769.36s)]
*  Like he had to confirm it with me that this was really happening. I was like, yeah. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3773.76s)]
*  And he kind of goes through the list of things where we exchanged prisoners. And he looks at me [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3777.52s)]
*  and he goes, who are you? And then he goes, does John Kerry know about this? He's like, [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3780.88s)]
*  who are you young man? [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3787.76s)]
*  Et cetera. It's me. It's Ben. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3788.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, that's a great story. Well, maybe he goes, you could do you a favor, you know, [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3790.8s)]
*  send you some some specially blessed holy water or something. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3795.36s)]
*  You can get that at the Vatican, by the way. You can get some some holy water. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3800.32s)]
*  We'll talk to some business opportunities. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3802.96s)]
*  OK, so we got Luis Antonio Tagle at 22 percent. He's from the Philippines. He'd be the first [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3804.2400000000002s)]
*  Asian pope. He's viewed as liberal for a cardinal, kind of more in the Pope Francis mold. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3809.92s)]
*  Time calls him a cardinal influencer with an active presence and dedicated following on [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3815.28s)]
*  social media. So question has been, can he bypass the MSM gatekeepers and tick tock his [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3820.16s)]
*  way into eternity? I think we're going to find out. Then we got Mateo Zuppi at 10 percent odds, [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3825.7599999999998s)]
*  seen as a continuity candidate, the Italian progressive is known for his work with the poor [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3831.92s)]
*  and with migrants. He's also the Vatican's envoy for Ukraine. Sky News referred to him as a street [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3836.64s)]
*  priest, which I'm going to choose to believe means he's first in line for every supreme drop. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3842.64s)]
*  But we'll see. And then we got Pierre Battista Pizzaballa, which is amazing. 10 percent. Great [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3847.6s)]
*  names. Great names. So Pizzaballa's service is in Israel, the Palestinian territories, Jordan, [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3854.24s)]
*  Cyprus. His time away from the Middle East and from the Vatican in his relative youth seems to [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3860.24s)]
*  have diminished his chances, but he's fluent in Hebrew, which is pretty cool. He's got by far the [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3867.2s)]
*  best name of all the dudes we've mentioned. But are Catholics ready to elect a Jewish priest? [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3871.44s)]
*  We don't know. Actually, he's not Jewish. I'm just kidding. But it's cool that he speaks Hebrew. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3875.76s)]
*  It's cool that he's living in Israel. It actually seems like maybe there'll be some continuity there [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3879.44s)]
*  of giving a shit about Gaza. That'd be great. So Ben, per The Economist, Roman banking houses [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3884.2400000000002s)]
*  were taking bets on the popes as far back as 1503. The Vatican, as the conclave starts, [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3889.0400000000004s)]
*  will reportedly cut off phone signals in the Vatican City. They'll use signal jammers around [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3896.5600000000004s)]
*  the Sistine Chapel to prevent the news from leaking. The last two conclaves lasted about two [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3900.56s)]
*  days. Are you going to put some money on this bad boy? I guess I'm going to go with my guy, [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3906.0s)]
*  Cardinal Perrine, just because he's the only one I would have been in the same room with. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3911.2s)]
*  I will say, Tom, you know what's funny to me? There's that running joke on Twitter that [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3916.64s)]
*  everybody's, something will happen and everybody's a pandemic expert. And this one, because a bunch [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3921.6s)]
*  of people saw the movie Conclave. I know. They think they really know the inner workings of [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3927.28s)]
*  the Vatican. And I would just say, that's a little context and color, but we don't know what's going [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3932.7200000000003s)]
*  on inside the freaking conclave here. God only knows. Just in terms of the process. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3942.0s)]
*  You're right, actually. God only knows. 135 cardinals are eligible to vote. As we mentioned [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3946.8s)]
*  after Pope Francis died, Francis elevated 108 of them. So 80% of the vote will be from cardinals [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3952.08s)]
*  who owe their jobs to Pope Francis, which makes me hopeful that we might get some sort of continuity [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3959.84s)]
*  with him. Yeah, a little progressive pope. We want to keep the tradition of the progressive pope. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3965.04s)]
*  Yeah, that would be good. 22 were selected by Benedict, five by John Paul II. Again, [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3969.36s)]
*  cardinals under 80 years old get the vote. There's one vote on the first day, then there's up to four [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3975.52s)]
*  votes every day after. You need a two-thirds majority to elect the new pope and see that [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3980.48s)]
*  sweet, sweet white smoke. So time will tell. Yeah, we'll see. Wrapped attention. Okay, [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3985.28s)]
*  we're going to take a quick break. When we come back, you're going to hear Ben's interview with [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3990.64s)]
*  Clayton Weimers about the state of press freedom, both in the US and around the world. So stick [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=3992.96s)]

*  for joining us. Thanks so much for having me. So we wanted to have you on to spotlight, obviously, [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4146.32s)]
*  the grim picture for press freedom globally. It was recently World Press Freedom Day, and [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4152.32s)]
*  Reporters Without Borders, which is a great organization in the US, is part of the broader [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4160.16s)]
*  family of organizations to protect press freedom around the world. You released your annual World [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4165.759999999999s)]
*  Press Freedom Index, and probably not surprising to people. It's not a banner year for press [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4172.0s)]
*  freedom around the world. But I want to go through some of the factors with you about what is [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4178.88s)]
*  happening here in the United States and globally. But first, I just want to ask you, what is your [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4183.84s)]
*  takeaway about kind of the top line from this report? You described the global state of press [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4189.6s)]
*  freedom as difficult. I think that's probably an intended understatement to some extent. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4195.36s)]
*  But what do you look at in terms of what the index shows about the trend line globally for [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4202.639999999999s)]
*  press freedom? Yeah, in a word, the trend is bad. Press freedom has been trending downward for a [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4207.599999999999s)]
*  number of years. In the 2025 index, which we just released, we hit a new low point. People might be [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4214.4s)]
*  familiar with the color coded map that we use where bad countries are red, good countries are [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4221.92s)]
*  green. The global average of all the countries press freedom scores has gone into the orange [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4226.96s)]
*  zone for the first time. That's that difficult indicator that you mentioned. And so that's a [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4232.24s)]
*  first for as long as we've been measuring press freedom. We've been doing the index since 2002. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4240.08s)]
*  And we're seeing a decline on all the indicators that we measure. But the one that seems to be [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4246.4s)]
*  driving the biggest pullback here is the economic indicator that we measure. And that's because [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4251.68s)]
*  we've seen the marketplace for the news media kind of crumbling all around the world as advertising [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4261.4400000000005s)]
*  revenue shifts more towards the tech giants instead of the news media. But we're also seeing [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4267.280000000001s)]
*  governments turn increasingly towards economic pressure as a means of controlling the press. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4273.68s)]
*  So we still see a lot of assassinations and arrests of journalists all over the world. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4279.44s)]
*  But the more sophisticated, if you will, regimes are turning to economic pressure as their preferred [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4284.0s)]
*  tool for controlling the narrative. Yeah, I thought this was really interesting. And probably, [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4289.92s)]
*  to people that don't follow this issue closely, maybe the most interesting part of the report, [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4298.08s)]
*  because people are familiar with the threats from Trump about fake news. And we'll talk globally [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4303.68s)]
*  about obviously some of the more extreme violence and risks that journals face. But just to focus [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4310.08s)]
*  on the US for starters, how do you assess the state of press freedom in the US? You have us [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4315.04s)]
*  clocking in at 57th out of 180 countries, which is not exactly near the top of the rankings. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4322.88s)]
*  The trend line has been going negative. But on this balance between economic impacts, [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4330.4800000000005s)]
*  you know, the kind of death of local journalism, the kind of vacuuming up of media space by social [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4336.56s)]
*  media platforms that kind of don't compensate the journalists who produce the original source [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4342.72s)]
*  material. How do you balance that as the difficulty versus, you know, Trump targeting [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4348.48s)]
*  specific media organizations or cutting off funding for VOA or Radio Free Europe? You know, [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4360.24s)]
*  how much is a Trump effect? How much is kind of the structural economic piece? Or are those [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4366.24s)]
*  connected, as you just indicated at the end of your last answer? Is Trump kind of coming in behind [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4371.12s)]
*  some of the already difficult economic circumstances for news media? [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4376.4s)]
*  They're definitely connected. I think Trump understands this idea of using economic pressure [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4380.639999999999s)]
*  pretty well. You look at some of the media companies that he's singled out or targeted. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4385.679999999999s)]
*  He's targeted CBS, which is owned by Paramount. And Paramount is trying to undergo a pretty [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4391.679999999999s)]
*  complicated merger right now that the US government has a lot of power to slow down or halt altogether. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4397.679999999999s)]
*  And Paramount has made it pretty clear that they would rather make a deal with Trump [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4404.8s)]
*  over his, you know, 60 minutes complaints, you know, stemming back to an interview that he [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4409.2s)]
*  alleges they doctored with Kamala Harris. They would rather make a deal with the Trump administration [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4414.72s)]
*  in order to facilitate their other business transactions than go to war over the First [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4419.84s)]
*  Amendment and the rights of the reporters who work at 60 minutes. There's been a similar deal [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4425.04s)]
*  discussed with Disney, which would rather, you know, not be in the president's crosshairs [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4430.8s)]
*  if they can avoid it. But that comes at the expense of the reporters doing journalism and ABC News. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4436.24s)]
*  And, you know, obviously Trump understands that he can put these companies into a bind here where [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4442.72s)]
*  they have to make a decision between the much more lucrative parts of their company that are making [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4448.320000000001s)]
*  them a ton of money and the news media part of their company, which, let's face it, is not making [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4452.72s)]
*  a ton of money. And that's the other big factor here, which is that for the past decade, we've [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4458.4s)]
*  seen massive layoffs in the media industry, thousands of journalism jobs just gone every year. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4464.0s)]
*  There's an estimate that every week two local newspapers in this country close and they're not [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4471.04s)]
*  being replaced. And now add on top of that the added economic pressure that's also political [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4476.16s)]
*  pressure from the Trump administration when he does things like threaten the funding of public [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4483.44s)]
*  media. He wants to cut off all the media, all the funding that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4487.84s)]
*  gives to NPR and PBS. But at the end of the day, what the effect that that has is it cuts off the [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4495.4400000000005s)]
*  funding for the local independent affiliates all around the country. And it's disproportionately [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4501.12s)]
*  going to harm the media outlets that are serving rural communities, places that are already at [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4506.56s)]
*  risk of becoming news deserts or may already be news deserts. And so the impact is really [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4512.72s)]
*  going to be felt on the ground. It's not going to have a primary impact on the DC offices of NPR. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4517.52s)]
*  Yeah. We try to talk about the authoritarian playbook around the world on this podcast. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4525.52s)]
*  And this is familiar to me in terms of leaders weaponizing revenue to further accelerate the [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4532.64s)]
*  collapse of media or using other tools to kind of try to punish or compel positive coverage. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4542.48s)]
*  You write that this economic fragility piece in your report is a threat to the media in 160 out [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4549.36s)]
*  of 180 countries. So that's a pretty high percentage. How much do you see what is happening [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4558.24s)]
*  here now that you just described, kind of Trump coming in behind these economic pressures, [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4566.4s)]
*  as part of a playbook that you're also seeing in other countries that are shifting towards [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4572.4s)]
*  authoritarianism? Like how do you understand this combination of economic fragility and [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4576.719999999999s)]
*  increasingly autocratic leadership globally as a phenomenon that is worldwide? Or do you see [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4583.2s)]
*  different countries have quite different flavors of economic fragility and authoritarianism? [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4591.12s)]
*  The playbook is not new. We have seen this play out in several countries before, most recently in [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4597.280000000001s)]
*  places like Hungary and Turkey and before that in Russia on an even more extreme scale. But it's [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4602.96s)]
*  also a two-way street. The Trump administration takes inspiration from some of these regimes, [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4610.240000000001s)]
*  but it's also impacting the way other governments are behaving towards their press. The world [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4616.96s)]
*  takes notice when the United States government says with a loud clear voice, [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4624.16s)]
*  we no longer defend press freedom, not here and not abroad. I'll just give one example. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4628.4s)]
*  In Serbia, the Ministry of Justice raided the offices of Serda, which is the largest [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4634.72s)]
*  fact-checking organization in Serbia. And in justifying that raid, they put out a press [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4640.0s)]
*  release that says, we know that Serda received a grant from USAID. And we know from Elon Musk [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4644.88s)]
*  that USAID is a criminal organization. Therefore, we have to go in and investigate [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4651.52s)]
*  money laundering because clearly they're taking money from a criminal organization. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4656.56s)]
*  They're not even making us work hard to connect the dots here. They're just very clearly taking [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4661.68s)]
*  the cues from the Trump administration. To take this in the direction of some of the more violent [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4666.4800000000005s)]
*  and extreme threats to journalists and how that connects to how the US does or doesn't advocate [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4673.52s)]
*  for press freedom. Obviously, one of the more extremely dangerous places to be a journalist [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4678.72s)]
*  is been the Middle East, particularly in Gaza and the West Bank. And in addition to the [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4684.16s)]
*  Palestinian journalists who've been killed covering the conflict in Gaza, [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4692.08s)]
*  we've seen in recent years, even before October 7th, a journalist like Shreen Abu Akhla, [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4696.16s)]
*  a Palestinian journalist killed in the West Bank after multiple investigations determined killed by [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4701.84s)]
*  an Israeli sniper. No accountability really. And the US under Biden seemed to not want to talk about [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4710.88s)]
*  it. What is the risk of that? When other countries see seeming double standards on where we speak out [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4719.04s)]
*  against threats to journalists or where we demand accountability for violence against journalists, [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4730.56s)]
*  does that have an effect of promoting either impunity or suggesting some degree of hypocrisy [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4735.84s)]
*  and when and where the US chooses to raise its voice about press freedom? [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4744.0s)]
*  Yeah, impunity is something we talk a lot about in the press freedom community. UNESCO has a [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4748.4800000000005s)]
*  statistic that something like 88% of crimes against journalists never receive any kind of justice. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4753.4400000000005s)]
*  And the pernicious problem of impunity is that it just encourages more bad behavior if no one's [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4760.08s)]
*  being held accountable. Shreen Abu Akhla, I think, is a prime example because not only was she very [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4766.8s)]
*  clearly killed in what was a crime against humanity, she's also an American citizen. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4773.2s)]
*  And the US government really did everything it could to sweep this issue under the rug, [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4781.92s)]
*  did not want to raise it with Israel, with Bibi Netanyahu. It really echoed a similar [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4787.36s)]
*  assassination of a journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist who was killed during [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4796.719999999999s)]
*  the Trump administration, was a legal resident of the United States. And the Trump administration [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4801.5199999999995s)]
*  simply did not want to push the Saudis for any accountability there. These kinds of episodes [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4807.44s)]
*  send a clear message to the bad actors who would do this again that they're not going to suffer any [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4813.92s)]
*  kind of repercussions. And then so it's maybe not surprising, it's shocking, but not surprising that [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4820.16s)]
*  the United States also has failed to stand up for the hundreds of journalists who have been murdered [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4828.08s)]
*  in Gaza, many of whom, as the RSF can document, were killed while doing their jobs as journalists [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4832.4800000000005s)]
*  who were clearly marked as journalists or traveling in vehicles, they were clearly [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4840.88s)]
*  marked as press, were wearing press vests, were holding microphones, were doing everything they [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4845.04s)]
*  could to make it clear that they were press and were targeted nonetheless. None of them have had [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4850.72s)]
*  justice for their murders. And meanwhile, the Israeli government has continued a blockade against [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4855.84s)]
*  Gaza. International journalists can't get in and can't tell the story. How many times have we heard [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4862.16s)]
*  the Israeli government say something akin to, well, you can't trust the death toll that the [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4869.12s)]
*  Gaza health ministry puts out there because that's just a Hamas propaganda tool and they're not [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4874.48s)]
*  trustworthy. If you really believe that, let the journalists go in and figure it out for themselves. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4879.5199999999995s)]
*  Let independent investigators come to their own conclusions, but they haven't done that. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4884.0s)]
*  Yeah, you don't have a capacity for any international journalists to be there, [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4888.88s)]
*  but also you have this kind of, the Israeli government claiming that anybody who claims to [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4893.44s)]
*  be a journalist is Hamas when, as you can say, you can document- Yeah, and the claims are laughable [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4899.599999999999s)]
*  too. I'm thinking of one in particular where after the fact they accused a journalist of having been [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4904.5599999999995s)]
*  an engineer for Hamas and they pointed to a specific project he had supposedly worked on, [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4911.599999999999s)]
*  he would have been about eight years old at that time if he had really had, that's a pretty [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4916.799999999999s)]
*  far-fetched claim to be making. Yeah. Well, it's just one other global piece that emanates from the [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4921.68s)]
*  United States because I think it is important. You obviously have the cuts to VOA, the Voice of [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4927.6s)]
*  America, and international broadcasting generally, but I think people also aren't aware that USAID [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4933.12s)]
*  funding reaches a lot of support for independent journalism in other countries. People may say, [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4939.68s)]
*  hey, that sounds sketchy. Why is USAID funding journalism? But as someone who's worked on this, [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4945.44s)]
*  this is often money that passes through other entities that are more impartial and is meant to [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4950.56s)]
*  train journalists, is meant to help be a lifeline in poorer countries where there's not a lot of [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4957.68s)]
*  revenue as we talked about economic fragility for journalism. What do you see as the impact of this [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4964.400000000001s)]
*  kind of US retreat under Trump from any funding source whatsoever for Radio Free Europe or Asia, [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4969.4400000000005s)]
*  for VOA, for USAID and its journals and partners? It is just a massive gift to authoritarian [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4975.6s)]
*  censorship regimes like China, like Iran, like Russia, who are just giddy at the prospects of [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4983.120000000001s)]
*  being able to come in and fill the void that's being left behind by US leadership in these spaces. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4990.320000000001s)]
*  I think you brought up a really good point, which is that sometimes people get a little squeamish [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=4996.240000000001s)]
*  when they hear about the US government funding media projects. I think that's an understandable [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5002.0s)]
*  reaction. The key to remember here is that funding was going towards things like safety training. I [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5006.48s)]
*  know of one program in particular in South America that was training journalists to be safe while [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5014.56s)]
*  reporting in the Amazon on issues like illegal mining and illegal foresting and what are the [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5023.44s)]
*  best practices for reporting out from remote areas where you don't necessarily have a connection to [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5031.68s)]
*  the outside world. That program just stopped. They didn't have the money to keep it going anymore, [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5037.76s)]
*  and they're not going to be able to start it up again even if by some miracle the funding gets [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5041.92s)]
*  turned on again. It's just over. A lot of funding was going to Ukraine to help their beleaguered [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5045.52s)]
*  press who are covering an extremely bloody war. This money goes towards worthy causes. We can [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5050.88s)]
*  have a conversation about whether or not the United States needs to be funding all of these [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5059.28s)]
*  things, but simply cutting off the funding overnight through the entire field into chaos. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5063.2s)]
*  Like I said, it has completely opened the door to, for example, the Chinese Communist Party, [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5069.2s)]
*  which has no qualms about going in and setting up outright propaganda outlets. In one case, [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5074.8s)]
*  I know that the airwaves that VOA was once broadcasting over have now been taken over, [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5081.759999999999s)]
*  thankfully by the BBC, which is another state broadcaster, so it could be a lot worse. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5087.68s)]
*  That's kind of the point here is you can't just turn this back on easily once you shut it off. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5095.360000000001s)]
*  The world will move on. Plus, when you're talking about Radio Free Europe and Voice of America, [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5102.8s)]
*  these public interest broadcasters who are basically like public media but for the rest [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5107.76s)]
*  of the world, their audience is not going to trust these outlets anymore because they're just going [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5111.84s)]
*  to assume, well, they got turned back on and now this is just pro-Trump propaganda from the US [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5117.52s)]
*  government. Yeah. People probably don't realize the reach of these entities, dozens of countries, [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5122.240000000001s)]
*  dozens of languages, hundreds of millions of people. Now, we focus on the grim outlook [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5130.240000000001s)]
*  economically and politically. What did you find, bright spots? Would you point to places where, [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5136.4800000000005s)]
*  hey, this is an interesting way of responding to the economic pressures on journalism in X [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5143.12s)]
*  country or region or we saw this positive trajectory in a particular country. Where do [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5149.12s)]
*  you see not only bright spots but approaches that might be replicated to push back against this [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5156.08s)]
*  alarming trend? Yeah. Well, once again, Norway is at the top of the list for, I believe, the eighth [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5162.0s)]
*  year running. They're actually the only country where on all five indicators they got our good [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5168.16s)]
*  rating. They're green across the board. We can't all be Norway though. Norway is a very rich country [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5174.32s)]
*  that has a very strong democratic tradition and very strong legal protections. But the bottom [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5182.88s)]
*  line of what they're getting right here is that there is robust funding for independent media that [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5187.5199999999995s)]
*  is independent of any sort of political handling, which is really the key. Because you can have [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5193.44s)]
*  robustly funded state media, but that's no good for press freedom because it's just PR for the [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5202.799999999999s)]
*  government. You need to have money flowing to journalists to do the work independently of [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5207.36s)]
*  outside influence. The problem in a lot of countries is not necessarily that the media [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5214.08s)]
*  are under the boot of the government. They might just be overly influenced by corporate owners, [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5220.24s)]
*  or there just might be too few voices or too few outlets out there for enough pluralism to exist. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5225.92s)]
*  And so the public is just starved of enough different points of view. We try to take a [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5233.599999999999s)]
*  really holistic view when we're measuring press freedom. That's why we do these five indicators. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5238.5599999999995s)]
*  We do a lot of qualitative and quantitative data. We survey media experts in all 180 countries that [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5243.52s)]
*  we're researching. And we try to get a really, really robust picture of everything that's going [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5250.240000000001s)]
*  on. Because traditionally we think of press freedom as being about the arrest of a journalist, [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5257.200000000001s)]
*  the killing of a journalist. But increasingly the problems facing journalism are a lot more [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5262.96s)]
*  existential or systemic. Because there's a lot of countries where a journalist isn't being killed, [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5267.84s)]
*  but journalism is being killed. And it's being killed by things like a digital information space [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5272.96s)]
*  that is rigged against journalism because the algorithms are burying it. Or it's being killed [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5280.4800000000005s)]
*  by a crisis of trust between the public and the news media. And so people are turning away [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5287.44s)]
*  from journalism as a source of information. By the way, these are factors that are really [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5293.12s)]
*  driving down the US's score. So it's not all Trump necessarily. It's a variety of things that are [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5298.16s)]
*  contributing to an erosion of press freedom. Something that's been happening in the United [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5303.36s)]
*  States for the past decade, frankly, when we started doing this in 2002, the United States was ranked [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5307.76s)]
*  17th. Now we're at 57th. You can't blame that all on Trump. Also, it's worth noting all of this data [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5313.28s)]
*  from the index was collected last year in 2024. So everything that's happened under Trump since he [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5320.08s)]
*  took office in January, not part of this index, which is the scary part because it could get so [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5324.88s)]
*  much worse. Yeah, probably not. I wouldn't be betting on a huge surge for the US in the rankings [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5330.08s)]
*  next year. Well, look, Clayton, thank you so much for joining us. I would encourage people [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5337.4400000000005s)]
*  to think about these issues because if journalism and press freedom does get kind of strangled in [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5343.36s)]
*  the way that we're seeing, we really will be living in a world without any prospect of shared [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5350.32s)]
*  truth, reality, or accountability. I'm actually just coincidentally, Clayton, been reading a book [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5355.599999999999s)]
*  about Vietnam, classic, a bright shining lie, that kind of reminds you that if journalists [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5362.24s)]
*  didn't tell us the truth about what was happening in Vietnam, the US government sure as shit wasn't [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5367.5199999999995s)]
*  going to. And that could be the kind of world in which we seem to be headed. So people should [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5371.84s)]
*  definitely check out the World Press Freedom Index. People should support [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5379.2s)]
*  Reporters Without Borders. People should support independent journalism if you can. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5382.4s)]
*  If you're getting news on social media, think about what the original source is. And if the [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5387.76s)]
*  original source is a independent journalistic news outlet or anything that can be supported, [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5393.5199999999995s)]
*  try to do so so that you're not just paying Mark Zuckerberg with your ad revenue on Instagram, [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5401.36s)]
*  or your data. You're actually supporting the raw material. So I didn't mean to give a speech [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5406.8s)]
*  at the end there, Clayton, but I just want people to think about this issue and encourage it and [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5413.76s)]
*  want to thank you for the work you're doing. Well, I appreciate it. We need more evangelists [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5418.24s)]
*  for journalism because, I mean, let's face it, without journalism, we don't have a democracy. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5421.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. We really don't. We just have people who are powerful and who try to tell us [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5427.2s)]
*  what to think. All right. Thanks so much, Clayton. We will keep in touch and wish you the best. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5431.92s)]
*  All right. Thank you, Ben. Thanks again to Clayton Weimers for joining the show. Thanks again to you, [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5438.4800000000005s)]
*  Ben, for logging in from very far away. How long is that flight? [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5442.4s)]
*  It is one of the longest flights in the world. It's like 16 hours. And actually, my kids were [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5447.6s)]
*  really interested in this question of what is the longest direct flight in the world. And New York, [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5454.96s)]
*  Singapore and L.A. Singapore are in the top 10 for sure. Do you like go over the top? [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5459.84s)]
*  Why does this work? I was trying to like, I was looking at the in-flight map, you know, [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5467.360000000001s)]
*  and I almost kind of didn't understand where we were flying. Fair enough. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5474.56s)]
*  Yeah, you're definitely going under, you know. Under the world. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5480.8s)]
*  It depends on which way you're turning the world, but you're going over some serious [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5485.84s)]
*  ocean there for a long time. Yeah, I bet that always makes me a little nervous. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5489.28s)]
*  Although better than going in New York. Exactly. When you look down, when the in-flight map is just [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5493.04s)]
*  the circular earth, but it's only water, you know, Pacific Ocean is a pretty big place. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5496.88s)]
*  Yeah, you're reminded the Pacific Ocean is pretty big. Maybe you can grab on to some of that garbage [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5502.719999999999s)]
*  patch. We floated out in the middle of it if things go bad, but you know, you never know. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5506.16s)]
*  Anyway, fly safe. You'll be fine. Great to see you and talk soon. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5509.92s)]
*  you [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fld-NPJqHw&t=5519.28s)]
