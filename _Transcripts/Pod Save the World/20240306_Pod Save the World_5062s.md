# Why is the US Airdropping Aid to Gaza? | Pod Save The World
**Pod Save the World:** [March 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU)
*  Welcome to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Ben Rhodes. Ben, did you see right before we came in the Department of Justice filed a superseding indictment with more charges for Bob Menendez? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=0.0s)]
*  I saw that in the elevator walking up. I checked our text chain and I was like, what? But I guess these are just the Qatar, that corruption which you read about now turning into an indictment. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=10.0s)]
*  Yeah, he got something of value to benefit Qatar. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=21.0s)]
*  What a surprise. What a shock. What a shock that Bob Menendez is corrupt. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=24.0s)]
*  I texted a former Menendez staffer who's now got a very difficult job in the Biden administration asking if you ever wished he was back in the good old days defending the gold bars shipments and he said no. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=28.0s)]
*  I mean, again, I think I've mentioned this before, but like the funny thing is that I had to deal a lot with the Menendez staff over the years. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=41.0s)]
*  And the time period in which we did the Iran nuclear deal and the Cuban normalization, he was under indictment for his last corruption charge and therefore was no longer the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=48.0s)]
*  And I've always wondered how much more painful that period of time in 2015, 2016 would have been on Cuba and Iran if we had like full bore Bob Menendez, who was also probably spying for multiple foreign governments at the time. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=60.0s)]
*  Yeah, we kind of would have depended on how many gold bars you had to give them. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=74.0s)]
*  But we'll see. But we got a great show for you guys today. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=77.0s)]
*  We are going to talk about the latest from the humanitarian situation in Gaza. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=81.0s)]
*  Vice President Harris is a strong call for a ceasefire in Netanyahu rival Benny Gantz visit to D.C. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=85.0s)]
*  Ben, I wish I was there for some of those meetings. That must be kind of fun. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=91.0s)]
*  We're also going to talk about the State of the Union, what's happening in Haiti, why German military leaders should probably not talk about weapons transfers on open lines, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=94.0s)]
*  unsecure communications lines, the turnout to Alexei Navalny's funeral, abortion rights in France and why it's a bad idea to leak classified documents. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=102.0s)]
*  I've got some of the fallout here for some of these service members who are getting some jail time. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=112.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. It seemed like a fun idea at the time, but that's a good tale to it. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=118.0s)]
*  Yeah, long tale in this case. And then one last check in with our friend Tucker Carlson about his trip to Moscow. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=123.0s)]
*  Not enough. Not enough. We need more content. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=128.0s)]
*  And then Ben, I did a great interview just before you showed up with a woman named Paul Hurt. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=131.0s)]
*  She's a Sudanese political analyst and the founding director of Confluent Advisory. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=135.0s)]
*  It's a think and do tank that used to be based in Khartoum and now is sort of based everywhere. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=140.0s)]
*  But she's doing an amazing, you know, an amazing explainer on, you know, the civil war in Sudan, how it happened, who the warring parties are, how the UAE is funneling weapons into the conflict, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=145.0s)]
*  how little the international community is doing and how different the sort of outside game is. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=157.0s)]
*  Right. Because we talked about how 2003, 2004, there was the Save Darfur movement. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=162.0s)]
*  It was this global star studded activism. And now there's just nothing like it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=166.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm really interested to listen to that interview. And I've been thinking a lot about that last point. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=172.0s)]
*  I was even talking to somebody about it over the weekend that it's a sign it's a failure that there's not more attention. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=176.0s)]
*  But it's also a sign of how the world is so much more just so much more shit going on than even back then. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=182.0s)]
*  Yeah. When there was a lot of shit going back then. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=189.0s)]
*  But like, there's just so limited bandwidth for people to process all this conflict and war and instability. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=191.0s)]
*  So we should pay more attention to this. Yeah. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=199.0s)]
*  It's a great interview. I hope you guys will all check it out. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=202.0s)]
*  But let's start in Gaza and go to the humanitarian situation because over the weekend, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=205.0s)]
*  the United States actually started air dropping humanitarian supplies into Gaza. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=210.0s)]
*  The initial wave of air drops was 66 bundles containing 38,000 meals. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=213.0s)]
*  That will likely be the first of many such air drops. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=219.0s)]
*  But even US officials will tell you that air dropping supplies into Gaza is both inefficient and totally insufficient given the need. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=221.0s)]
*  The fact that the US had to resort to air drops tells you how dire the humanitarian situation is. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=228.0s)]
*  Here's a couple of statistics that help tell that story further. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=233.0s)]
*  The UN says one in six children under the age of two in Gaza is acutely malnourished. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=236.0s)]
*  Eighty percent of mothers in Gaza are skipping meals to feed their kids. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=241.0s)]
*  The World Bank says up to 96 percent of Gaza's agricultural infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=244.0s)]
*  And the UN says that an average of just 98 trucks of aid crossed into Gaza per day in February, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=250.0s)]
*  which is just way, way under the goal of at least 200 trucks per day. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=255.0s)]
*  But even less of that aid is making it into northern Gaza, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=260.0s)]
*  where there are several hundred thousand people who have remained there since the Israeli invasion. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=263.0s)]
*  And they've basically been cut off. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=267.0s)]
*  The UN and the World Food Program have suspended operations in northern Gaza because they can't secure the convoys. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=269.0s)]
*  So there was a horrific incident last week where 100 Gazans were killed and over 700 were wounded [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=275.0s)]
*  after Israeli soldiers opened fire on these desperate people who swarmed an aid convoy [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=281.0s)]
*  and were trying to get flour and other supplies off the truck. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=285.0s)]
*  There's also a very real problem of gangs taking the aid, hoarding it, reselling it at astronomical markups to desperate people. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=288.0s)]
*  So, Ben, I mean, stepping back here, like, what do you think it says about the U.S.-Israel relationship at this point [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=296.0s)]
*  that we can't convince them to allow more aid trucks into Gaza this far into the war and we're now having to air drop? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=303.0s)]
*  I think it's the ultimate sign of a broken policy that has become both like a strategic and moral abomination. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=311.0s)]
*  You know, that we're in a situation where we're arming, you know, it's the obvious point, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=320.0s)]
*  but we're arming the government that is dropping bombs on these people with U.S. bombs. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=325.0s)]
*  And then we're trying to drop U.S. food that is, let's face it, like a drop in the ocean of the need in Gaza. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=331.0s)]
*  Two billion people at least in Gaza. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=337.0s)]
*  Yeah, and to kind of come at this differently, to be specific for people, like to not even respond to all the bits and pieces of news, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=339.0s)]
*  it's like, well, what should the U.S. be doing differently? What could we be doing differently? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=345.0s)]
*  Well, look, I think we could vote for a ceasefire resolution of the United Nations and kind of just fully have the position of the world [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=348.0s)]
*  in the quote unquote rules-based order that we always talk about, be behind a ceasefire. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=356.0s)]
*  We could be saying, you know, the Biden administration clearly doesn't want this RAFA military operation to go forward. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=361.0s)]
*  They could just say no military support, no more assistance to the Israeli government if that operation goes forward. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=365.0s)]
*  They could, because there are concerns clearly in the Biden administration about the far-right nature of the Israeli government. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=373.0s)]
*  Well, Smotrich, the finance minister who's like the extreme far-right settler leader, Ben Gavir, the national security minister we've talked about, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=380.0s)]
*  you could sanction those people. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=388.0s)]
*  We've sanctioned some settler leaders, but these are the actual leaders, you know. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=390.0s)]
*  These are all tools available. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=394.0s)]
*  And then to the Hamas point, then you could say, you know what we're going to do, having taken this principal position, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=396.0s)]
*  we're going to pull together all the countries in the region and the Europeans to say, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=402.0s)]
*  we're going to have to really redouble our efforts to go after Hamas' funding [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=406.0s)]
*  and to try to invest in an alternative Palestinian leadership that's not just this glorotic PA, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=411.0s)]
*  but is like a bottom-up Palestinian civil society leadership that can emerge into a political leadership. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=417.0s)]
*  And kind of really lean on Hamas, obviously, on the hostage circumstance, isolate them in that regard, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=423.0s)]
*  and try to have a viable plan for what the future of Gaza is. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=430.0s)]
*  These are available options. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=435.0s)]
*  There's no requirement that we back Israel while disagreeing with their policy, you know. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=438.0s)]
*  And look, might that fail to move the Israelis? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=446.0s)]
*  This is really government. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=450.0s)]
*  I think it might, but better to be in the right place, principally, and morally, and strategically, globally. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=451.0s)]
*  And then I also want to respond to, like, you know, like as I'm sure you do, Tommy, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=459.0s)]
*  like I get feedback from people that I, many of whom I respect, who are just like, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=464.0s)]
*  I don't understand why you're not focused more on the hostages [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=471.0s)]
*  or why there's not more understanding that Israel shouldn't have to live next to people that want to destroy them. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=474.0s)]
*  I take that very seriously, but what I'd say is, first of all, the hostage point is the one that is most concerning to me [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=484.0s)]
*  because this military operation is not rescuing the hostages. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=492.0s)]
*  So I just don't... [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=495.0s)]
*  Yeah, in fact, a lot of them might have died. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=496.0s)]
*  In the military operation. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=498.0s)]
*  So I get psychologically that there's a wanting to center their humanity in the same way that there's a centering of the humanity in Gaza. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=499.0s)]
*  That is correct, morally and practically, but that doesn't lead inherently to supporting this military operation. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=509.0s)]
*  I actually think it leads the other place. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=518.0s)]
*  But then the more profound point I just make is this Israeli government is not a trustworthy partner. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=519.0s)]
*  And even if you are someone who has an affinity for Israel, the country, and the Israelis as people, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=527.0s)]
*  that doesn't require you to support this Israeli government and what they're doing in Gaza, which is so obviously wrong. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=533.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't know how you can look at this and say, because then the question becomes, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=540.0s)]
*  well, if the reason that we need to support them is because we don't like Hamas, well, how many Palestinians have to die? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=544.0s)]
*  At what point? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=550.0s)]
*  OK, 30,000 is not enough. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=552.0s)]
*  15,000 kids when it's 100,000 because of famine. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=553.0s)]
*  At what point does it become evident that this Israeli government is not going to embed kind of restraint in humanity in its military operations? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=558.0s)]
*  Yeah, I want to talk more about the alternatives to Bibi and also the US response in one second, but I'll still drive this home. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=569.0s)]
*  I mean, there's reports that people are eating animal feed. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=576.0s)]
*  At least 15 kids have died of malnutrition or dehydration at the hospital in northern Gaza at this point. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=579.0s)]
*  And you can't secure these A trucks into the Gaza Strip in part because some of the local, yes, Hamas employed police officers were targeted in airstrikes. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=585.0s)]
*  They're like, no, we're absolutely not going to continue doing our jobs if we're at risk. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=596.0s)]
*  And we also reached out to John England from the Norwegian Refugee Council, who was just on the ground in Gaza, working with his aid organization to get a better sense of what the situation is like. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=600.0s)]
*  Here's a clip. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=610.0s)]
*  We value that the US cares for the population and has now even done airdrops. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=611.0s)]
*  But an airdrop from one of these Hercules C-130 planes, it's one truck, really. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=619.0s)]
*  Three planes, three trucks. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=627.0s)]
*  We need 500 trucks, loads in. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=630.0s)]
*  And of course, the most primitive, the least targeted way of feeding a population is to drop pallets on their heads and then hope that the right people distribute. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=634.0s)]
*  Of course, it's a survival of the fittest in that kind of a situation. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=653.0s)]
*  The poorest women and children will not get the relief in that kind of a chaotic distribution. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=657.0s)]
*  And then, you know, Ben, Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland went to the Senate floor today, you know, sort of a middle of the road, relatively centrist Democrat. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=667.0s)]
*  He was furious about the restrictions on a trucks getting into Gaza. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=676.0s)]
*  And he laid out some of the similar things that you just mentioned about what Biden should do about it. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=681.0s)]
*  Here's a clip from that speech. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=685.0s)]
*  Unless and until the Netanyahu government allows more relief into Gaza, the president Biden needs to invoke Section 620 I of the Foreign Assistance Act. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=686.0s)]
*  Madam President, here's the exact language of that section of the Foreign Assistance Act. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=697.0s)]
*  It just speaks to the fact that there's tools available that could be used right now. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=728.0s)]
*  And what's frustrating is sometimes in their talking points, the administration's pivots to these things. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=732.0s)]
*  They say, well, you know, there are conditions for human rights violations and well, yeah, but if you don't enforce them, then what's the point? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=736.0s)]
*  You know, and what I think Senator Van Hollen's saying, and look, consider aid trucks, because what if the US was like, you know what we're going to do? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=746.0s)]
*  We are going to do in Egypt with our partners, load up 500 aid trucks and just drive them to that crossing. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=753.0s)]
*  And, you know, is Israel going to stop them? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=760.0s)]
*  You know, like because everything is just asking for a couple more trucks. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=765.0s)]
*  And, you know, you could just do things. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=769.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, we're currently just air dropping, currently just air dropping. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=772.0s)]
*  So we are doing something that is just we've decided to go around the Israeli government in some way. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=775.0s)]
*  But as you heard, just dropping pallets of food on people beyond the optic of it being a little dehumanizing, right? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=780.0s)]
*  More than a little like it's just like we're just dropping food on people. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=787.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's dangerous. And it's not at a scale that makes the difference it needs to be made. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=790.0s)]
*  So I think it just it is the case that there are alternatives of ill. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=794.0s)]
*  Yeah. So Vice President Harris delivered a speech over the weekend where she forcefully called for a ceasefire. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=799.0s)]
*  Here's a clip from those remarks. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=805.0s)]
*  And given the immense scale of suffering in Gaza, there must be an immediate ceasefire. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=806.0s)]
*  For at least the next six weeks, which is what is currently on the table. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=816.0s)]
*  This will get the hostages out and get a significant amount of aid in. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=826.0s)]
*  This would allow us to build something more enduring to ensure Israel is secure and to respect the right of the Palestinian people to dignity, freedom and self-determination. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=833.0s)]
*  So just to be clear, folks, I mean, the vice president is not proposing any new policy there. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=849.0s)]
*  The administration has been pushing for a six week ceasefire for a while. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=853.0s)]
*  President Biden and other officials have talked about it publicly, including in the Seth Meyers interview that we clipped on this show last week. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=858.0s)]
*  But the way the vice president spoke there was forceful. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=865.0s)]
*  It was phrased as a demand. It was delivered at an event about civil rights. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=869.0s)]
*  So like the context felt different to people. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=873.0s)]
*  And the result was she got cheers from an audience at a time when every other public event is getting protested and speakers are getting shouted down, including President Biden. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=876.0s)]
*  And I just think like that, the speech and that reaction highlights the flaws with the administration's hug BB strategy and not being wanting to be perceived as disagreeing with Netanyahu publicly. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=886.0s)]
*  It's literally the difference between getting cheered and protested at your own event over the same policy. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=898.0s)]
*  Yeah, because we have to occasionally be a little light here. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=903.0s)]
*  It was like Jason Kelsey at the Bills game, like in the audience. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=907.0s)]
*  There's one guy that was really going like, but anyway. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=910.0s)]
*  But anyway, in pivoting the series, yeah, I think there's a point in which she represents a real difference and a point at which she doesn't. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=915.0s)]
*  To start with the doesn't, yeah, you're right. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=924.0s)]
*  Their policy, which she then said in the next part of the speech is still that there'll be a six week ceasefire around a negotiated release of hostages. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=927.0s)]
*  And kind of what's weird about that policy is like after six weeks and everything starts again. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=937.0s)]
*  Well, the hope I think is that after six weeks it'll be impossible to restart. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=942.0s)]
*  That's exactly right. I think it's actually a smart play. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=945.0s)]
*  Like they put all their chips on this play of like get a six week ceasefire, get a lot of aid in and then use that time to kind of just try to more permanently end this negotiation. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=947.0s)]
*  That if that works, as we talked about last week, that would make things much better. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=956.0s)]
*  If it doesn't, like there's not really another plan. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=963.0s)]
*  And the question is like, how long can the humanitarian circumstances merit it? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=966.0s)]
*  So you're right. What's interesting is that the policy is not different now. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=971.0s)]
*  That leads to what is different. Like she just talks about it differently. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=974.0s)]
*  And, you know, naming something that is a bit uncomfortable, hearing Joe Biden go out at a press conference and being like, I think some of what they're doing is over the top. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=978.0s)]
*  You know, which is about as critical as he's gotten as Israel is very different than the emotion in her voice when she says there must be a ceasefire. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=990.0s)]
*  The Palestinians deserve self-determination. You can tell. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=997.0s)]
*  And I'm not suggesting he's observing the events. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1000.0s)]
*  He sounds like she's feeling the events and trying to dictate them and trying to deliver a strong message. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1003.0s)]
*  And she deserves, I think, again, real credit. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1007.0s)]
*  I mean, some people have said, well, yeah, but it's no different. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1011.0s)]
*  Well, she's not the president. So she's not able to make the policy. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1013.0s)]
*  And I think that's the first time, you know, and again, this is not to say that Tony Blinken hasn't tried to be empathetic. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1017.0s)]
*  And but there's just such a real like there's a connection between like how she seems to feel about the issue and what she's saying and the way she's saying it that has been missing. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1025.0s)]
*  And frankly, again, as you said, the fact that she got the response that she did, even though the policy hasn't changed, shows you that just doing that would make a difference in red in clocking with people. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1035.0s)]
*  We don't like what's going on. We want it to stop. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1046.0s)]
*  And like the White House response, I mean, it's super frustrating in any White House when people try to find daylight between the president and his team or the president and the vice president. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1049.0s)]
*  So I think they did a lot of work to like, like, no, she was saying the exact same thing he did and kind of almost played down her remarks after the fact. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1059.0s)]
*  NBC News reported that NBC officials actually might have softened some of the tone of Harris's speech. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1066.0s)]
*  And then they, you know, someone told Politico that Harris's remarks were actually designed to put pressure on Hamas to accept the ceasefire deal because it's on the table. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1072.0s)]
*  And like, I don't know, maybe that's true. But something tells me that Hamas leaders sitting in some fucking tunnel somewhere probably weren't listening to the speech. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1081.0s)]
*  I felt like a, you know, like, as you were saying earlier, there's something that she felt and she wants to see the suffering end. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1088.0s)]
*  But I don't look at look as someone I want to see the administration do more substantively. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1095.0s)]
*  I want them to stop with these unilateral arms transfers. I want to see conditions on future military aid. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1099.0s)]
*  I'd love to see calls for, you know, Rokana was making the case that Hamas is not agreeing to these ceasefire deals because they want much longer duration ceasefires. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1104.0s)]
*  So if the US started pressuring Israel on a three month ceasefire, say, we're more likely to get that deal done. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1114.0s)]
*  I'd be all for that. Like, the longer we can stop the fighting and get humanitarian support in, the better. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1120.0s)]
*  But, you know, I was like, I saw that clip of the speech going around over the weekend. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1126.0s)]
*  I knew it was the same policy, but I still was like, yes, this is good. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1130.0s)]
*  Yeah. Or on the Hamas point, maybe like the arsonists in Hamas, like, don't want a ceasefire because they know that what Israel is doing is massively. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1133.0s)]
*  Validating among a lot of people like their their ideology of resistance, you know, like, and that's saying that's right. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1146.0s)]
*  I'm saying opposite. I'm saying, why are we giving them this enormous agency over what's right or wrong? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1154.0s)]
*  Like this military operation is not working, and I don't feel like I need Hamas to make an agreement in order to confirm that this military operation should stop for everybody involved. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1160.0s)]
*  For the Palestinian people, for the Israeli people, even if they are, you know, are out for vengeance, it's not working for them. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1174.0s)]
*  And certainly for us in global interest. So I just would it be great if Hamas agreed to the maximum number of hostages? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1182.0s)]
*  Absolutely. I also think that stopping the military operation doesn't mean you don't keep trying to negotiate hostage releases. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1191.0s)]
*  And frankly, if you're moving a bunch of aid in getting a bunch of other actors into Gaza, it might be, you know, that might give you a different vehicle to try to approach this. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1198.0s)]
*  Yeah, maybe time for a more targeted, limited hostage rescue. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1206.0s)]
*  Focus on hostages, you know, and then in terms of the White House, the name you described, we've all been there. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1210.0s)]
*  And look, it is what it is. It's pretty obvious. Like, she's in a bit of a different place, at least in terms of how she is interacting politically with the issue. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1216.0s)]
*  And you can't really paper over that. You know, the policy hasn't changed. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1226.0s)]
*  Look, it speaks to what's weird about this. She got a good response. And they're trying to clean that up. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1231.0s)]
*  I know. Like that's like we've been there in the White House. It's always bad when you're like, no, that thing that you think happened that was good didn't happen. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1239.0s)]
*  Well, and again, in full disclosure, like Joe Biden got out ahead of Barack Obama on coming out in favor of gay marriage. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1246.0s)]
*  And it was a huge dust up and pissed at him for it. Right. So like we've all been there on the wrong side of this kind of issue, too. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1253.0s)]
*  But I will was worth pointing out that the American people are growing increasingly uncomfortable with the war. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1259.0s)]
*  There was a Wall Street Journal poll out the other day. Forty two percent of voters said that Israel has gone too far in pursuing Hamas. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1265.0s)]
*  Nineteen percent said Israel hasn't gone far enough. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1271.0s)]
*  Twenty four percent is that Israel's response to Hamas has been about right. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1274.0s)]
*  So but it's a growing number of people that are just concerned about the carnage. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1277.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's some 19 percent. Yeah, I don't like those. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1281.0s)]
*  Oh, Trump kind of sits along those lines today. Yeah, he's like, sometimes you got to do what you had to do. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1285.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's just completely amoral about it. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1290.0s)]
*  So then pretty much everyone in Washington, I think, is excited about the post-Net and Yahoo era of Israeli politics. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1292.0s)]
*  One possible successor is a guy named Benny Gantz. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1298.0s)]
*  Gantz spent nearly 40 years in the Israeli military. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1300.0s)]
*  That included four years as the chief of the general staff, which is basically the highest ranking professional soldier in the IDF. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1303.0s)]
*  Gantz got into politics in 2018. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1309.0s)]
*  He served in a bunch of top political positions, including minister of defense. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1311.0s)]
*  He was the alternate prime minister in that brief power sharing agreement with Netanyahu. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1316.0s)]
*  And then after the October 7th attack, Gantz joined Netanyahu's war cabinet. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1320.0s)]
*  So that brings us to today. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1325.0s)]
*  Gantz is visiting Washington on Tuesday, March 5th. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1327.0s)]
*  He had meetings with the vice president, the national security adviser, secretary of state in defense. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1330.0s)]
*  He was up on Capitol Hill. I think he met with Mitch McConnell, for example. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1335.0s)]
*  So Haaretz reported that Gantz, the visit itself, enraged Netanyahu, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1339.0s)]
*  and that Bibi Netanyahu told Israel's ambassador to the U.S. not to assist Benny Gantz at all during his visit or to join any of his meetings. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1345.0s)]
*  Some unity government. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1353.0s)]
*  Also, Ben, some listeners might remember that back in 2015, Netanyahu went around Obama's back, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1354.0s)]
*  scheduled a joint address to Congress with Boehner and Mitch McConnell. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1359.0s)]
*  So Bibi getting pissed about Gantz going behind his back to visit Washington. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1363.0s)]
*  It's just it's beautiful symmetry. I do love when karma happens like that. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1368.0s)]
*  But what do you make of the Biden team inviting Gantz for a visit, knowing full well this is going to be the reaction? [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1372.0s)]
*  Look, I think that it's got to be an open secret that they'd much rather deal with the prime minister Gantz than the prime minister Netanyahu. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1379.0s)]
*  And also, by the way, Benny Gantz is a military guy. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1386.0s)]
*  He's probably someone who's much more qualified to have a conversation about things like aid deliveries and military strategies generally than Netanyahu. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1390.0s)]
*  Like fucking Ron Dermer or whatever. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1403.0s)]
*  Yeah, Ron. Yeah, exactly. Well, they sent Ron Dermer to have these conversations. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1405.0s)]
*  I'm like, General Dermer, you know, this guy is not some expert on, you know, this guy was literally a political operative. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1408.0s)]
*  Right. So if people are wondering, what's the difference? [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1415.0s)]
*  I think it is totally the case that Benny Gantz is pretty hard ass and has been throughout this operation in Gaza. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1419.0s)]
*  So nobody think should think this is like a peacenik. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1427.0s)]
*  You would not like his policies on the two state solution or Gaza properly. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1429.0s)]
*  Yeah, they were spelled out. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1432.0s)]
*  The reason why I still think it's far preferable to Netanyahu is Netanyahu is kind of uniquely been duplicitous with the United States government. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1433.0s)]
*  You know, he like dishonest. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1442.0s)]
*  You know what you just said, like working around presidents, like constantly playing this far right politics game, whereas Gantz has tried to play this center right political coalition. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1444.0s)]
*  So to me, yeah, it doesn't mean that, you know, Yitzhak Rabin is now the prime minister of Israel again or Shimon Peres. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1456.0s)]
*  But I'd rather have like a more straight shooter center right version of an Israeli leader than this Netanyahu, this kind of corrupt, you know, guy that plays to the far right and kind of tries to undermine America. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1463.0s)]
*  I don't think Benny Gantz would be like trying to work around the U.S. president or, you know, so I it'd be an improvement. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1481.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, to your point, Benny Gantz has real military expertise. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1488.0s)]
*  He's also not clinging to the job desperately to stay out of prison. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1491.0s)]
*  It's kind of like, you know, I would rather Nikki Haley be president than Donald Trump. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1496.0s)]
*  I'm not saying either of them is, you know, but it's just like there is a world in which it's better to have someone that you disagree with on a bunch of stuff who's not as, you know, unique, uniquely terrible. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1503.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1514.0s)]
*  So Axios reported that Gantz got a ton of frustrated questions and criticism about the humanitarian situation in Gaza. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1515.0s)]
*  They said that Gantz was surprised at how far apart the U.S. and Israel are when it comes to a potential operation in Ra'a the city in southern Gaza that Netanyahu says he wants to come in next. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1522.0s)]
*  So hopefully it was a meeting that was a wake up call. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1531.0s)]
*  Useful that he came to town. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1533.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1534.0s)]
*  Confirms. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1535.0s)]
*  Well, if he's surprised, well, anyway. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1536.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's surprised by that. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1538.0s)]
*  He picked up any newspaper. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1539.0s)]
*  Ben, so the other big news for Biden this week is the State of the Union coming up on Thursday. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1540.0s)]
*  You had the pleasure of working on this nightmare of a speech for eight years, eight times during the Obama administration. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1547.0s)]
*  So I wanted to play a quick clip of my favorite Obama State of the Union. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1553.0s)]
*  I'm pretty sure you wrote this section. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1558.0s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1560.0s)]
*  My fellow Americans, the State of the Union is strong. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1561.0s)]
*  As we build roads here at home between Indianapolis and Pittsburgh, we must also forge ties abroad between Israelis and Palestinians and pave a proper pathway to peace. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1564.0s)]
*  While we make historic investments in bridges forged with American iron and steel, we must also fortify our allies with the Iron Dome missile defense system. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1575.0s)]
*  From Keeakuk to Keeve, our resolve is resolute, our destiny daring and determined, our optimism obstinate. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1586.0s)]
*  Where'd you summon those words from? [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1594.0s)]
*  Confirming that AI is going to replace all speech writers. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1597.0s)]
*  That is outstanding. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1601.0s)]
*  I've been swearing too much on the show. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1604.0s)]
*  I got to stop. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1605.0s)]
*  But 11 Labs, the AI software I use, will no longer allow me to make Biden voices. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1606.0s)]
*  I wonder if it was because of that robocall thing. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1610.0s)]
*  I think because of the election, probably. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1612.0s)]
*  Come on. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1613.0s)]
*  Yeah, election deepfakes are getting additional attention. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1614.0s)]
*  The joke that you're making that I think is hilarious and Favre and I- [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1617.0s)]
*  The joke for only you and John. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1622.0s)]
*  Yeah, Favre and I and Cody Keenan, every State of the Union had two parts. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1624.0s)]
*  It had the domestic policy and the foreign policy. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1632.0s)]
*  And these were not equal real estate. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1635.0s)]
*  No, it's not even close. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1637.0s)]
*  Because the David Axelrods and David Plus of the world are like, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1639.0s)]
*  the last thing we want to do is stand in front of all these people and talk about the conflict in X. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1641.0s)]
*  Yeah, Myanmar. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1647.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1648.0s)]
*  So you're fighting for real estate, but every time there's this hilarious transition. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1649.0s)]
*  And it's always a version of, and just as we're doing X at home, so must we do Y abroad every single year. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1653.0s)]
*  And every year we're like, we're going to come up with a better transition. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1661.0s)]
*  And there is none. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1665.0s)]
*  There is no better transition. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1666.0s)]
*  The AI, I'm glad recognizes it. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1667.0s)]
*  And every year Obama's like, we're going to do a short one this year. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1668.0s)]
*  30 minutes in and out. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1671.0s)]
*  Never happen. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1673.0s)]
*  Every year, having worked on 8, which is like a- I think I've told you this joke I told Obama, [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1674.0s)]
*  which is working on 8 State of the Unions. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1680.0s)]
*  I may be the only person who's done that as a speechwriter, but it's kind of like- [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1682.0s)]
*  and now we're going to get probably alienate, not alienate, but lose most of our audience, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1687.0s)]
*  because it's both age and sports. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1691.0s)]
*  But it's kind of like in Bull Derm, Crash Davis setting the record for minor league home runs. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1693.0s)]
*  It just applies to longevity at a certain level that is not the principal level. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1698.0s)]
*  Great movie. Everyone should see that movie. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1703.0s)]
*  But those processes were crazy. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1706.0s)]
*  You remember when you were working at the NSC, every single director in the NSC cooks up a memo [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1707.0s)]
*  about why their thing should be in the State of the Union. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1714.0s)]
*  Can you please say my country's name? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1716.0s)]
*  Yeah, and then it gets circulated and it's like, if you don't say this country's name, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1717.0s)]
*  it's going to be a big fucking problem. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1722.0s)]
*  And then I go to David Axelman, like, we got to say the name of fictional country. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1724.0s)]
*  And then they're like, are you fucking crazy? We can't do that. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1729.0s)]
*  And then we wouldn't do it. And guess what? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1732.0s)]
*  It was a big problem when he wouldn't say the name of these- [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1734.0s)]
*  like one year he didn't mention Latin America or something, and he had to travel to Latin America. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1737.0s)]
*  Because he didn't mention it in the State of the Union. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1742.0s)]
*  It's so good. It's also- you're right. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1745.0s)]
*  It is mostly domestic speech, a foreign policy chunk. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1747.0s)]
*  They throw the NSC nerds a bone. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1750.0s)]
*  There's also the theater elements. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1753.0s)]
*  There's some moving moment where everyone applauds for the person in the president's box. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1755.0s)]
*  I like that stuff. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1760.0s)]
*  I love that stuff too. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1761.0s)]
*  Well, so I just saw a report that Yulia Navalnaya, Alexei Navalny's widow, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1762.0s)]
*  was invited to attend but apparently can't make it. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1766.0s)]
*  That would have been powerful. I'm kind of curious what the backstory is there. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1768.0s)]
*  But Ben, any other favorite moments like that for you? [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1771.0s)]
*  And what do you expect from Biden on this? [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1775.0s)]
*  I imagine we'll get a lot of the supplemental funding bill, Ukraine, Israel support. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1776.0s)]
*  We'll probably hear the word Indo-Pacific. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1781.0s)]
*  So favorite moment for me ties to why it'd be good to have someone like Yulia Navalnaya or Dasha, his daughter. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1783.0s)]
*  My favorite moment was in 2015, January 2015, we had as part of the Cuban normalization, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1791.0s)]
*  secured the release of Alan Gross, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1800.0s)]
*  who was an older American man who was a USCID subcontractor, been put in prison for years by the time he was released. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1802.0s)]
*  And he'd become a person of interest to Congress and actually particularly to hardliners, right? [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1814.0s)]
*  Because the hardliners championed Alan Gross's case as evidence of the Cuban government being terrible for having locked him up. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1820.0s)]
*  He was working with the Cuban Jewish community. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1827.0s)]
*  So there was a powerful support for him within the kind of Jewish community in Congress and within those constituencies. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1829.0s)]
*  And so Obama did this Cuban normalization, which was popular with some people, but deeply unpopular with others. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1839.0s)]
*  But then when you have the embodiment of it, when you get to the moment where you're like, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1847.0s)]
*  and here because of what we've done in normalizing relations with Cuba, we can welcome Alan Gross to the State of the Union. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1854.0s)]
*  You both have a nice human moment where Alan Gross deserves after these years in prison, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1861.0s)]
*  this kind of sense of the validation of the country. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1865.0s)]
*  But also it's like, what do you do if you're Marco Rubio? Do you not stand and applaud for politics? [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1869.0s)]
*  And so the way to be skillful at a human level and frankly, I don't think it's crass, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1875.0s)]
*  it's because I think Julian Navalny would support it, is that I'd have people up there, Ukrainians who've suffered acutely in the war, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1880.0s)]
*  and the Navalny family, like the people that will shame those Republicans, because what are they going to do? [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1890.0s)]
*  If there's a veteran who's lost an amputee, and again, this is not using people because these people support these causes. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1898.0s)]
*  A Ukrainian parent whose children have been abducted into Russia, if you have people like that there and are like, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1908.0s)]
*  we need to support these people, it is both a powerful human moment and it's also like, what do you do Mike Johnson? [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1914.0s)]
*  Do you not stand up and applaud? Is everybody going to look at you and wonder why you're either heartless or gutless? [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1919.0s)]
*  Because you're heartless if you don't stand up and applaud, and you're gutless if you stand up and applaud and then don't bring a bill to the floor. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1925.0s)]
*  That's a good point. You couldn't get Fidel Castro? I bet you put that memo in. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1930.0s)]
*  Yeah. If Fidel just smoked a cigar. That would have been another way to go. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1934.0s)]
*  To your point, the First Lady has special guests with her in the box. Members of Congress also invite guests. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1938.0s)]
*  So like Matt Geitz will have some intern he met at the bar last night. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1944.0s)]
*  By the way, Wildest Whenever? Yeah. Achmed Chalabi. Whoa, curveball? [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1948.0s)]
*  Yeah, fucking Bush people had him in Laura Bush's box. It turned out he was an Iranian agent. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1952.0s)]
*  Nice, well done. Was he curveball? No, maybe he was. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1957.0s)]
*  The point is that none of these scandals stick to these guys. Yeah, no. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1962.0s)]
*  But to your point about Speaker Mike Johnson, I thought that Evan Gurskiewicz's parents are attending the State of the Union as a guest of Speaker Mike Johnson. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1965.0s)]
*  Evan is the Wall Street Journal reporter who's been held hostage by Putin for nearly a year. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1974.0s)]
*  It is odd to me that Johnson would not see the irony of hosting Evan while he's simultaneously giving Putin this enormous gift by blocking Ukraine aid. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1978.0s)]
*  There's a number of family members of American hostages being held in Gaza who are attending as guests of members of Congress. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1987.0s)]
*  So here's a clip from a conversation we had with Yaya Alexander, the mother of Aidan Alexander, who's being held by Hamas in Gaza. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=1994.0s)]
*  Right before we like hang up, I told him, listen, Aidan, I'm here. I'm with you. Don't forget about it. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2003.0s)]
*  Whenever you want to text me or to call me, I'm here. I'm by the phone. I love you. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2010.0s)]
*  And we hang up. And that was the last time that I heard the sound of his voice. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2015.0s)]
*  I didn't know it will be the last time that I will hear my son, you know. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2027.0s)]
*  Like I cannot breathe. Like I stopped breathing since October 7th. Today it's 150 days. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2034.0s)]
*  Like this is pure hell for all of us. Like we need to get Yidan's back. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2042.0s)]
*  And this is something that we are going to say again and again and again, also in D.C., to tell everyone, listen, we still in it. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2048.0s)]
*  We still live October 7th. My son, all the other loved ones over there, they're alive and they're still waiting to come to come back, like to be free from this. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2059.0s)]
*  So, you know, the state union is a bit of an anachronistic event, right? [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2074.0s)]
*  Like fewer people watch, fewer people consume the whole thing. But stories like that, moments like that, the guests in these box, the guests and members of Congress. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2078.0s)]
*  I mean, I think they do really make it a powerful night still and something worth watching. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2085.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I think it's important to have constant visibility on people exactly like that. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2090.0s)]
*  And that's the best use of this is just keep a spotlight on things that people shouldn't look away from. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2095.0s)]
*  Yeah. Keep a spotlight on the human beings who are hurt or helped by policies. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2103.0s)]
*  Put a human face on it. And again, that's a reminder. There's a lot of Americans. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2107.0s)]
*  You know, they're American hostages. They're they're Americans in Gaza. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2110.0s)]
*  And just because they're Israeli Americans or Palestinian Americans doesn't mean they're not American. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2115.0s)]
*  Yeah. Let's take a quick break. We come back. We are going to talk about the situation in Haiti. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2119.0s)]
*  So, Ben, the security situation on the ground in Haiti is just catastrophically bad. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2122.0s)]
*  It has gotten steadily worse and worse and worse since Jovenel Lois, the president of Haiti, was assassinated back in twenty twenty one. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2127.0s)]
*  The United Nations has been advancing a plan to send a multinational peacekeeping force to Haiti. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2134.0s)]
*  The backbone of that force will be made up of police officers from Kenya. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2140.0s)]
*  Last Thursday, the prime minister of Haiti, Ariel Henry, flew to Nairobi to finalize a deal that would help basically authorize the deployment of this Kenyan police force. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2144.0s)]
*  There was a court ruling in Kenya that had been blocking it. So they needed to cut this deal. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2154.0s)]
*  When he left, all hell broke loose. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2159.0s)]
*  Armed gangs, including one led by a guy named Barbecue, basically took over Port-au-Prince. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2161.0s)]
*  They said they wanted to topple the government. They wanted to prevent Henry from returning to Haiti. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2167.0s)]
*  By the way, he was appointed, not elected after Moïse's assassination, and he's refused to schedule elections since. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2172.0s)]
*  A lot of Haitians don't view the government as legitimate. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2178.0s)]
*  But these gangs attacked a couple of jails. They allowed four thousand inmates to escape. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2181.0s)]
*  Haiti's government ended up declaring a 72-hour state of emergency. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2187.0s)]
*  So the situation right now is just, I mean, it's completely lawless. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2190.0s)]
*  The Haitian police force is about 9,000 people. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2194.0s)]
*  That's nowhere near enough to combat this level of violence in a country of 11 million people. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2197.0s)]
*  It's not entirely clear to me what a thousand more police from Kenya will be able to do in this instance, assuming they get to Haiti at all. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2202.0s)]
*  It's certainly a good start. But, you know, President Biden has ruled out sending U.S. troops to Haiti for good reason. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2210.0s)]
*  The U.S. has pledged money. But I don't know. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2216.0s)]
*  Like, it's just every time we talk about this, the situation gets more dire. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2218.0s)]
*  And I'm not sure what the end game is at this point. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2223.0s)]
*  No. And, you know, it's the definition of a failed state. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2227.0s)]
*  That's a term that kind of gets thrown around, you know, kind of wonky. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2232.0s)]
*  But like, this is actually a place where there's not really a governing authority. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2236.0s)]
*  And therefore it's just, you know, might makes right. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2240.0s)]
*  And if it's barbecue one day, you know, that's who it is. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2244.0s)]
*  And in that case, and look, I want to just be clear, like, we could do like a several hour podcast on why that dynamic is rooted in a history in which like Haitians themselves are not to blame. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2247.0s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2264.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, this, you know, the fingerprints of the U.S., France, the West, white people is all over this. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2265.0s)]
*  In the current moment, the question is, what, what, how do you deal with the failed state of this scale? [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2273.0s)]
*  And again, in a functioning, you know, international community, this would be a case where I think you just need to figure out some way to negotiate a significant international presence and assistance mission that ties into kind of some Haitian civil society that can lead to a governing authority. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2280.0s)]
*  This is the beginning of that. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2298.0s)]
*  I think just having, you know, the Kenyans at least are showing up without, you know, the kind of corruption or trade offs that have had to be made by various Haitian security forces and gangs. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2300.0s)]
*  You hope that they can sustain that and therefore just provide some stabilizing entity. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2311.0s)]
*  It's not clearly going to be enough, but can you build out from that into something that's a larger scaled and more successful international mission that ties into kind of a non gang related governing? [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2317.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, to your point, I think we want to figure out a way to do a deeper dive on this sometime soon to get some more of the context. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2330.0s)]
*  So stay tuned for that. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2336.0s)]
*  Back in Europe, Ben, there's a very Cold War era feeling scandal brewing in Germany right now. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2338.0s)]
*  Margarita Simonian, the head of a Russian state TV network called RT, posted a leaked recording of German military officials discussing how Taurus long range cruise missiles could be used by Kiev against Russian forces. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2343.0s)]
*  So this audio is the head of Germany's Air Force talking with three other top officers. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2358.0s)]
*  They're talking about how the deployment of these missiles would only be possible with the participation of German soldiers on the ground because actually training the Ukrainian soldiers to use them would take a long time. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2364.0s)]
*  Anyway, this tape leaks. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2374.0s)]
*  The German Chancellor had previously said all of Schultz had said that Germany will absolutely not be delivering these missiles to Ukraine. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2377.0s)]
*  The concern is they can strike Moscow potentially. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2384.0s)]
*  They're too long range and they're worried about them being used for offensive operations within Russia and Germany being blamed. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2387.0s)]
*  So now the Germans are saying they're launching an investigation into how this audio fell into Russian hands. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2393.0s)]
*  I suspect that investigation will start and end with because these guys were using like a WebEx, unsecured program and not I don't know whatever military comms they normally would use. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2399.0s)]
*  But the leak also comes right after French President Emmanuel Macron said that Europe shouldn't rule out sending Western troops to Ukraine, which is kind of a bizarre and inflammatory comment that seemingly was vetted by no one else beforehand. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2409.0s)]
*  So Ben, this whole thing made me think back to 2014 when audio of a conversation between a top Obama administration official named Toria Nuland appeared on YouTube. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2423.0s)]
*  She was talking to the then US ambassador to Ukraine. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2433.0s)]
*  They were disparaging the European Union's lack of support for Ukraine at the moment. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2436.0s)]
*  What do you think Putin has to gain from plucking out this German audio and leaking it onto the into the world to RT in this case? [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2441.0s)]
*  Well, so in that case, that was a really interesting case because I remember coming to work the Toria case. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2450.0s)]
*  Yeah, the Toria case. It came to me first because it was a community was seen as a communications issue. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2457.0s)]
*  There was a press story, you know, all these press stories because he basically put this up on YouTube. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2463.0s)]
*  And so, you know, you know what it's like when it's weird. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2467.0s)]
*  It's a policy thing, but it's actually coming in from a communications door. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2471.0s)]
*  And what she so Toria Nuland, Assistant Secretary of State for Europe at the time, was talking on a cell phone. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2476.0s)]
*  I'm sure she regrets with Jeff Pyatt, the US ambassador in Kiev. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2483.0s)]
*  And there were two things that stood out. One is she was talking about who could be prime minister of Ukraine. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2488.0s)]
*  That's right. And she said yachts would be good yachts in your coup. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2493.0s)]
*  By the way, I ended up becoming president of Ukraine. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2496.0s)]
*  So it sounded like the US was picking Ukraine's leader, validating Putin's theory that we were, you know, engineering regime change. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2498.0s)]
*  You know, what she was doing is what a diplomat does is thinking about like, well, this shit hits a fan like who's, you know, like she's, you know, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2508.0s)]
*  she can debate whether she should have been even having that conversation. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2514.0s)]
*  But I think she would say it was more just like you make all kinds of plans and speculate all kinds of ways about who could be a political leader. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2517.0s)]
*  But so that served the particular interest of showing like some some validation of some Russian conspiracy theory. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2523.0s)]
*  Then the second piece was the EU wanted to do something different than Toria did. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2529.0s)]
*  And she said, fuck the EU. And that created a huge problem. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2534.0s)]
*  Because I remember Angela Merkel was like, what the hell? [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2540.0s)]
*  This is your chief diplomat to Europe who's saying fuck Europe. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2543.0s)]
*  And we, Toria, I think I'd apologize. And like Obama had to call Merkel. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2547.0s)]
*  And like, but the point is, I tell that story for two reasons. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2550.0s)]
*  One, it was this threshold. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2554.0s)]
*  I mean, one of the, you know, I think a lot of people know that there's information that is collected, you know. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2556.0s)]
*  But what Russia's done that's different is they release it, you know. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2563.0s)]
*  So there are even some conversations you might have that are like not sensitive, but they're about foreign policy, but like the Russians know it anyway. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2566.0s)]
*  So maybe you're just doing it on an open line because you're like, it's not the end of the world. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2572.0s)]
*  They know it. But it is the end of the world if they release it. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2575.0s)]
*  Right. Embarrassing. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2578.0s)]
*  It's embarrassing. But then also like what is the policy objective? [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2579.0s)]
*  And here I think, you know, he wants to show, just think about what his objectives are. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2583.0s)]
*  He wants to show European, you know, this kind of rudderless European policy. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2587.0s)]
*  There are differences inside of Europe about how to approach this. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2593.0s)]
*  Anything that is like, you know, to carry forward the Toria example, anything that shows division within the coalition opposing him and that kind of validates some narrative of his, that's why he's doing it. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2596.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. And, you know, listen, Putin didn't love those comments by Macron about sending Western troops. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2607.0s)]
*  That's why he again threatened to use nuclear weapons. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2613.0s)]
*  More broadly, the French and the Germans have been in a bit of a pissing match over Germany's feeling that the French are not providing enough aid. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2616.0s)]
*  The Germans gave 17.7 billion euros so far. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2625.0s)]
*  France said they gave 2.6 billion euros. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2630.0s)]
*  They ended up releasing these figures after some German think tank publisher report saying that the French had only given 635 million euros from a really good political report on the issue. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2633.0s)]
*  So there's been some back and forth there. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2643.0s)]
*  I did see in response to this dust up, this Taurus missile can travel 300 miles. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2645.0s)]
*  That is some sort of like stealth technology is designed to hit hardened targets and bunkers. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2651.0s)]
*  And I guess these generals are talking about whether it could hit the Kirch bridge, which links Crimea to Russia, which has been a big target that the Ukrainians have gone after a bunch. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2656.0s)]
*  But in the wake of this coming out, the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbach, called on the German government to intensively consider, reconsider that decision and consider giving the Taurus missile to Ukraine. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2664.0s)]
*  In response, Olaf Scholz is basically like, no, and shut up. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2677.0s)]
*  This is my decision. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2681.0s)]
*  But it is it's it's highlighting fractures between Germany and France and within this German coalition. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2682.0s)]
*  So yeah, pretty useful politically, probably for Putin. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2688.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2690.0s)]
*  I mean, that's the point. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2691.0s)]
*  He wants to kind of sow division, make people not trust each other. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2692.0s)]
*  You know, it is interesting on those questions. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2696.0s)]
*  I'm a little bit I'm sympathetic to Olaf Scholz like Germany, I think, has provided more military assistance than any other country other than the U.S. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2699.0s)]
*  And you wouldn't know that because like Boris Johnson and every British politician is constantly flying to Kiev and beating their chest. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2707.0s)]
*  Emmanuel Macron is constantly holding summits. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2713.0s)]
*  And some of the Germans end up getting all the shit and they're literally writing bigger checks and sending more stuff. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2715.0s)]
*  And by the way, hosting a lot more Ukrainian refugees like they're spending billions of euros on that. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2720.0s)]
*  What's interesting with the Baerbach thing is she's a green and it's interesting that the German greens are these hawks. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2725.0s)]
*  You know, it kind of runs. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2730.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's always been an interesting phenomenon to me that like the Green Party is like, once I said all the weapons, you know. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2732.0s)]
*  Also interesting asserts, particularly the strange bedfellows in the White House last week in the Oval Office with Joe Biden is Georgia Maloney, the one time Mussolini fan turned prime minister of Italy, who's I don't know, pretty good on Ukraine policy policy, surprisingly. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2738.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I'm just going to mention that clip you sent me about the Georgia on my mind or something. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2755.0s)]
*  Yeah, they start. So Biden's like we played Ray Charles, Georgia on my mind, I think, when she walked in or something. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2761.0s)]
*  And she was just like, I'm sorry. Yeah, I was trying to imagine her face. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2769.0s)]
*  But look, I'll say like, clearly, clearly what he's doing is two things like he's trying to shore up the Ukraine coalition. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2772.0s)]
*  But also, like, I think what they've been trying to do is have like right wing Europeans to because that might be better with MAGA people, you know. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2777.0s)]
*  So they they had, you know, and some of it, you know, like the Tories they had talking to the Republicans on the Hill. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2786.0s)]
*  Good point. I think Liz Truss probably was involved. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2792.0s)]
*  And so I think this is like a bank shot there. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2795.0s)]
*  I do think we should not put too glossy a sheen around Georgia Maloney. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2798.0s)]
*  Maybe she hasn't bought out the jackboots and she's still supporting Ukraine. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2807.0s)]
*  But like there's some pretty harsh stuff happening in Italy related to basically vulnerable people, immigrants, LGBT community. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2811.0s)]
*  You know, so I don't know. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2820.0s)]
*  There's a real pull to care. I understand. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2823.0s)]
*  But like I hope that we temper our affinity in this case. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2825.0s)]
*  Totally with you there. Let's use a little good news again for buddies in France. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2829.0s)]
*  So France will become the first country in the world to enshrine the right to an abortion into its constitution. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2835.0s)]
*  A joint session of parliament overwhelmingly approved the measure with a vote of seven hundred and eighty to seventy two. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2841.0s)]
*  I can't believe they have that many people in parliament and the event culminated in a longstanding ovation in the chamber. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2847.0s)]
*  The reminder part of the reason this is happening is it was a direct response to the U.S. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2852.0s)]
*  Supreme Court overturning Roe versus Wade in the Dab's decision. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2856.0s)]
*  Congratulations, Supreme Court, for getting that done. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2859.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2863.0s)]
*  Brett Kavanaugh, inspiring the French. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2865.0s)]
*  A French senator who filed the amendment in the first place, a woman named Melanie Vogel said, quote, [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2868.0s)]
*  I was inspired by the fact that in the U.S. abortion rights were not in the Constitution. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2872.0s)]
*  Reproductive and sexual rights are shrinking in the world. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2876.0s)]
*  And here today we want to show that this is not the only path that you can follow. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2878.0s)]
*  It can be reversed. So I am very happy for our friends in France for getting this done. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2882.0s)]
*  But also, once again, embarrassed by the ridiculous backwards reactionary path that U.S. politics is on because it's abortion rights. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2888.0s)]
*  Now states are coming from contraception. They're coming for IVF. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2896.0s)]
*  The list goes on and on. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2899.0s)]
*  Yeah, it just is embarrassing. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2901.0s)]
*  I think the one thing to watch, Tommy, is whether this spreads to other European countries, which it might. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2903.0s)]
*  I know some people who are kind of campaigners in this space. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2909.0s)]
*  And when the French, a big player in Europe, obviously makes this move. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2911.0s)]
*  And by the way, like a heavily Catholic, well, in the history of this country, I think you might see similar moves in other European countries. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2917.0s)]
*  And I hope there are. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2927.0s)]
*  I hope there is effort of codifying it constitutionally is powerful. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2928.0s)]
*  I mean, shit, we thought we'd done that here with the 14th Amendment. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2931.0s)]
*  I guess we hadn't. So we have to go back at it. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2935.0s)]
*  But you hope this is contagious. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2937.0s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. And it's a powerful way to motivate your base and get people out. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2939.0s)]
*  Let's talk about Russia because Alexei Navalny's funeral was held last Friday, March 1st in Moscow, [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2943.0s)]
*  two weeks after he was pronounced dead by prison authorities for what they said were natural causes. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2949.0s)]
*  But everyone, including President Biden, assumes was a state sanctioned murder. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2954.0s)]
*  Despite the atmosphere of fear of warnings from the Kremlin that people could face arrests, the heavy police presence, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2958.0s)]
*  thousands of people came out to publicly mourn Navalny. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2966.0s)]
*  They stood in line for hours to lay flowers at his grave, and they kept doing so for days after. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2969.0s)]
*  There are these really unbelievable pictures showing where he was buried that now looks like it's just completely covered in a gigantic mound of flowers several feet tall. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2974.0s)]
*  During the funeral on Friday, a report said you could hear chants of No to War and other Navalny slogans, which is incredibly brave in Russia. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2983.0s)]
*  Navalny's wife and children could not be there because it's frankly just too dangerous for them to travel back to Russia. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2990.0s)]
*  But his widow posted a message on Twitter thanking people for coming out writing, [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2995.0s)]
*  Many people wonder why Alexei fought so hard and never gave up. For your sake, for the beautiful, brave and honest people who now come in an endless queue to say goodbye to him, thank you. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=2999.0s)]
*  This is the true love of the people. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3008.0s)]
*  According to a human rights monitoring group, over 100 people were detained across the country at events paying tribute to Navalny. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3010.0s)]
*  But overall, these events went on pretty peacefully. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3017.0s)]
*  Ben, I mean, we were sort of all texting about this at the end of last week. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3020.0s)]
*  The crowds were shocking to me. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3026.0s)]
*  They were surprisingly moving, given the obvious risk to anybody who attends these events and knowing that you're probably getting picked up on, if not that day, on some sort of video camera. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3030.0s)]
*  Now you've been ID'd for the future. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3040.0s)]
*  But what did you make of the turnout and what it might say about the enduring strength of the Navalny movement? [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3042.0s)]
*  Well, it's interesting. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3047.0s)]
*  Well, it's interesting. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3048.0s)]
*  I recall for me, you know, I did that podcast with Zhanna Nemsova, whose father, Boris Nemsov, was the other prominent oppositionist, literally assassinated by Putin. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3049.0s)]
*  And we, you know, I remembered that one of the episodes of the show was basically about after Nemsov was assassinated, Zhanna started to notice this mountain of flowers started to build at the site of his assassination. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3058.0s)]
*  And this was not even around a funeral. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3072.0s)]
*  This is just people being like, you know what, like, fuck this. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3074.0s)]
*  And it was an enormous mountain of flowers. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3077.0s)]
*  And the reason I tell that story is not to plug the podcast. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3079.0s)]
*  I mean, people have already heard me do that. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3083.0s)]
*  It's because I think we make a mistake sometimes, you know, every now and then there'll be like a public opinion poll from Russia and it'll be like Putin is wildly popular. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3085.0s)]
*  I don't think there's any way to really measure public opinion in a gangster police state, you know. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3096.0s)]
*  And this is a sign that there are, because for every, I was incredibly moved like you were, Tommy, that there were thousands of people being seen in public and knowing that their face is being recorded by facial recognition technology that was probably going to be held against them, you know, for the near future. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3103.0s)]
*  If that many people are willing to take that risk, to me that suggests that there's like probably 10 other people for each one of those people that feel the same way but are just like, yeah, I'm not really willing to go down there. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3125.0s)]
*  So to me, it's not just about the incredible bravery of those people and what a testament that is to Alexei Navalny. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3135.0s)]
*  It's a sign that there's an even bigger political opposition. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3140.0s)]
*  And they may be people that are, you know, like maybe they, we tend to think of as binary. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3144.0s)]
*  They like hate Putin and love Navalny. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3148.0s)]
*  There are people that might be like Putin adjacent, but they're like, you know what, Navalny was right. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3150.0s)]
*  Like this is fucked up. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3155.0s)]
*  Yeah, we killed the guy. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3156.0s)]
*  Yeah, we killed the guy and that's wrong. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3157.0s)]
*  And so I think it's a sign. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3158.0s)]
*  We should be reminded that there are Russians that oppose this, this being the war and Putinism and everything. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3160.0s)]
*  And it's probably bigger than we think it is. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3166.0s)]
*  And that you don't know what the thing is that's going to remove the Jenga piece that kind of breaks the fear factor that allows more of those people to come out. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3169.0s)]
*  But something could happen. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3176.0s)]
*  I mean, the reason Putin killed them is for that reason. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3177.0s)]
*  It's because he knew that he had a base of support in this country and it's going to endure, by the way. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3179.0s)]
*  I think he will be, you know, they'll be in Alexei Navalny Square one day. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3184.0s)]
*  You know, that's kind of what I took away from it. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3188.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, obviously the events were in Moscow and a lot of the reporting was out of Moscow. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3190.0s)]
*  And it talked about how people felt a sense of solidarity and togetherness and, I don't know, just content being together. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3194.0s)]
*  But I think one of the strengths of Navalny was his ability and willingness to get outside of Moscow and travel to all 11 time zones. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3200.0s)]
*  And appeal to people in more rural communities and build support there. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3206.0s)]
*  So, yeah, I think you're right. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3209.0s)]
*  Probably an indication of a much broader and deeper sense of support for Navalny. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3211.0s)]
*  Well, some of the most moving anecdotal reporting was people that had traveled long distances to be there. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3215.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3220.0s)]
*  You know, like Siberia. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3221.0s)]
*  I mean, the guy had a national base, not just in Moscow. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3222.0s)]
*  Yeah, he did. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3224.0s)]
*  A couple of things for the interview. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3225.0s)]
*  So just a quick public service address for members of the Air Force who have access to classified information and are tempted to share it. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3227.0s)]
*  People outside of the organization do not. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3235.0s)]
*  Two reasons why, Ben. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3237.0s)]
*  First, so the Massachusetts Air National Guard member, Jack Tashara, the so-called Discord leaker that we talked so much about a while back, pleaded guilty on Monday and will be sentenced to between 11 and 17 years in prison. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3239.0s)]
*  So not worth it to shitpost on Discord if you get 11 to 17 years in prison. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3252.0s)]
*  It was good content for this podcast. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3258.0s)]
*  It was in for the Washington Post. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3260.0s)]
*  For a few weeks, yeah. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3261.0s)]
*  But yeah, no, I mean, in all seriousness. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3262.0s)]
*  There are consequences that people sometimes can forget that, you know, we try to impress their friends and stuff. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3264.0s)]
*  By the way, it also shows that like, you know, Trump is going to be facing prosecution and, you know, for the same kind of thing. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3271.0s)]
*  He didn't post it on Discord, but he actually posted some of this stuff on social media. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3280.0s)]
*  Yeah, he did. Back in the day. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3284.0s)]
*  Back in the day. So anyway, hopefully there's not two standards of justice in this country, but count me as concerned. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3285.0s)]
*  So also this week, we learned that another Air Force employee has been arrested for leaking classified information online. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3290.0s)]
*  This was a 63-year-old guy named David Franklin Slater. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3295.0s)]
*  He was working as a civilian employee at U.S. Strategic Command. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3299.0s)]
*  So this guy previously had spent 30 years, more than 30 years, in the Army and the Army Reserve. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3302.0s)]
*  He had a top secret clearance. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3308.0s)]
*  He attended classified briefings on the war in Ukraine from February through April of 2022. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3310.0s)]
*  And then he shared classified information from the briefings via email and via like an online messaging service with a quote, [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3316.0s)]
*  women living in Ukraine that he met on a dating site. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3325.0s)]
*  Here are some of the messages from this woman in Ukraine in air quotes that were sent to him. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3328.0s)]
*  Dear, by somebody who looks like Klitschko. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3335.0s)]
*  Dear, what is shown on the screen in the special room? It is very interesting. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3338.0s)]
*  That's one quote. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3342.0s)]
*  Second one. You are the first to tell me that NATO members are traveling by train and only now, early evening, this was announced on our news. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3344.0s)]
*  You are my secret informant, love. How are your meetings? Successfully? [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3350.0s)]
*  Beloved Dave, do NATO and Biden have a secret plan to help us? [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3354.0s)]
*  Dave, it's great that you get information about redacted country first. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3357.0s)]
*  I hope you'll tell me right away. You are my secret agent. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3361.0s)]
*  Sweet Dave, the supply of weapons is completely classified, which is great. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3364.0s)]
*  The list goes on and on. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3369.0s)]
*  Ben, what are the odds that this Air Force employee with top secret clearance met an actual woman in Ukraine who is very interested in NATO capabilities? [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3370.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3380.0s)]
*  Where you put that at zero to 100. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3381.0s)]
*  Yeah. The first takeaway is just it's kind of sad. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3382.0s)]
*  You know, like Dave is probably like send pics or something, you know, and it's just like every, every time that there's one of these things, you're reminded there's like a human dynamic. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3388.0s)]
*  Like the to share a guy was kind of trying to impress showing up as gamer buddies, gamer buddies. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3398.0s)]
*  You think you fucking beat me at Call of Duty? Well, check this out. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3403.0s)]
*  You know, and this is like it's sad. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3407.0s)]
*  It's like an older dude. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3409.0s)]
*  We could all end up, you know, like hopefully we won't end up on a dating site in our sixties with secret agents. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3411.0s)]
*  You know, the other thing that reminds you of two that I, you know, that people forget is it oftentimes like some of the more aggressive. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3417.0s)]
*  Intelligence collectors on the U.S. government are friends. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3426.0s)]
*  Like, you know, when we were, I don't know. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3429.0s)]
*  Oh, yes. Friendly government. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3432.0s)]
*  It's like revealing that much. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3433.0s)]
*  But like, well, let's just say Israel, for instance, is a healthy consumer and collector or France has a reputation. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3435.0s)]
*  You know, like it's not just the Russians and Chinese that are trying to figure out what the U.S. is doing. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3441.0s)]
*  It's it's also your friends. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3446.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3448.0s)]
*  And if I'm the Ukrainians, I would fucking do it. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3449.0s)]
*  I'd be like, I'd create a dating. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3451.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'd create a bunch of Tinder profiles and find some lonely contractors and be like, hey, guys, you want to share some classified information? [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3453.0s)]
*  Yeah. Or just some, you know, FSB person trolling. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3458.0s)]
*  But I do love it. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3461.0s)]
*  Like, well, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3462.0s)]
*  Dave, it makes me so hot when you talk about Naval assets in the Indo-Pacific. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3464.0s)]
*  More likely. More. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3468.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's more likely like some troll farm being like, you know, got one. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3469.0s)]
*  Actually makes you wonder how many Russian accounts are on dating sites and stuff. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3473.0s)]
*  Probably. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3478.0s)]
*  This would be an interesting plot line for like a spy show. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3480.0s)]
*  I might need to. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3483.0s)]
*  The creativity of spy services is impressive. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3484.0s)]
*  Remember, there was a big scandal. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3486.0s)]
*  There was a running app called Strava where basically you could track your jogs and a bunch of like U.S. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3488.0s)]
*  service members serving on like secret bases in Syria or whatever would jog the perimeter of these Ford operating bases that they were not supposed to be known to be at. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3496.0s)]
*  And it would publicly post and people were able to find them. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3505.0s)]
*  Right. Like also this is this frontier of getting on Discord and getting information is fascinating. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3508.0s)]
*  The date like the honey trap is the oldest Intel play in the book. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3513.0s)]
*  Yeah. Of course they're going to take it online. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3516.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, like like all of you know that all of that has moved online. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3518.0s)]
*  Why not? [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3523.0s)]
*  Like that's interesting about the runners. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3524.0s)]
*  I had a friend who was clearly not one of these people responsible, but who told me that like running on the airstrip that you're in in eastern Syria is like basically the only way to be outside and get exercise. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3526.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3536.0s)]
*  My map, my run app though, I'd probably have to disable. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3537.0s)]
*  You might not want it to publicly post to Facebook or whatever the default is, but you know. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3540.0s)]
*  Or the reality is, and again this shows you the depth of the spy craft is like I bet even if you didn't post to the app, like they're collecting any like if your iPhone is. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3546.0s)]
*  Well, if you have an iPhone like they're probably in it. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3559.0s)]
*  And so you don't even have to be using the app for them to be able to trace your, you know, I mean this is the degree to which our we don't realize how much we leave an online footprint to a country like Russia that wants to know about it. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3561.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3572.0s)]
*  Dave. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3573.0s)]
*  Dave. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3574.0s)]
*  Your. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3575.0s)]
*  Dave just. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3576.0s)]
*  Your Poland based interceptor missiles. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3577.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3579.0s)]
*  So sexy. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3580.0s)]
*  Not great. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3581.0s)]
*  Poor Dave. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3582.0s)]
*  Good luck Dave. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3583.0s)]
*  Hope you hire a good lawyer. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3584.0s)]
*  Finally, Ben. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3585.0s)]
*  We talked a few times about Tucker Carlson's visit to Moscow, his interview with Vladimir Putin. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3586.0s)]
*  Putin then saying he was disappointed in the interview. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3591.0s)]
*  His Tucker's questions were so soft. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3594.0s)]
*  Tucker's excitement about the metro and the grocery store. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3596.0s)]
*  So Tucker did an interview of sorts with a podcaster named Lex Friedman about the Putin interview. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3600.0s)]
*  This clip caught our eye. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3608.0s)]
*  What do you think of Putin saying that justification for continuing the war is denazification? [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3610.0s)]
*  I thought it was one of the dumbest things I'd ever heard. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3615.0s)]
*  I didn't understand what it meant. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3617.0s)]
*  Denazification? [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3619.0s)]
*  It literally means what it sounds like. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3620.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3624.0s)]
*  I mean, I have a lot of thoughts on this. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3625.0s)]
*  I don't, I hate that whole conversation because it's not real. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3628.0s)]
*  It's just ad hominem. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3631.0s)]
*  It's a way of associating someone with an evil regime that doesn't exist anymore. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3632.0s)]
*  I just, it literally means what it sounds like. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3636.0s)]
*  It's so funny. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3640.0s)]
*  And Tucker, it's not the first time Putin's ever mentioned denazification. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3641.0s)]
*  So they won. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3645.0s)]
*  And Tucker's ability to sound incredulous about anything. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3646.0s)]
*  When he knows he didn't challenge Putin when he said that. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3650.0s)]
*  He didn't in his hagiography of Russians, Metro, he didn't say, oh, and by the way, what they said about denazification is bullshit. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3653.0s)]
*  He's weirdly swerving in a defensive direction on this stuff. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3661.0s)]
*  But sounding incredulous at things that he was literally being a propagandist for a few weeks ago. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3666.0s)]
*  I love it. I love it. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3672.0s)]
*  Great timing, Tucker. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3673.0s)]
*  Great interview. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3674.0s)]
*  Okay. That's it for the show, but stick around and you will hear my interview with Haloud Hare. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3675.0s)]
*  She's a Sudanese political analyst and the founding director of a think tank that used to be based in Khartoum. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3680.0s)]
*  We're going to talk about the civil war in Sudan, what the international community could be doing to stop it, and much, much more. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3685.0s)]
*  So check that out. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3691.0s)]
*  It has now been almost a year since Sudan spiraled into a civil war between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the paramilitary group known as the RSF. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3692.0s)]
*  Joining me to talk through all of this and what's happening is Haloud Hare, a Sudanese political analyst and the founding director of the Confluence Advisory, a think and do tank formerly based in Khartoum. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3699.0s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining the show. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3709.0s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3710.0s)]
*  Let's just start with the basics. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3712.0s)]
*  Can you give us a sense of the backstory about how things devolved between these two warring parties, these two warring generals, and spiraled into this massive civil war? [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3713.0s)]
*  Sure. Both Burhan, who is the head of the Sudanese Armed Forces, and Hemeti, who is the head of the Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, both of them were sort of working together for quite some time during the Darfur Genocide of 2003 to 2005. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3723.0s)]
*  They were working hand and fisted glove, and they forged a relationship, a very strong working relationship at that time. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3740.0s)]
*  And they both were integral in their personal capacities, but also in sort of within their institutions. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3747.0s)]
*  For Bashir, General Bashir, Sudan's 30-year dictator, who had used this coup-proofing method of engendering different elements and different strands of his security network to be very much loyal to him, but somewhat in opposition to each other so they couldn't club together and usurp him. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3753.0s)]
*  And so they were sort of in relative competition. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3777.0s)]
*  But then in 2018-2019, when a popular protest broke out and a revolution started in Sudan, that was Sudan's third revolution since independence, against Bashir, they spied an opportunity to claim that power for themselves. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3781.0s)]
*  And so they both helped unseat Bashir. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3797.0s)]
*  In fact, we believe Hemeti was the one to personally arrest him. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3799.0s)]
*  And then they positioned themselves as sort of the saviors of the country. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3803.0s)]
*  And together they ruled alongside a civilian government for a short period of a short transitional period. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3807.0s)]
*  But there came a point where both of them realized that they wanted to take the whole cake for themselves. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3814.0s)]
*  And so together they worked to sort of set up a coup against the civilian cabinet of Dr. Abdullah Hamduq. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3819.0s)]
*  And there really started the differences between them to come to the fore. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3829.0s)]
*  We saw them cultivate different income streams, particularly around gold and other national resources. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3835.0s)]
*  We saw them sort of cultivate different foreign policies with one actor going after some in the region and the other sort of pursuing relationships with the others in the region. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3841.0s)]
*  And that really set them on towards confrontation. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3854.0s)]
*  Effectively, the coup they led together in 2021 couldn't serve both of them. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3857.0s)]
*  And in a very sort of Cain and Abel-like story, these former brothers in arms are now fighting each other for effectively total control of the politics and the economy and the future of Sudan. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3862.0s)]
*  And I remember the fighting started in Khartoum and there was a lot of reporting about heavy weaponry being used in the city. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3876.0s)]
*  It quickly spread to the Darfur region. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3883.0s)]
*  It's been hard for me to get a sense of just sort of what the impact has been countrywide. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3885.0s)]
*  I know there's reports that specific tribal groups are being targeted. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3889.0s)]
*  I've seen reports about the RSF going after doctors or medical infrastructure. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3892.0s)]
*  Can you give us a sense of what the humanitarian impact has been just broadly for the people of Sudan? [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3897.0s)]
*  I think it's an understatement to say it's been devastating. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3902.0s)]
*  We have seen the near total collapse of the health sector, which means only a small fraction of hospitals are still functioning. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3906.0s)]
*  We have seen schools almost entirely shut, which means 19 million children out of the 23 million children of Sudan are now currently out. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3914.0s)]
*  And I think that's a conservative estimate. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3923.0s)]
*  We have seen WFP last week reporting that 95 percent of people in Sudan can't afford even one meal a day, which means that the famine that we've all been concerned about is actually upon us. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3926.0s)]
*  The UN has not yet declared a famine in Sudan, which means we're not seeing the requisite response, both financial and political. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3940.0s)]
*  But we can see from reporting on the ground that people are very much suffering the devastating impact of this. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3946.0s)]
*  And as you said, you know, there are also have been the lootings, the sexual assault, the ethnic based atrocities that many aid and human rights groups, such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch have said, [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3953.0s)]
*  could amount to genocide. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3968.0s)]
*  So we've seen an almost total state collapse because, as you say, this conflict did start off in Khartoum. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3971.0s)]
*  And Sudan's conflict is the only conflict in the world today where it is the capital city that was hit first and hit hardest, which means the already crumbling government infrastructure and already crumbling service infrastructure has now practically gone. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3978.0s)]
*  What this means is that, you know, people tearing down the the sort of the barrel of a very long conflict with increasingly deteriorating situation. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=3996.0s)]
*  And actually, considering it's been 10 months of fighting, we have seen already very, very rapid deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Sudan. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4007.0s)]
*  And to add, you know, insult to injury, we're seeing both sides restrict aid and try to capture aid from those people who needed the most in order to divert that aid to their own troops. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4017.0s)]
*  So there are issues with access. There are issues with getting that aid delivered to where it needs to go. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4029.0s)]
*  I think your point that the humanitarian nightmare cannot be overstated was reinforced by a recent report I read in The Washington Post that said the RSF was subjecting women into sexual slavery that they had captured in the fighting. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4034.0s)]
*  So just the worst thing you could ever imagine. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4047.0s)]
*  There have been a number of reports about the United Arab Emirates role in this war, specifically that they've been funneling weapons to the RSF. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4049.0s)]
*  Do we know if these weapons shipments are still happening and have a sense of how important they are to continuing the conflict? [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4057.0s)]
*  According to reporting from the ground, those shipments are still coming in. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4064.0s)]
*  The RSF has just suffered something of a defeat in this twin city of Omdurman, which is a twin city to the capital Khartoum. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4071.0s)]
*  And it has been recruiting and rearming itself in order to launch a counteroffensive. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4080.0s)]
*  The weapons that are coming in from the UAE, as reported by the New York Times and CNN, have been coming in through neighboring countries, through Chad, through Uganda, through Kenya. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4086.0s)]
*  But recently, in the past few months, the RSF has taken over the city of Niala, which is the capital of Sartouk, and that city has an airstrip. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4099.0s)]
*  And it's now believed that much of the traffic coming in, the air traffic coming in, is coming in directly through Niala, which means that the RSF have effectively a way of directly getting weapons from the UAE and elsewhere. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4110.0s)]
*  Wagner is also a supplier of weaponry to the RSF. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4125.0s)]
*  That is the Russian paramilitary group operating in much of Central Africa and the Sahel. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4131.0s)]
*  And so what we're seeing is there's a continuous ramping up of this conflict on both sides. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4136.0s)]
*  Now we're seeing the Sudanese armed forces getting closer to Tehran, and that has resulted in increased weapons supply to the Sudanese armed forces via Port Sudan. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4143.0s)]
*  You mentioned Chad earlier, a neighboring country to Sudan. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4154.0s)]
*  They've obviously had their own internal political challenges the last few years. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4157.0s)]
*  You had a leader killed at the front lines. His son took over, sort of questionable legitimacy. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4162.0s)]
*  But I've also seen reports that refugee flows from Sudan into Chad have been exacerbating the problems and leading to stability. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4166.0s)]
*  Do you have a sense of the ways this conflict in Sudan may or may not be spilling over into the region? [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4175.0s)]
*  The threat of spillover has always been really, really high because Sudan has seven neighbors, all of whom, with the exception of one Eritrea, are undergoing some kind of transition themselves and a very fragile transition at that. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4181.0s)]
*  And various stages of it and the surrounded by countries with which it has very porous borders, which means that weapons flows, for example, from Eritrea can come in easily or indeed from Chad for the RSF, which means also that refugees fleeing the violence in Sudan can also move over to other countries. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4195.0s)]
*  So Chad is currently hosting half a million refugees, Egypt much more than that and other countries such as South Sudan already very much sort of crumbling infrastructure and on the poverty line also hosting many Sudanese refugees. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4216.0s)]
*  So it's quite an unsustainable spillover, I would say. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4230.0s)]
*  And that is just in terms of, you know, sort of initial refugee flows. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4234.0s)]
*  If this conflict lasts much longer, we can expect that, for example, some of the ethnic groups that are shared between Sudan and its neighbors could also be embroiled in the conflict. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4239.0s)]
*  And in fact, with Chad, we're already seeing this something of a non-Arab Darfuri alliance has sprung up between armed movements in Darfur that are from the same ethnic groups as, for example, the Zarawa leadership in Egypt. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4249.0s)]
*  And that is created quite a complex mosaic of problems on that border, but also in the Chadian capital of Injimena and the various state capitals in Darfur. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4268.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you make a good point there. There's been enormous instability regionally, especially with the Ethiopian civil war, the number of coups across the Sahel, etc. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4280.0s)]
*  I know that the United States, Saudi Arabia, some others have been trying to get the RSF and the Sudanese military to sit down, work out a ceasefire agreement. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4288.0s)]
*  Those talks have failed repeatedly. Do we know why they keep failing? [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4297.0s)]
*  Yes, it's very simple. You can't have two actors out of myriad actors that have invested interest in Sudan sit down at the table and effectively ask, merely ask, the two sides to sign a ceasefire agreement. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4300.0s)]
*  That's not how you get a ceasefire signed and sort of committed to, let alone a lasting one. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4317.0s)]
*  And that's exactly what we saw with the Jeddah talks led by the US and Saudi. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4323.0s)]
*  There was initial resistance to getting the Egyptians, who support the Sudanese armed forces to various extents, and the United Arab Emirates that supports the RSF, to also join that mediation platform. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4328.0s)]
*  And if you don't make the sort of central backers of the two sides part of the solution, they are of course going to continue to be part of the problem. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4340.0s)]
*  And so there has been some level of evolution from the Jeddah talk format, which relied basically on only two sort of guarantors, the US and Saudi, but also did not bring any real leverage to the table against the two sides, particularly economic leverage. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4348.0s)]
*  There has been some evolution from that in recent talks held in the Bahraini capital of Manama. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4366.0s)]
*  But those talks, even though they sort of brought in different regional actors like Egypt, Qatar, the UAE and Saudi, as well as of course the host Bahrain, and they brought in the deputies not asking for Burhan al-Himmati to come in, which is of course going to be very difficult. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4371.0s)]
*  But this was an effort mostly led by the intelligence departments of those different countries, not the diplomatic core, which means that what you're going to get effectively out of such talks is sort of some kind of power sharing deal between the belligerents that leaves very little room for civilian engagement and very little room for democratic dispensation. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4389.0s)]
*  So what more do you think the international community should be doing or needs to do? [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4411.0s)]
*  And do folks feel like this issue is just not being focused on because of Gaza, because of Ukraine, because the world is distracted? [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4416.0s)]
*  I mean, I think it's sort of a cop out to say the world is distracted because I think the world should be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4424.0s)]
*  And in fact, it has done so before when there was a lot of focus on Darfur in the early aughts. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4432.0s)]
*  It was the war on terror time and a lot of the media as well as policy attention was on that. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4440.0s)]
*  And yet, for example, the Bush administration at the time found time to dedicate to Darfur appointing an envoy as such and sort of pushing for different sort of political diplomatic measures economically funding those measures and those initiatives to make sure that Darfur had the requisite focus. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4446.0s)]
*  That is now completely gone. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4469.0s)]
*  So, you know, Gaza and Ukraine are, of course, taking a lot of attention as they should. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4471.0s)]
*  They are, you know, quite big conflicts. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4476.0s)]
*  But that doesn't mean I think that there should be no attention on Sudan as we have seen. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4479.0s)]
*  It's been, you know, commensurate to the level of devastation we've seen the prospect of state collapse, the spillover effects. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4484.0s)]
*  There's very little media attention on. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4493.0s)]
*  So one thing that I think the international community needs to do and you know, you have to use that term lightly. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4495.0s)]
*  You know, the international community is very many actors with very, very different, often diverging interests. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4501.0s)]
*  You know, what the UAE wants in the in Sudan is not what the US wants in Sudan. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4506.0s)]
*  But I think there's a there's a need to bring in this very diverse and very divergent mediation efforts that have taken place. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4511.0s)]
*  You know, you have the neighboring countries initiative led by Cairo. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4519.0s)]
*  We've just mentioned and talked about the JEDDA initiative led by the US and Saudi. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4522.0s)]
*  You have the AU, which is recently put as African Union, put together a panel of three experts. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4526.0s)]
*  But to me, it seems as if they're sort of farming out this Sudan file on those experts so that they could concentrate on their own elections this year. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4533.0s)]
*  Of course, that is also the case in the UK and the US, where it's an election year. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4542.0s)]
*  You have the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, which has had a sort of heads of state initiative that it was leading. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4545.0s)]
*  Also, again, very much divorced from the other initiatives. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4552.0s)]
*  And now more recently, you have the Manama talks that I mentioned just now. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4555.0s)]
*  And none of these are working together in any kind of coherent or concerted way, which means, you know, the prospect of forum shopping is very high. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4559.0s)]
*  If you are one of the belligerent parties, you can just ice out one of those mediations and go to the one that you think will give you what you want. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4569.0s)]
*  And that's been happening in Sudan's history for a long time and should have been anticipated. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4575.0s)]
*  Yeah. To your point, I mean, the Bush administration was at the height of the Iraq War. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4581.0s)]
*  The Afghanistan war was raging. It was recently after 9-11. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4587.0s)]
*  They were able to focus on what was happening in Darfur. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4590.0s)]
*  And that was in part, I think, due to political pressure from this large international movement called Save Darfur that raised awareness about the atrocities that were happening, that demanded intervention or at least some sort of diplomatic action. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4593.0s)]
*  Is there any similar non-governmental effort being marshaled that you've seen that people can support or aid organizations or groups that are advocating on behalf of more action to help people in Sudan? [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4607.0s)]
*  There are, but I would say nowhere near the level we saw during the Save Darfur movement. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4620.0s)]
*  And I think what's interesting about the Save Darfur movement is that actually many of those, you know, celebrities, academics, researchers who were active during the Save Darfur period are, you know, they're still very much around. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4626.0s)]
*  But the level of focus and attention just isn't there. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4640.0s)]
*  Save Darfur, I think, was very much a product of its time. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4643.0s)]
*  But what people have relied on, you know, in the absence of the kind of Save Darfur setup is social media. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4648.0s)]
*  So there have been campaigns that have been launched on Twitter, on Instagram, you know, trying to raise attention, mostly led by Sudanese activists or Sudanese actors, either in Sudan or in the diaspora, for trying to raise attention on this. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4656.0s)]
*  But of course, that's not going to be enough of a critical mass to be able to get attention on this in the same way. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4671.0s)]
*  So there are also NGOs, for example, like Crisis Action, which is US based, and a few others in the UK, mostly outside of the country and outside of the region. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4677.0s)]
*  There's Africans with the Horn of Africa, a group of lawyers, as the name suggests, in the Horn of Africa, who are trying to raise attention on this. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4688.0s)]
*  But, you know, these are all, again, very disparate efforts, much like the mediations. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4696.0s)]
*  And there's no, there's no, currently there's no, you know, sort of center of gravity for a lot of those efforts. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4700.0s)]
*  And I think one thing that would improve that is if they felt, if there was some kind of impact on the policy space, if there was an entity, doesn't have to be a government, that was able to say, OK, we will now put a lot of focus on this in the same fashion as Save Darfur, [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4706.0s)]
*  and be able to propel this this issue at the global stage. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4722.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's really well said. I do think it would probably be helpful. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4726.0s)]
*  You know, people who are listening to the show right now could call their congressmen, their senators, and say, we want more focus to be put on what's happening in Sudan. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4728.0s)]
*  You can call the White House. You can call the State Department and say, you know, we need more pressure from an envoy. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4737.0s)]
*  We need to consider, you know, a carrot and stick approach. We need to consider pressure on the UAE to stop the arms transfers. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4741.0s)]
*  I mean, these are supposed to be our closest allies. People in Washington go to fancy dinner parties with the the, you know, ambassador from the Emirates all day long. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4747.0s)]
*  They hang out at Cafe Milano. Yeah. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4755.0s)]
*  So, you know, maybe let them know that you're not thrilled with funneling arms into a civil war if you're listening and you see the guy. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4757.0s)]
*  Absolutely. I mean, the thing about the U.S. government is that, you know, we're seeing different levels of efforts and different levels of focus from different the different branches of the U.S. government. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4764.0s)]
*  So, you know, from the Hill, for example, we have seen far more attention and far better attention, the right type of attention on Sudan, you know, sort of privileging the need to engage civilians, privileging the need to engage with the belligerence and more in a sort of a stick fashion rather than the carrot fashion, which the State Department seems to prefer. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4773.0s)]
*  And then conversely, we see the State Department actually has much more of a sort of gently, gently hand holding approach to the generals, which arguably it has always had certainly since since the coup, where it actually failed to even characterize the coup as such. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4797.0s)]
*  And I think this sent a signal to the generals in Khartoum that effectively they could get away with quite a lot. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4811.0s)]
*  Whereas with the White House, we're not getting any attention at all. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4818.0s)]
*  Just recently, there was a special envoy that was appointed, Tom Pereira, I believe he started yesterday or Monday, and he seems to have, you know, sort of the right energy, the right characteristics as a politician to really understand the nuances of what's going on in Sudan. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4821.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's a really good point. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4837.0s)]
*  Well, listen, thank you so much for for talk with me through all of this and explaining what's going on and for all your work and advocacy. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4862.0s)]
*  It's really important. And, you know, maybe we'll get Tom Perriello on soon. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4868.0s)]
*  He's we should actually I met him back in the day. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4872.0s)]
*  He was a congressman during the early Obama days and took a courageous vote for health care that lost him his seat. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4874.0s)]
*  But, you know, sort of says a lot about his character. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4880.0s)]
*  Absolutely. And that's exactly the kind of character I think you need for this, because his role primarily would be to corral all these different actors, particularly in the mediation space to get them to work towards a common goal and build some consensus. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4882.0s)]
*  And I think, you know, a politician, maybe more than a diplomat is well positioned to do that. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4895.0s)]
*  Yeah, very well said. Well, listen, thank you so much and talk soon. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4899.0s)]
*  Thanks again to Haloud here for joining the show. Good luck at the State of the Union, Ben. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4903.0s)]
*  Glad I'm not working on this one. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4907.0s)]
*  Come on. Throw in a couple of lines to the crew over there. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4909.0s)]
*  Well, I think our AI teed up a few because they've got infrastructure bill, you know, so that's true. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4913.0s)]
*  Just as we are rebuilding roads and bridges in swing states. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4920.0s)]
*  So, too, are we rebuilding democracy? [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4924.0s)]
*  Democracy. I like it. Yeah, yeah, that works. Sure. Sure. We'll do that. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4930.0s)]
*  Rebuilding the Ukrainian economy. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4933.0s)]
*  So I'm not saying it's going to. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4936.0s)]
*  They'll spend like a thousand hours on the speech and then some like idiot mega member of Congress will shout you lie in the middle of it. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4938.0s)]
*  And that'll be all we talk about. Yeah, that'll be fun. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4944.0s)]
*  There's a possibility that like from the from Keefe to Kentucky enters into the speech. Oh, yeah. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4946.0s)]
*  There was a big bridge to Kentucky, right? Yeah. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4951.0s)]
*  And there's like a Democratic governor there. Maybe there's some democracy. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4953.0s)]
*  We'll be sure to call. Great idea. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4956.0s)]
*  OK, well, we'll we'll check in next week and we'll let you guys know what our favorite transition sentence. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4959.0s)]
*  Yes. From the speech and talk to you soon. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4964.0s)]
*  Let's do it. What are we doing? Yes. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4966.0s)]
*  We know you may be feeling a little stressed about politics right now. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4969.0s)]
*  So we wanted to offer a practical, hopeful guide to make sure that you're ready for the 2024 election and the 2025 insurrection. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4971.0s)]
*  That's why we wrote a book called Democracy or Else, How to Save America in 10 Easy Steps. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4980.0s)]
*  It's a helpful illustrated guide with 100 percent perfect jokes. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4985.0s)]
*  But maybe reading isn't your thing. Maybe the lore of a reasonable page count loaded with illustrations isn't enough to move the needle. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4988.0s)]
*  That's fine. That's right. We hunkered down for what was, let's be honest, a tedious eight hours. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4993.0s)]
*  We'll never get back to bring you democracy or else as an audiobook. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=4997.0s)]
*  Finally, your chance to listen to the three of us talk about politics. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=5001.0s)]
*  What a rare opportunity. Perfect for the avid listener who loves the pod, but just wishes it was much, much longer. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=5005.0s)]
*  And people who don't read like me. Right. Yeah. Illiterate. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=5009.0s)]
*  I like to listen to things. Functionally illiterate people. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=5012.0s)]
*  We're really selling it. So. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=5016.0s)]
*  Boy am I going to click. Hey, don't break your phone's clicking purchase. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=5020.0s)]
*  It's actually great. Every Republican that gets some ghostwriter to throw a couple of words on a page is on the bestseller list. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=5025.0s)]
*  Why can't it be us? Why not us? Yeah. Why is it always Bill O'Reilly? Yeah. Some historical figure. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUB0chOfiU&t=5030.0s)]
