Video Description: Ben and Tommy discuss an Israeli airstrike on an Iranian embassy building in Syria that killed several top Iranian generals, Israeli drone strikes that killed seven World Central Kitchen humanitarian relief workers in Gaza and what they tell us about Israel’s lack of concern about civilian causalities, and growing protests in Israel against Netanyahu. Then they talk about Trump’s “shadow Secretary of State” Ric Grenell, the Qataris investing in Newsmax, a 60 Minutes report blaming Russia for “Havana Syndrome”, and one year since Russia arrested WSJ reporter Evan Gershkovich. Finally, they cover a new anti-hate speech law in Scotland, the barring of an opposition candidate in Venezuela, Chinese disinformation promoting Trump in the US, a big loss for Erdogan’s party in Turkey’s local elections, and Reagan’s almost assassin complaining about cancel culture.

*  Yeah, let's do it. I want to be in that like a end-of-the-year list of yeah, I want to be right [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=134.92000000000002s)]
*  I see that's what I'm talking about. That's right. All right, man [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=140.96s)]
*  Let's start with this Israeli strike in Iran because on Monday the Israeli military bombed an Iranian embassy building in Syria [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=144.62s)]
*  Killing three top Iranian generals and four other Iranian officers [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=152.24s)]
*  So these were top guys from Iran's Quds Force [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=155.68s)]
*  Which is the branch of their military that focuses on intelligence and unconventional warfare [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=159.16s)]
*  Especially the relationship with terrorist groups in the Middle East [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=164.32s)]
*  One of the Iranian generals killed was reportedly in charge of Iran's military relationship with Syria and Lebanon [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=167.92s)]
*  So a senior guy with a big account [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=173.8s)]
*  According to the New York Times these generals are meeting with leaders from the organization [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=176.68s)]
*  Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which is an extremist group in Gaza that gets funding from Iran has launched [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=181.08s)]
*  You know missile attacks on Israel was a part of October 7 [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=187.48s)]
*  That would certainly explain why Israel might want to take this strike [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=191.39999999999998s)]
*  But you know Iran's leaders not surprisingly are furious the supreme leader vowed revenge [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=196.0s)]
*  President Raisi said the attack was a violation of international law [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=202.6s)]
*  I assume he's referring to the fact that this was a diplomatic facility that was targeted [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=205.56s)]
*  Israel says actually no the building was an IRGC [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=210.39999999999998s)]
*  Facility not a diplomatic facility [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=214.32s)]
*  But boy, you know targeting a building like that in a foreign capital is a dangerous precedent in my view anyway, Ben [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=216.2s)]
*  So Iran's foreign minister also made clear that Iran blames the US as much as Israel for the strike [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=222.39999999999998s)]
*  Even if we weren't part of it, which is what the White House has said [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=227.44s)]
*  But you know, the missile was fired from an f-35 which is an American plane. So I'm sure they will blame us as well [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=230.32s)]
*  This is the biggest assassination of a top Iranian official since the US killed the head of the IRGC [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=235.76s)]
*  Cosmo Soleimani back in 2020 [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=241.6s)]
*  So Ben stepping back Iran and Israel have been engaging in these kind of low-grade [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=243.39999999999998s)]
*  Attacks of this warfare for years now [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=249.2s)]
*  a lot of it comes in the form of these kinds of Israeli strikes in Syria or [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=251.39999999999998s)]
*  Hezbollah shelling Israeli targets from Lebanon firing into Israel [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=257.15999999999997s)]
*  But you know killing a bunch of generals in Damascus is a major escalation. What did you make of? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=261.91999999999996s)]
*  Israel's decision to take this shot and like what are you expecting in terms of a retaliation because remember the Soleimani strike [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=267.48s)]
*  After that Iran fired a dozen ballistic missiles directly at US bases in Iraq [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=275.92s)]
*  Giving 100 US service members traumatic brain injury. So it was not an insignificant response [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=281.20000000000005s)]
*  Well, you've seen more Israeli strikes in Syria recently and I think they must really be going at the supply chain [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=286.34000000000003s)]
*  I think the IRGC uses Syria's kind of a hub to supply Hezbollah [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=291.96s)]
*  And it seems like if they're meeting with Palestinian Islamic jihad [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=296.68s)]
*  Maybe that is also a node for how they are transferring weapons or cash or whatever [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=299.88s)]
*  But you know, it's a serious risk of escalation because when you take out your senior people like this in the government [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=306.8s)]
*  I think it raises the stakes for Iran to feel like they need to respond [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=312.76s)]
*  And so once again, we're in this place of things escalating without a clear [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=316.76s)]
*  Endstate of what is being pursued. So, I mean I I understand the objective, but I also [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=320.92s)]
*  You know looking at all of this right from Syria down through Lebanon and obviously in Gaza [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=327.15999999999997s)]
*  Which we'll talk about like there's just a lot of escalation without a lot of planes landing [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=332.64s)]
*  I also have to say like [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=337.48s)]
*  it's not a small thing to hit, you know a government building in another country and [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=340.28s)]
*  and and people can you know [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=345.15999999999997s)]
*  Make the point that Iran is using this for nefarious purposes and yet [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=348.28s)]
*  There's a reason that you have international law around these things, you know that [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=352.15999999999997s)]
*  These are protected facilities if they're government buildings and they're their diplomatic facilities. It's technically Iranian [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=356.44s)]
*  territory essentially [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=362.92s)]
*  You know because an embassy or consulate is a part of the sovereign territory of another country and the whole international system kind of depends [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=364.28s)]
*  on on [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=371.2s)]
*  that [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=372.52s)]
*  principle not being violated [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=373.59999999999997s)]
*  so [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=375.52s)]
*  it just again it feels like a common theme that we're gonna be talking about today is [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=376.76s)]
*  the Israeli government really not playing by any rules, you know and [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=382.08s)]
*  And that has a tendency to lead to bad places, you know, that's what I worry about is where does this escalate? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=386.64s)]
*  What precedent is being set? What legal risk is Israel frankly assuming by doing this? I mean, there's a lot of [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=392.8s)]
*  Questions about whether this is worth it [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=399.64s)]
*  I mean [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=402.42s)]
*  Aren't there other ways of trying to get at this problem other than doing something so brazen is blowing up something on kind of the embassy [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=403.54s)]
*  Road there in Damascus. Yeah, I mean listen if these were really were Palestinian Islamic Jihad guys [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=409.9s)]
*  Leaders at this facility I can understand the Israeli motivation if these were IRGC leaders that maybe provided support to Hamas or [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=416.06s)]
*  Hezbollah over the years I can understand why they'd want to target them [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=424.78s)]
*  But just to hammer home your point, I mean imagine if Iran [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=427.98s)]
*  Blew up a US consulate somewhere and said well, it's not really a diplomatic facility [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=431.78000000000003s)]
*  The CIA works out of there and the CIA is the one who does all the armed drone program [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=436.38s)]
*  So it's a it's a it's a legitimate target. I don't think we'd react too well to that [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=440.1s)]
*  Yeah [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=444.54s)]
*  And I think Israel's been pretty careful over the years to do these things in a more discreet way [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=445.06s)]
*  you know and to not announce strikes to you know, they hit some base in the it's more in a [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=451.46000000000004s)]
*  Less densely populated area. This is kind of announcing [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=458.68s)]
*  Hey, we don't care anymore. You know, we're just gonna start blowing up literally [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=463.76s)]
*  Diplomatic facilities we're gonna blow up things in downtown Damascus that everybody can see and that mindset really worries me because it's it's again [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=468.92s)]
*  It's not limited to this strike [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=476.68s)]
*  Across the board we see these really government essentially [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=478.68s)]
*  demonstrating [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=482.71999999999997s)]
*  We don't need to play by these rules anymore and and again, I think that is always a dangerous [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=484.56s)]
*  Tack to take whoever's taking it. I think be bad at the US is doing it, you know [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=489.92s)]
*  Yeah for sure [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=493.8s)]
*  And so let's turn to Gaza because there was this awful strike on a humanitarian convoy [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=494.52s)]
*  Led by World Central Kitchen, which is a humanitarian relief group started by the chef Jose Andres [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=500.44s)]
*  So World Central Kitchen, I'm gonna call it WCK is a little easier. They respond to disasters all over the world. They're in Ukraine [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=505.68s)]
*  They're in Haiti. They're in like 47 countries [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=512.02s)]
*  They're just like doing the Lord's work cooking giant, you know meals for people and helping out folks that are struggling [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=513.98s)]
*  So World Central Kitchen built a jetty out of rubble to get aid into Gaza by sea [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=519.62s)]
*  On Monday World Central Kitchen workers were leaving a warehouse in Gaza in a convoy and the convoy was repeatedly targeted by [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=525.46s)]
*  Israeli missiles so there were seven aid workers killed including a US citizen [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=533.82s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu said this strike was unintentional that there would be an investigation of some sort [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=538.9399999999999s)]
*  But World Central Kitchen said they specifically [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=544.14s)]
*  Coordinated their movements with the IDF with the Israeli government. The cars were clearly marked [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=547.3s)]
*  I mean you can see them now even though there's giant, you know [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=552.3s)]
*  Holes in the roof where the drone hit it [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=555.58s)]
*  But according to haretz this IDF unit responsible for security in the area where this convoy was driving [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=558.06s)]
*  They said they saw some sort of armed guy in a truck that was part of a convoy [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=564.98s)]
*  So that's why they fired at it [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=569.24s)]
*  But it wasn't just one strike the drone hits the first car these passengers are all wounded and like delirious [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=570.66s)]
*  They get out they escape into a second car [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=577.02s)]
*  Then the drone hits that car then those people who are still alive get out and they try to evacuate [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=579.26s)]
*  Wounded people into a third car and then the drone strikes the third car [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=585.1800000000001s)]
*  So again like clearly [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=588.7s)]
*  Apparently the rules of engagement here were that seeing one armed guy in a convoy made it okay to massacre [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=590.7s)]
*  Seven people right so that is insane on its face [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=597.98s)]
*  And I think it's obviously a tragedy for the people who are killed [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=601.18s)]
*  but also this is gonna have consequences for people in Gaza because the AP reported that aid ships carrying [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=604.98s)]
*  240 tons of undelivered aid have now turned back from Gaza [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=610.34s)]
*  World Central Kitchen and other groups are suspending their operations in Gaza's they're not gonna be feeding these starving people anymore and also been [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=613.94s)]
*  It gets at this broader problem that I think we've seen throughout the war [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=621.26s)]
*  Which is that you'll you'll see quotes from Netanyahu and other officials claiming that the IDF is [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=624.54s)]
*  Quote the most moral army in the world because of all these steps they take to to protect civilians [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=629.34s)]
*  But now there are countless examples of the IDF showing almost total disregard for civilians [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=634.54s)]
*  There was a report over the weekend about the idea of having kill zones in Gaza where anyone who crosses like an imaginary line [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=639.9s)]
*  Is treated as a combatant there were the attacks this past week on medical infrastructure like El Shifa Hospital [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=645.9399999999999s)]
*  Which is now just completely destroyed [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=652.8s)]
*  And it's why like you know people like you and me flipped out last week when we read in the Washington Post [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=655.22s)]
*  That the US had transferred more 2,000 pound bombs to Israel because those are the bombs that have been [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=659.86s)]
*  Responsible for many of the worst cat mass casualty incidents in this war so Ben I guess like the my takeaway was [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=666.38s)]
*  just enormous frustration that [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=674.0600000000001s)]
*  the this you know [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=676.6600000000001s)]
*  32,000 people dead in Gaza and now this attack on a humanitarian convoy that kills an American and even that doesn't seem to shake the US [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=679.3000000000001s)]
*  Off its current policy of saying no we got Israel's back. We're gonna send more weapons [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=686.86s)]
*  There are no red lines that have been crossed. We're not gonna cut off military assistance [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=691.98s)]
*  It just seems like there's no change here. Yeah, I mean first of all just on the strike itself [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=695.5s)]
*  Netanyahu said something [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=700.9s)]
*  They really triggered me when he acknowledged the strike, but he said [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=702.9s)]
*  Things like this happen in war. I saw that too [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=706.78s)]
*  They don't the last time I can remember anything like this happening was when the Russian government in the Syrian regime [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=709.7s)]
*  Bombed aid trucks in Aleppo and towards the end of the Obama administration [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=716.7s)]
*  Like that's the company that the Israeli government is putting itself in these trucks were marked [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=720.58s)]
*  They had gone through the deconfliction process where they notify the Israeli government [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=725.5s)]
*  They were literally picking up aid and delivering it right so something horrific happened here [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=729.26s)]
*  I mean even if this was not an intentional strike and I think that has to be [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=735.06s)]
*  Something that is looked at [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=741.34s)]
*  Whatever the nature of this military operation is is not good because we're six months into the war [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=743.98s)]
*  There's no process to deconflict aid trucks that are clearly marked from getting food to people [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=748.58s)]
*  That's the first thing the second thing is as you said because Israel has put on route of business [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=753.34s)]
*  The World Central Kitchen was really stepping up to fill some of this void to deal with famine and now they can't operate because how [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=760.34s)]
*  can you ask them to operate when their people are getting bombed and [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=766.48s)]
*  There's this whole floating pier. Remember the floating here that Biden wants to build the whole delivery [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=769.58s)]
*  System of that scheme was the World Central Kitchen taking the food from the pier and bringing to people [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=775.7s)]
*  So the effects of the strike are much bigger than the tragic killing of these seven people [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=781.62s)]
*  It could lead to greater famine in Gaza. And so this is a huge problem, right and I mean [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=786.42s)]
*  The US I don't know how [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=793.74s)]
*  It's it's it's actually crazy to me that we're still providing weapons to these really government [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=796.42s)]
*  I mean what else needs to happen to understand that they're not listening, you know [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=801.22s)]
*  I see statements Tommy like you know [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=806.62s)]
*  Going back and forth like every time something like this happens [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=808.6999999999999s)]
*  there's some statement where there's some concern expressed and that we call on these really government to not keep doing what they're doing and [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=811.5s)]
*  They just keep doing it and and at a certain point [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=817.62s)]
*  If you're not withholding military assistance one, you're not following US law, which says that if you know, you can't [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=821.02s)]
*  Governments can't take as military assistance and just ignore the US and potentially ignore international law and how they use it [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=828.4599999999999s)]
*  But also you're just looking [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=833.9399999999999s)]
*  I'm just gonna say you look weak because you're you just keep saying don't do something [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=836.5400000000001s)]
*  They just keep doing it and then you just keep giving them 2,000 pound bombs [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=840.82s)]
*  And in the last thing I'm gonna say because I was thinking about this [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=843.6600000000001s)]
*  I think I texted you this this morning Tommy like last night. I'm reading the news [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=846.7800000000001s)]
*  Getting rid of the podcast and the four stories in a row. I read were the strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=851.6600000000001s)]
*  The strike that killed the world central kitchen workers [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=859.1400000000001s)]
*  Bebina now wants to shut down Al Jazeera in Israel and this Al-Shifa hospital [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=862.5s)]
*  You know being completely level to the ground [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=868.74s)]
*  this is not normal, right this is not like I [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=872.2600000000001s)]
*  can't think of anything that's happened like this certainly a US ally receiving US military aid and [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=876.98s)]
*  People need to recognize that what we are looking at is not at all normal and [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=884.7s)]
*  This is a government that has become unhinged frankly and [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=890.9000000000001s)]
*  And I don't know what else to say [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=896.7s)]
*  I wish we didn't have to say this every week like I have like nothing more than to not have more more of these [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=898.58s)]
*  Things to talk about but but we have to kind of catch up to the reality of what's happening here, you know [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=903.62s)]
*  Yeah, I mean like in the White House John Kirby said that they're outraged by the strike. That's like, okay, you're outraged [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=909.1400000000001s)]
*  So so then what I mean, but to your point 200 aid workers have been killed in Gaza [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=913.2600000000001s)]
*  I mean if the the rules of engagement are so poorly constructed that you've killed 200 aid workers in six months [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=917.26s)]
*  How do you think the average Palestinian is treated? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=923.38s)]
*  of course [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=925.86s)]
*  the casualty count is [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=926.46s)]
*  30,000 people and counting and by the way this this split of like these IDF saying well X number or Hamas and [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=927.62s)]
*  Y number civilians like I don't trust any of those numbers because [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=933.3s)]
*  Apparently if you wander into some imaginary kill zone, you're treated as a combatant all of a sudden [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=937.58s)]
*  You're probably put into the Hamas pile [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=942.02s)]
*  Even if you're just a person looking for food and also been I mean to your point about the world central kitchen being the distribution point [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=943.74s)]
*  for [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=950.26s)]
*  President Biden's plan to build this temporary pier [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=951.86s)]
*  There was a report over the weekend in the Washington Post about concern that that temporary floating pier [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=954.7s)]
*  Will be just a big fat terrorist target by Palestinian Islamic jihad from Hamas [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=960.7800000000001s)]
*  Which first of all, of course it will right this thing could be like a floating [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=967.32s)]
*  Abigate like we saw at the end of the Afghanistan withdrawal like sitting out in the ocean and like that will have to be heavily [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=970.78s)]
*  Defended by US forces, but it didn't even occur to me that the the the people on the ground [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=977.86s)]
*  You know facilitating the transfer of this aid could be targeted by the IDF, but that is exactly what happened on Monday [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=983.14s)]
*  Yeah, and you know you [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=988.9799999999999s)]
*  you return to the notion that essentially [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=991.9399999999999s)]
*  Floating peers and world central kitchen there are other ways to get aid in [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=994.9399999999999s)]
*  It's just open up some of these crossings and drive some trucks of aid in you know that that's what's so frustrating is that this is [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=999.02s)]
*  Not it shouldn't be this kind of complicated [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1004.76s)]
*  But to your point this has been a pattern [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1007.66s)]
*  We've seen this is the most horrific event like this involving international aid organization [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1010.78s)]
*  But the IRC had a building hit I think doctors of that borders had a facility hit obviously unra [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1015.54s)]
*  Which Israel's basically treated as Hamas has been decimated and and and that's not normal like you know there there needs to be [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1023.14s)]
*  Established mechanisms under international law to get humanitarian aid to people that are suffering in a war zone [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1033.1s)]
*  And if your military plan doesn't allow for that then that military plan is not viable military plan [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1037.74s)]
*  It's certainly not one that the US government should support absolutely so in Israel itself [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1043.72s)]
*  Discontent over Netanyahu's handling of the war is growing [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1048.46s)]
*  Growing quickly tens of thousands of Israelis were in the streets of Jerusalem on Sunday [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1051.18s)]
*  Calling on Netanyahu to to reach a ceasefire deal to free the remaining Israeli hostages being held in Gaza [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1056.38s)]
*  Last year you know there were weekly massive protests against Netanyahu's plan to basically gut the Israeli courts [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1062.22s)]
*  But those protests had stopped after the October 7th attack so seeing them start up again was a big deal [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1069.6200000000001s)]
*  There they're also showing you know Netanyahu's also dealing with this growing threat [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1076.1000000000001s)]
*  To his governing coalition over the issue of whether ultra-orthodox Jews should have to serve in the Israeli military [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1080.34s)]
*  So most Israeli men [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1086.38s)]
*  Are forced to serve in the military for three years women for two [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1088.58s)]
*  But the ultra-orthodox which make up about 13% of the population [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1092.9s)]
*  They're exempted while studying full-time at religious schools, and they receive government subsidies [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1097.1000000000001s)]
*  So the Israeli Supreme Court said no way like this plan is ridiculous [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1102.7s)]
*  It's not fair present us with a new one and now Netanyahu is in this place where he has to try to appease his [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1106.52s)]
*  ultra-orthodox members of his coalition who want the exemption to continue but also centrist lawmakers like Benny Gantz who's a former [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1113.1s)]
*  General he's like this exemption is crazy, and it's untenable [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1120.34s)]
*  especially as [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1125.1399999999999s)]
*  The casualty count for the IDF in Gaza is now over 500 [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1126.58s)]
*  500 troops so [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1131.5s)]
*  Finally been the the Israeli Parliament as you mentioned earlier [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1133.6200000000001s)]
*  They approved this new law that will allow the government to ban foreign news networks that are considered a threat to national security [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1137.6200000000001s)]
*  The ban lasts for 45 days, but it could be renewed the to your point [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1143.06s)]
*  I mean it was passed to just target Al Jazeera which Netanyahu said he's gonna do immediately. He's calling it a terrorist channel [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1147.54s)]
*  I don't know what this means maybe for the ceasefire talks which are being mediated by Qatar and Qatar owns Al Jazeera [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1153.8200000000002s)]
*  So I bet they won't take this well, but it's just worth pointing out to your like. This is not normal point that [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1160.5s)]
*  Banning foreign news networks is the kind of thing the US condemns when it is done by Russia or Hungary or name your country [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1166.02s)]
*  But I don't know all I've seen from the White House is like if true that would be concerning type statements [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1173.5s)]
*  well, you know, I think the the common thread here right is it [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1179.02s)]
*  We're we're in the normal place of BB Nenya where he's just kind of navigating his own political survival, you know [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1183.34s)]
*  So it's like balancing between the alter orthodox and coalition and balancing between [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1189.46s)]
*  The people are like this is crazy like this exemption [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1194.5s)]
*  This exemption was rooted in the kind of Israel's founding at a time when there were far far less [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1197.46s)]
*  or 500 [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1202.18s)]
*  Yeah, and so it just doesn't make any sense anymore [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1203.54s)]
*  But what's so strange is watching this person who's leading a government that is in this war that has global implications [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1206.7s)]
*  And it's like his coalition politics are the things I know [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1214.6200000000001s)]
*  You know and when you see the Israelis who are protesting and I think they deserve a lot of credit [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1218.22s)]
*  You know the common refrain is we need a prime minister who's thinking about something other than his political survival, you know [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1223.6200000000001s)]
*  Because all he's doing is just tacking around and then this Al Jazeera thing. Yeah, it just [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1230.1000000000001s)]
*  We we always heard about like the IDF is the world's most moral army. We've talked about that [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1236.38s)]
*  We always certainly Israel's the democracy in the Middle East will you know banning? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1240.8200000000002s)]
*  Cable television station you don't like it's not it's not democratic, you know, so it's just to me it [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1246.3s)]
*  There needs to be a kind of reset here in the Israeli government an election [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1252.6599999999999s)]
*  Ideally someone other than that Yahoo gets in there probably Benny Gans again. No left winger, but just [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1259.06s)]
*  This this is not working. This current iteration is not working [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1265.58s)]
*  Yeah, I mean one man's you know concern about getting prosecuted [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1268.98s)]
*  I was concerned about getting prosecuted driving this entire war and my my fear is that this war is making Israel less safe [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1272.02s)]
*  It's making the US less safe that in you know [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1278.7s)]
*  a couple years some terrorist group is gonna attack or try to attack the US and they're gonna point to US support for the Israeli [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1281.54s)]
*  Military campaign in Gaza and you know, no one should wonder how that happened [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1289.02s)]
*  Um a couple other quick things Ben is just that the remember last week [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1293.34s)]
*  Netanyahu canceling a delegation trip to Washington DC to talk about their plan to invade Rafa that city in southern Gaza [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1297.9s)]
*  Where a million Palestinians are sheltering that you know meeting finally happened via video conference [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1305.6200000000001s)]
*  So I guess that was the middle ground they found [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1311.38s)]
*  But the reports out of it say the US still hasn't seen a viable plan to protect civilians in Rafa [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1313.5400000000002s)]
*  Biden's national security advisor Jake Sullivan is going to Saudi Arabia later this week [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1318.5800000000002s)]
*  They're still trying to ink this normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel despite all that's going on [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1323.12s)]
*  So interesting that they're still you know pursuing that and then just finally there's a bunch of new polling out about American views of the war [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1329.52s)]
*  There's a new Gallup poll that found 55% disapproval of Israeli military actions in Gaza and only 36% approval [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1337.0s)]
*  And then Quinnipiac found 52% of Americans oppose more military aid to Israel first 39% who support it [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1344.24s)]
*  So I just hope you know President Biden had pretty strong feelings about [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1351.2s)]
*  Both his personal commitment to Israel and the politics of this early on I hope people are just watching how fast [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1355.72s)]
*  Everything is changing. Yeah, and in the trajectory is very clear and and nothing's gonna change that trajectory, right? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1362.0800000000002s)]
*  Because this just keeps getting worse with time [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1368.68s)]
*  like the only thing that's gonna change is if there's a ceasefire and then some some [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1370.92s)]
*  credible effort to address humanitarian crisis and the political dynamic here because [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1375.48s)]
*  You know, they have the longer this goes on. Obviously the worst above all this for Palestinians. I think the worst it is politically [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1381.28s)]
*  For Joe Biden, you know, you've got even Donald Trump saying like they need to write it up [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1388.0800000000002s)]
*  you know, like so this I think we are living through something of a [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1392.04s)]
*  sea-change in American public opinion [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1396.24s)]
*  on this issue and [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1399.24s)]
*  And I think we're gonna look back on this as a pretty big, you know pivot point in history for a lot of reasons [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1401.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with you [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1407.0s)]
*  Okay, well that is this section of the show where we are generally quite critical of the administration's handling of Gaza [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1408.6s)]
*  But I do think it's we're checking in [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1413.9199999999998s)]
*  once again on the creeps and the goons who would likely be working for Trump in national security roles if he wins the [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1416.0s)]
*  Election in November. So one such creep then is a guy named Rick Grinnell [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1423.36s)]
*  Grinnell was a spokesman for John Bolton when John Bolton was the ambassador to the UN [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1427.8799999999999s)]
*  For years Grinnell was basically known for just being a vicious Twitter troll [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1432.48s)]
*  Who was nasty to journalists and anyone else he came across and then Trump kind of plucked him out of obscurity to make him ambassador [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1436.3999999999999s)]
*  To Germany where he pissed off everybody except for the super far-right [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1443.1999999999998s)]
*  Then Grinnell was asked by Trump to mediate between [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1448.12s)]
*  Tensions between Serbia and Kosovo a job that he seems to have interpreted as meaning basically just side with Serbia the stronger power [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1451.6799999999998s)]
*  With whatever they want then in the last few months of the administration [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1458.4799999999998s)]
*  He became acting director of national intelligence despite having zero relevant experience [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1462.32s)]
*  So the reason we're talking about him is because the Washington Post did a big story about how Rick Grinnell is running around the world [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1467.32s)]
*  Telling people that he is gonna be the next Secretary of State. He popped up in Guatemala where Grinnell was hanging out with this far-right [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1474.08s)]
*  President who had lost an election and was trying to stage a coup basically and hang on to office [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1482.04s)]
*  The New York Times reported we talked about this recently [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1487.16s)]
*  That Grinnell was working with Jared Kushner to try to like grease a bunch of real estate deals with Serbian and Albanian [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1489.8799999999999s)]
*  government officials and then the Post reported in this big story on Grinnell that he had been trying to broker meetings with foreign leaders in Trump [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1495.6s)]
*  including with Prime Minister Erdogan of Turkey like a couple years ago when Biden was president like things that are just [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1504.6s)]
*  completely inappropriate so [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1510.08s)]
*  The other weird note on this Ben was Grinnell was apparently an executive at Newsmax for a while [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1511.96s)]
*  Which we'll talk about in a little more later [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1517.14s)]
*  But look, it's just a reminder that a second Trump term would start out with the worst of the worst [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1519.98s)]
*  Like we made fun of the self-important community to save America people the Jim Mattis's of the world [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1527.42s)]
*  You know the like folks who you know briefed reporters at the Atlantic about how much they were doing to protect all of us [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1532.94s)]
*  But it is gonna get worse and I think it's just you know, it's fine to criticize Biden's foreign policy [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1538.8600000000001s)]
*  But just know that like it's gonna get worse if Trump wins [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1543.18s)]
*  We should say yeah, we're quite critical in Gaza, but I mean if you care about climate change, you don't care about democracy [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1546.06s)]
*  It's not a close call and then when you add these people into the mix and and look it's very clear that Rick Grinnell [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1551.78s)]
*  Is in the inner inner circle here? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1557.54s)]
*  He's gonna have some big job in a second Trump term Secretary of State National Security Advisor something like that, which is [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1559.7s)]
*  Insane like this guy is a petty vindictive [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1565.86s)]
*  Internet troll essentially and as corrupt and self-interested wanted that you know [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1570.6599999999999s)]
*  And I think it does kind of telegraph like what what we'd be in store for guys like this [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1575.98s)]
*  There's this guy cash Patel who is like, you know like a bottom feeder at the end of the administration [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1581.54s)]
*  I think he was at like DOD for a while [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1587.98s)]
*  But these these these are the ultra MAGA people that are gonna be there from day one [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1590.66s)]
*  and and I think the thing that should stand out and the Grinnell piece is [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1595.6200000000001s)]
*  You know, we can all kind of laugh at their lack of you know qualifications for some of these jobs [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1601.3s)]
*  But I think we should take more seriously is [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1606.54s)]
*  That he sees his roles in part kind of knitting together this far-right global alliance [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1610.26s)]
*  And see Bannon's been involved in this too and we haven't talked about him in a while [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1615.86s)]
*  This is a serious ideological project like these people actually do have a worldview and it's a worldview in which like a [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1620.7s)]
*  second Trump administration [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1627.54s)]
*  Aligns itself with basically the far right in Europe, you know, it's National Front in France. It's the AFP party in Germany [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1629.22s)]
*  It's Bolsonaro in Brazil. It's the kind of more even you know, the the most right-wing version of Modi in India [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1636.1000000000001s)]
*  This is scary stuff, right? And so this is not something that is worth taking a risk [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1643.42s)]
*  And and and I think we should have eyes open and yeah Tommy I was joking you recently like I don't [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1650.14s)]
*  I still kind of [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1655.8200000000002s)]
*  Feel pretty ambivalent about anybody who went to work for Trump, but maybe that those committee people actually [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1657.86s)]
*  Pulled back some crazy shit from happening. I don't know [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1662.74s)]
*  Yeah [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1665.22s)]
*  I'm preparing to eat my own words if he wins again and wish for the good old days of Mattis and you know [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1665.5s)]
*  Yeah [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1672.1s)]
*  You mentioning Steve Bannon you being Italy maybe remember remember when Steve Bannon tried to open what he called a gladiator school for her [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1673.22s)]
*  for right-wing politicians in like a 13th century [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1680.34s)]
*  Monastery or something in Italy and the courts blocked him from doing it [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1684.58s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, but he was like all he helps. I think the box party the far right party in Spain [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1690.02s)]
*  You know, he actually did, you know, he helped with the Bolsonaro campaign like so this is like this is a real thing [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1695.9s)]
*  It's easy to just think it's like Steve Bannon's podcast and and some real estate deals [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1702.06s)]
*  But like there's also like ideology behind it that it's pretty scary. Yeah, and they also have [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1707.18s)]
*  They have a bunch of media [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1712.78s)]
*  Apparatuses behind them [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1714.5s)]
*  So the teaser about Newsmax was a reference to a big report in the Washington Post about this right-wing news site Newsmax [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1715.46s)]
*  according to a bunch of leaked documents from a financial services company in the Cayman Islands a [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1722.82s)]
*  member of the Qatari royal family invested 50 million dollars into Newsmax [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1727.74s)]
*  Through a London based investment firm that is also owned by a member of the Qatar's royal family [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1732.94s)]
*  So two people who were Newsmax employees at the time told the Washington Post that around the time of this investment both before and after [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1738.26s)]
*  They were told not to criticize Qatar and to soften on-air coverage by quote [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1746.06s)]
*  Including by avoiding discussion of the nation's human rights record and treatment of migrant labor ahead of it hosting the World Cup in [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1751.3s)]
*  2022 so again, this was the time when actually there was a big conversation about these issues [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1757.9s)]
*  They also said in this story that Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1763.34s)]
*  Verbally reprimanded a host for on-air comments about Qatar [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1767.5s)]
*  Ruddy and Newsmax deny all this of course the post at a major selling point to the Qataris for the investment was the claim that [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1771.74s)]
*  Ruddy was close friends with Trump, which is true [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1779.5s)]
*  I think they just run into each other in Mar-a-Lago and Ruddy became this kind of like [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1782.28s)]
*  Man about town all of a sudden in the Trump administration with this fringe weirdo and right-wing media to like [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1786.26s)]
*  I don't know Trump's buddy [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1792.24s)]
*  and [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1794.32s)]
*  You know like so just it's worth noting then that on top of this [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1795.36s)]
*  investment into Newsmax [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1800.24s)]
*  There was a report done by House Democrats [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1802.1200000000001s)]
*  That found the Qatar spent about three-quarters of a million dollars at Trump's hotels in New York and DC during his presidency [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1805.68s)]
*  So just a lot of cash getting siphoned into Trump's pockets into right-wing [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1812.48s)]
*  Apparatuses that support him so I don't know Ben. What do you think good investment here? [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1817.84s)]
*  Like I was pretty shocked by this they dropped 50 million dollars [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1821.48s)]
*  Yeah, but you know at a certain point [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1826.04s)]
*  I mean if the previous you know segment was about the ideology the second piece of the Trump project is just [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1828.04s)]
*  out and out corruption right and [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1835.72s)]
*  Trump likes cash and the people around Trump like cash and who has cash [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1839.52s)]
*  It's the Gulf states it's Saudi Arabia the UAE and Qatar and [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1844.44s)]
*  At a certain point like I almost don't blame them. Look, of course, they're doing this like, you know [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1850.08s)]
*  Because if you were pumping that much oil and gas out of the ground and it's just printing money [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1856.28s)]
*  You know vine, you know a few hundred million dollars here for Newsmax and a few hundred million dollars over there for you [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1860.92s)]
*  Know real estate deals and then like a few presidential suites at the Trump properties, you know [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1866.8s)]
*  You know gonna have some cash flow problems given all the litigation he's faced [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1872.64s)]
*  I mean the vulnerability of a again a second Trump term to just just [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1877.56s)]
*  ungodly amounts of corruption [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1884.24s)]
*  Because that's what all these these countries have concluded that this is how to do business, right? [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1886.3600000000001s)]
*  And by the way, this is how they do business in some other parts of the world, right? [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1891.04s)]
*  I mean we saw this in Malaysia where they basically, you know [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1894.92s)]
*  Let's just say like cash bought a lot of things right and and so I think [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1898.3s)]
*  This is easy to we make fun of it sometimes too, but this is serious too because essentially, you know [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1904.66s)]
*  They anticipate that a second Trump term, you know would be for hire for their own purposes [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1910.34s)]
*  And by the way, it's kind of funny because Newsmax and Al Jazeera have a slightly different editorial line. Yeah [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1916.0s)]
*  Just like a little like they yeah different vibes on Gaza [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1922.46s)]
*  I'm imagine good no, but your point is well taken because like I think imagine your Qatar [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1926.8200000000002s)]
*  You're like this tiny your Connecticut sized country that is off the tip of Saudi Arabia [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1931.5600000000002s)]
*  You are watching the heavy hitters in the region Saudi Arabia the UAE others [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1938.14s)]
*  Going to the White House having Oval Office meetings [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1943.7s)]
*  Remember that that that meeting with Trump and Mohammed bin Salman where he pulled out the like [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1946.38s)]
*  Look, it looked like a third graders diorama of all the weapons systems [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1951.0s)]
*  The Saudis were buying for like billions and billions of dollars. They're seeing that happen. They're seeing their sworn enemies [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1954.6s)]
*  Greasing the Trump administration and they're thinking oh shit [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1961.04s)]
*  We got to get in the game and we got to pay off the right guys and we got to do it immediately [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1963.84s)]
*  So, of course, they're scrambling to find ways to funnel money to the kind of MAGA movement. It's like sir [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1967.24s)]
*  I was it. Yeah, and there was that internal fight in the the GCC is that golf, you know [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1973.44s)]
*  Cooperative of countries and a member like Qatar got like kicked out and there was like a blockade on them. Yeah [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1978.52s)]
*  Yeah, so I think they're just like well, we're just gonna try to spend our way out of this, you know [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1984.32s)]
*  And I mean, yeah, like just show their sensitivity around the World Cup, which you experienced [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1989.56s)]
*  I remember the the government of Qatar didn't exactly take kindly to [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=1994.72s)]
*  Didn't love it didn't love it. Well, you know in quick and media could get a sponsorship [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2003.68s)]
*  from Qatar for you know, a few hundred million and you know, maybe [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2008.0s)]
*  World Cup number three could be about I don't know [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2011.6000000000001s)]
*  James Dolan and the Knicks or something. There you go. I'm down to do that [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2015.1200000000001s)]
*  Anyway, great story a great reporting by The Washington Post everyone should check it out. It's worth reading [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2018.68s)]
*  Let's talk to something turn to something very different Ben some more really in-depth reporting though [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2023.28s)]
*  So a couple weeks back we talked about Havana syndrome [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2027.66s)]
*  Which is the catch-all term for these unexplained health issues that US spies and diplomats and officials [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2031.2s)]
*  Have been experiencing since about 2016 the first cases that became public were in Cuba. So it became called Havana syndrome [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2037.04s)]
*  We talked about the release of an NIH study that showed that there were no signs of long-term brain damage in those who had symptoms [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2044.08s)]
*  So good news that there's not brain damage, but obviously if you're having symptoms, you're having symptoms. It didn't make anyone feel better [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2051.16s)]
*  What was fascinating was just a couple weeks later? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2057.2s)]
*  60 minutes released this really in-depth report like they did like half the show on Havana syndrome and they reported [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2060.36s)]
*  New evidence that connected Havana syndrome directly to Russia [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2066.76s)]
*  So the new evidence suggests that a Russian spy group known as unit two nine one five five [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2071.32s)]
*  Might be testing a directed energy weapon on US government employees around the world. This was a collaboration [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2076.84s)]
*  It was 60 minutes the insider in der Spiegel is about a year-long investigation [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2083.0s)]
*  And so one of their core findings was that senior members of this Russian unit got awards and political [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2086.84s)]
*  Promotions for the work they did related to the development of these non-lethal acoustic weapons [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2093.6400000000003s)]
*  They even discovered that reports of Havana syndrome began happening long before the 2016 cases in in Cuba [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2099.2400000000002s)]
*  There were there was one victim who was knocked unconscious from this alleged weapon [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2106.32s)]
*  Receiving a traumatic brain injury. This woman was knocked unconscious from this [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2110.76s)]
*  From something she thinks it was from a directed energy weapon. She after this [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2115.32s)]
*  Attack occurred she went outside. She saw a car. She saw a man by the car years later [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2120.82s)]
*  Belling cat in 60 minutes these organizations researching or sent a photo of someone who they think was involved in these attacks [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2126.66s)]
*  And she said it was the same guy. So they're sort of like IDing specific Russian officials at the location [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2133.2000000000003s)]
*  So anyway, this unit that twenty twenty nine one five five unit [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2139.94s)]
*  Their scope is lethal operation acts of sabotage their mission is basically like take out the people that Putin doesn't like [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2144.54s)]
*  That goes well beyond just intelligence collection. So the 60 minute piece included interview with a guy named Greg Ed Green [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2152.8199999999997s)]
*  He's a lieutenant colonel in the US Army whose investigation led to the conclusion that foreign adversaries are not involved [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2160.66s)]
*  But he said that that was only because the bar for proof was set impossibly high then this report [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2167.2599999999998s)]
*  The insider the 60 minutes report they just came to a very different conclusion than what the office of the director of national intelligence [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2174.14s)]
*  Said in March of 2023 when they said it was very unlikely that Havana syndrome was caused by a foreign adversary [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2181.2599999999998s)]
*  Let me just stop there. Did you watch this report? What did you make of it? How convinced were you? First of all? [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2188.72s)]
*  If only you or I had a voice like that, you know [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2194.42s)]
*  Like that is that that pellet? Yeah, it's just like hell. Oh, yeah, Scott Pelley was the way he winds things up [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2197.08s)]
*  It's just so dramatic. You know, you just want to you really want to know what's coming. Anyway, yeah [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2203.2s)]
*  He's like a human upright base, you know, it's just very [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2208.16s)]
*  Impelling look I gotta say when this first happened right when I first learned of these quote-unquote Havana syndrome attacks [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2211.44s)]
*  In twenty, I think 17. Yeah, I was shocked because I had actually been responsible for Cuba policy at the end [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2218.3199999999997s)]
*  Administration had not heard about this [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2225.2000000000003s)]
*  Then the the immediate conclusion that I drew at the time and frankly, you know in Havana [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2227.48s)]
*  I had a conversation with the US diplomat [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2233.64s)]
*  Was that the this this the only people who could do this are the Russians right? [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2237.44s)]
*  They're the only people that have that kind of capability a willingness to kind of harm people physically in third countries [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2241.2000000000003s)]
*  they have a lot of interests at that time in [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2247.12s)]
*  Derailing the opening in the US and Cuba because it kind of put them at risk [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2249.96s)]
*  But also I put their interest in Cuba risk [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2254.04s)]
*  I should say but then I also had personal experience on me like it, you know, five years ago this podcast [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2256.72s)]
*  I'm probably told the story but when I was negotiating with the Cubans to normalize relations, I [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2262.36s)]
*  was in [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2267.16s)]
*  in an airport hotel in Toronto [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2268.68s)]
*  Trailed by some Russians who want clearly wanted me to know that they were watching me in Havana the first time I went to Havana [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2272.12s)]
*  Some people came up really close to me speaking Russian like wanted me to know like hey, we we see what you're doing, right and [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2278.04s)]
*  And so I always suspected that if the foreign government was behind this [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2287.8799999999997s)]
*  The Cubans would be the you know, I don't think they had this capability [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2292.48s)]
*  I don't think that that they would have taken the risk to do this and it was same way the Russians would [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2296.48s)]
*  So, I don't know looking at the report [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2301.56s)]
*  It kind of validates like what I [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2304.7599999999998s)]
*  instinctively believed at the time [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2308.08s)]
*  And also kind of validates [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2310.9199999999996s)]
*  Something that concerned me which is at that time [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2313.2799999999997s)]
*  Some of the hardliners around Trump who had Cuba on the brain like Marco Rubio [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2316.56s)]
*  They used this Havana syndrome stuff to essentially shutter the US Embassy put some more sanctions on roll back [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2322.16s)]
*  Yeah, the Obama opening and so what I was worried about at the time is it well [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2328.3799999999997s)]
*  Trump's not gonna want to point the finger to Russia and he's got some political reasons given, you know [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2333.92s)]
*  He's people down in Florida to point the finger at the Cubans, which is what they did [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2338.44s)]
*  All that said I don't know what happened, you know [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2344.32s)]
*  Like the DNI is pretty categorical and saying that you know, we don't think this was a foreign government [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2346.6400000000003s)]
*  I've talked to various people in non-government or say that they don't even know that something happened [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2352.4s)]
*  Then you talk to other people say this is you know, something terrible happened [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2357.2400000000002s)]
*  Then you see this report which seems pretty credible, but it's pretty let's face it [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2361.2599999999998s)]
*  it's you know, even the belly cat thing is you know, that's an interesting piece of evidence, but [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2365.66s)]
*  You know, you know, it's you would want more of that to kind of feel confident in this assessment, right? [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2371.22s)]
*  I think what we can say without a doubt is that the US government has just not you know [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2376.24s)]
*  Was not transparent about this was not forthcoming about this from the get-go from the jump because they politicized it to punish Cuba [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2381.7599999999998s)]
*  It immediately kind of came out the wrong way sideways the Biden [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2388.7999999999997s)]
*  Administration seemed to take a while to like start sharing information about this and that does feed it into what you heard from that guy [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2393.32s)]
*  which is you know, I [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2399.64s)]
*  I see why you saying that you know, and this is not to kind of this is this is not to impugn people government [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2402.0s)]
*  It's actually just to say like if this is the Russians [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2407.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, what do you do about it? You know, like it's it's what is it's a really tough problem because [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2411.2s)]
*  On the one end you're like, well we can't secure our people anywhere [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2416.6s)]
*  And the other end you're like, well, do we go to war over this? [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2419.84s)]
*  Like what what you know, it represents this kind of new wild west that we're in that is quite scary, you know [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2422.64s)]
*  so [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2428.6800000000003s)]
*  To me the main lesson is just be more transparent and on top of this stuff from the get-go which which was more of a Trump [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2429.76s)]
*  You know issue than a Biden issue. Yeah, I mean I had a similar reaction the 60 minutes report was very interesting [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2436.46s)]
*  There was lots of fascinating circumstantial evidence like yeah, they had dashcam footage of this [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2442.6000000000004s)]
*  Russian guy getting pulled over who was clearly a spy [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2448.44s)]
*  He had weird devices in his car and like they could erase the GPS data on your car or like a bunch of passports [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2450.96s)]
*  Etc, etc [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2457.44s)]
*  But I just it didn't feel like they really nailed it which again obviously like easier said than done [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2458.48s)]
*  but you know, they quoted they interviewed someone who was like one of the reasons I know it was Russia is [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2464.84s)]
*  Because a lot of the targets were our highest performing [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2469.96s)]
*  kind of counterintel people on Russia or like staff in various sectors of the government that were [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2473.96s)]
*  tasked with managing Russia were the most effective and those were the people getting taken out and I was like [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2480.92s)]
*  That's kind of like exactly the ex post facto analysis. We want to avoid in these situations as opposed to [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2485.96s)]
*  evidence, but I don't know again, I feel like I [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2493.16s)]
*  Study up on this thing and I I know less than I did before I started I but at least less certainty [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2497.36s)]
*  I mean I think one thing I'll say is and it kind of ties back to what we're saying the very beginning about Israel hitting the [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2502.6s)]
*  the consulate in Damascus [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2508.6800000000003s)]
*  We do seem to be moving into some pretty choppy waters here. Where are these norms around? [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2511.04s)]
*  You know not harming diplomats or not blowing up facilities or the Russians have assassinated people in third countries [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2516.96s)]
*  We saw India assassinate somebody in in Canada these kind of basics of how the world works [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2523.12s)]
*  Are beginning to fray and that that's dangerous because it's hard to put that stuff back in a box [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2530.3199999999997s)]
*  You know [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2536.3199999999997s)]
*  I if we could just get to a place where like diplomats are protected facilities are protected people aren't assassinated in third countries like [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2536.84s)]
*  that that would [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2544.3199999999997s)]
*  That would make me feel a lot better. You know, yeah speaking of frayed norms [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2546.04s)]
*  Gets us to our next story about Wall Street Journal reporter named Evan Kershkovich [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2550.08s)]
*  Who was arrested about a year ago in Russia and has been held in a prison hostage ever since this was just a horrible [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2554.12s)]
*  Case of a young American reporter getting swept up by Putin in one of his endless political battles against the West [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2560.52s)]
*  He is being held on espionage charges that could carry a penalty of up to 20 years in prison [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2566.88s)]
*  He and the Wall Street Journal have vehemently denied the spying allegations since the very beginning [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2571.8s)]
*  They're they're self-evidently ridiculous all this time Kershkovich has been held in pretrial detention [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2576.44s)]
*  And just last week that was extended for another three months [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2582.76s)]
*  They're not even trying to try the guy [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2586.56s)]
*  His colleagues at the Wall Street Journal have fought hard to keep him in the news in front of mind for President Biden [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2588.1600000000003s)]
*  Biden released a statement last Friday on the one-year mark saying quote [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2593.52s)]
*  We will continue to denounce and impose costs for Russia's appalling attempts to use Americans as bargaining chips [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2597.02s)]
*  And we will continue to stand strong against all those who seek to attack the press or target journalists the pillars to free society [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2602.38s)]
*  There's another American named Paul Whelan who's being held in a Russian prison [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2609.1800000000003s)]
*  He was sentenced to 16 years in prison for espionage. That story is even weirder. He was arrested in 2019 [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2612.38s)]
*  He was basically hanging out with a Russian citizen who Whelan says handed him a USB Drive shortly after he was arrested [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2618.1s)]
*  The Russians say it was classified information that Whelan's a spy again the US government and Whelan deny that [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2625.38s)]
*  So Ben, you know, we talked a lot about these hostage situations in Russia and hostage swaps when Brittany Greiner was being held by the Russian government [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2632.38s)]
*  She was ultimately released in a swap for an arms dealer named Victor bout [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2639.34s)]
*  Putin's price to release Evan Gershkovich seems to be a Russian assassin currently being held in a German prison camp [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2644.02s)]
*  That's a tall order to get the Germans to release this guy because he's a real killer [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2650.98s)]
*  So Ben, I don't know. They're just like it's a year into this. It's an impossible problem. It's not clear to me if Putin [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2655.58s)]
*  Views this in isolation, right? [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2661.9s)]
*  like he takes Evan Gershkovich he tries to swap him for something and that's like a contained thing or whether this is all tied up into [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2663.86s)]
*  broader fights over Ukraine or whatever grievance he has [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2671.02s)]
*  And obviously, you know, we all want these Americans to come home [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2674.86s)]
*  But I do think it's fair to wonder if the Griner swap may be incentivized Putin to kidnap more Americans because [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2677.5s)]
*  He knows he can get something out of it [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2684.3s)]
*  So, I don't know any takeaways from you sort of a year into this detention [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2685.9s)]
*  Well, I think it's both Putin wanting to get something in return and and it also may just be Putin trying to send a message that [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2688.9s)]
*  There's no reporting a lot in Russia, you know, so I think there were kind of two dimensions to the Evan Gershkovich [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2696.34s)]
*  Wrongful detention and and he's kind of succeeded in the lottery, you know, like it's [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2702.82s)]
*  Western journalists are kind of not really operating obviously Russian journalists have been [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2708.58s)]
*  largely silenced or exiled and [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2712.98s)]
*  You're right, I mean this this the cost keeps going out like Victor Pruitt was a pretty high price to pay [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2716.5s)]
*  You know one of the most big arms dealers [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2723.26s)]
*  And then when you start talking about, you know other countries releasing assassins [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2726.3s)]
*  At a certain point there there there are swaps you don't want to do, you know [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2732.6600000000003s)]
*  Right, and so I think for Evan's sake and his family's you have to keep trying everything you can [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2737.1400000000003s)]
*  But I do think you also have to start saying there's like a ceiling on this and it does seem kind of [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2742.02s)]
*  You know asking third countries to start and suddenly start getting involved in these swaps [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2749.06s)]
*  That feels like a you know, we're introducing a whole new slope that can become slippery too. So [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2754.74s)]
*  It's a horrible situation [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2759.98s)]
*  but you know, yeah, you there is a balance between [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2762.34s)]
*  not wanting to incentivize and reward this kind of activity and [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2766.7s)]
*  Unfortunately, one of the tragic lessons is like [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2770.78s)]
*  Americans have to be really careful about where they go and I'm not that's not no of course at all to blame Evan [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2774.5s)]
*  Because he was doing his job. He wasn't like a tourist, you know [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2779.44s)]
*  But it's just it's kind of what we're just talking about. It's a more dangerous world. Yeah [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2782.78s)]
*  And look the US just has limited leverage here. I mean Vladimir Putin gets to decide if he released this guy [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2786.5s)]
*  Let's turn to Scotland then a couple more quick things here [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2791.86s)]
*  So there was an interesting report from the BBC about a new anti-hate crime law in Scotland [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2793.94s)]
*  So quote stirring up hatred and quote about someone's age [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2798.66s)]
*  Disability religion sexual orientation or sexual identity is now a crime that can get you up to seven years in prison [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2803.18s)]
*  Here's a graph from this BBC story about all this [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2809.7799999999997s)]
*  quote a person commits an offense if they communicate material or behave in a manner that a [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2813.2599999999998s)]
*  Reasonable person would consider to be threatening or abusive with the intention of stirring up hatred based on the protected characteristics [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2818.1s)]
*  So there was already a hate crime law in place in Scotland [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2825.1s)]
*  About race color nationality or ethnicity [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2830.38s)]
*  But this new law the bar for prosecution seems to be a little lower [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2833.42s)]
*  It includes insulting behavior and the prosecution only needs to show that the end result of stirring up hatred was likely [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2837.94s)]
*  Not necessarily that it was intended [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2845.38s)]
*  So I don't know they supposedly have some safeguards in place in [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2847.74s)]
*  Protections for you know kind of like shocking ideas or disturbing ideas [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2851.3s)]
*  Opponents of the law say it's flawed. They say here's an example from again from the BBC [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2855.98s)]
*  Quote if an assailant punched someone in the face while also making a hateful comment about their age that might be assault [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2861.1000000000004s)]
*  Aggravated by age related hatred. So that's sort of a bizarre case that you could see emerging from the law [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2867.1400000000003s)]
*  There was a lawmaker who voted no [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2872.38s)]
*  Who's pointed out that you could actually be arrested for [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2875.1s)]
*  Quote stirring up hatred because of comments you make in your own home, not just public places [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2877.94s)]
*  So I don't know that I haven't studied this law deeply [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2882.34s)]
*  I obviously don't want anyone to be using hate speech ever [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2884.78s)]
*  but like I think the the American in me the the First Amendment lover in me kind of [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2888.3s)]
*  Stood back to the idea that you know, you get seven years in prison in prison for for speech, but I don't know [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2894.7000000000003s)]
*  What do you think? Yeah, I mean, yeah [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2899.86s)]
*  Grinnell secretary of state a better stay away from Scotland. He's done [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2902.06s)]
*  He's gone in the can I mean, yeah, it does [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2906.54s)]
*  It does make you wonder, you know [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2910.98s)]
*  This is just feels like it's pushing too far [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2914.86s)]
*  And it's not not clear what problem it's solving [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2917.7400000000002s)]
*  That you couldn't address through more narrowly tailored hate crime laws, you know [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2922.42s)]
*  and again, I'm not the free speech lawyer, but like [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2926.78s)]
*  This does feel like a pretty broad definition and of course people would try to push the envelope, you know in its application. So [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2929.5400000000004s)]
*  It may be that yeah, look we're all having debates about this and we all share the objective of preventing hate crimes [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2937.6200000000003s)]
*  but we also I think get along comfortable if it's kind of [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2944.46s)]
*  If it's just insulting speech or something that you're doing seven years for even if it's speech I hate so [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2948.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, this is one be interesting to watch how this plays out [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2954.3s)]
*  Assume there's a backlash and we'll see if there's a way to more narrowly scope it [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2958.54s)]
*  Yeah, this is how it's how it's applied ultimately will be I think the key test [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2962.2599999999998s)]
*  Let's turn to Venezuela then because there's once again some serious doubts about whether President Nicolas Maduro is going to allow free and fair elections [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2966.18s)]
*  So the latest news is that a candidate named Maria Machado. She's a popular Venezuelan opposition leader [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2974.5s)]
*  She's been barred from running against Maduro in the elections this summer [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2980.7s)]
*  Machado is a 56 year old member of the National Assembly. She's well known [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2984.56s)]
*  She overwhelmingly run won the primary last year with like 90% of the vote [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2988.92s)]
*  Now she can't run so she's gonna support some other candidate this lesser-known academic [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2993.64s)]
*  but the decision to [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=2998.84s)]
*  Not allow Machado to run [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3001.16s)]
*  Could have big ramifications in Washington because last year the Biden administration agreed to ease sanctions on Venezuela's oil and gas sector [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3003.2s)]
*  If Maduro allowed a free and fair election this year in 2024 at the time the bar was set [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3011.24s)]
*  By Tony Blinken, I believe by it free and fair being that all candidates have to be reinstated and allowed to run [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3018.4799999999996s)]
*  So obviously that has not happened [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3024.7999999999997s)]
*  So in practice what they did to ease sanctions was have the Treasury Department [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3026.3199999999997s)]
*  authorize [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3031.6s)]
*  Give a six-month license [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3032.7999999999997s)]
*  Giving American oil and gas companies the ability to work with Venezuela for that period that license expires on April 18th [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3034.7999999999997s)]
*  And so the question now becomes will Biden reimpose sanctions in a couple weeks when it expires [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3042.2s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal reported that they are leaning against reimposing sanctions the reasons being [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3048.0s)]
*  Concerned that sanctions would just jack up gas prices that they would lead to more migration out of Venezuela and probably north to the US [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3054.8799999999997s)]
*  And basically just cause Maduro to turn away from the West even further and look to Russia and China to sell oil and gas [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3062.1600000000003s)]
*  So Ben, this is a tough one because obviously, you know [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3069.44s)]
*  You don't want to let another government just renege on a promise like that [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3071.52s)]
*  But in addition to the concerns we just I just mentioned here [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3075.5600000000004s)]
*  It is also the case that US sanctions on Venezuela have done absolutely nothing to weaken Maduro's grip on the country [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3079.76s)]
*  They just seem to have caused enormous economic hardship and suffering for the people [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3086.54s)]
*  So, I don't know. I hope this Wall Street Journal is right and that we're not gonna mindlessly kind of slap [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3090.26s)]
*  Sanctions back on Venezuela. Maybe there's a more targeted approach [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3095.5400000000004s)]
*  Specifically at Maduro, but I don't know [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3099.1400000000003s)]
*  What did you make of of these reports in the political decision the Biden team's gonna have to make I mean I I agree with you [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3100.78s)]
*  That it's not like sanctions [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3107.0200000000004s)]
*  work [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3109.5800000000004s)]
*  and I [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3111.94s)]
*  Think that what you need to do is you what are the other tools you have like yes [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3114.9s)]
*  Maybe there's something more targeted Maduro and people around them [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3118.94s)]
*  But also like what can be done to continue to raise the volume of this issue in the region? [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3122.14s)]
*  So it's not just the US talking about it, you know, it's it's other countries in Latin America including some some left-wing leaders down there [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3128.44s)]
*  Whose voices can be important and kind of continuing to kind of put a spotlight on what Maduro is doing [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3135.44s)]
*  Continuing to speak out in support of elections [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3140.58s)]
*  You want to build the kind of a course of countries that are pushing on this [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3143.1s)]
*  So it's not just like every sitting back and watching the inevitable drama of like the US slapped some sanctions on [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3147.62s)]
*  Maduro rest some more opposition leaders and just you know, you know gets cozier with China and Russia [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3152.98s)]
*  So I I think it's the the the the sanctions reaction [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3157.78s)]
*  While it could be understandable is not the right lever to be pulling here [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3163.02s)]
*  It's it's other diplomacy other ways of keeping the spotlight on this [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3167.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I hope we just can move beyond the politics here and not let you know Marco Rubio [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3170.94s)]
*  Browbeat the administration to putting a bunch of sanctions on that won't work [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3175.7s)]
*  Yeah [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3178.6s)]
*  a couple more quick things that were done the New York Times reported that [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3179.02s)]
*  China is getting into the election [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3182.02s)]
*  Disinformation game by using a bunch of fake social media accounts to promote Trump and various right-wing conspiracy theories [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3183.62s)]
*  So what's happening is all of a sudden social media accounts that used to you know [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3189.2599999999998s)]
*  Attack the Dalai Lama and Mandarin or whatever are purporting to be you know [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3193.2s)]
*  soccer moms and dads from Ohio who love Trump a [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3198.1s)]
*  Nonprofit called the Institute for Strategic Dialogue said that a Chinese linked account on Twitter [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3201.54s)]
*  posted conspiracy theories that Joe Biden and the CIA sent a neo-nazi to fight in Ukraine a [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3206.8999999999996s)]
*  Theory that is easily debunked but it received a lot of traction when Alex Jones retweeted it the next day to his millions of followers [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3212.5s)]
*  It does not help that these accounts these Chinese disinformation accounts can just pay [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3220.22s)]
*  Elon Musk and Twitter like eight bucks a month or whatever for verification and [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3224.74s)]
*  Algorithmic amplification a lot of the accounts are not trying very hard [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3229.02s)]
*  Many of these newly minted suburban dads in Ohio who love Trump didn't delete their old tweets in Mandarin [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3234.22s)]
*  So, you know, it's not like the most sophisticated effort. So everyone stay vigilant out there [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3240.56s)]
*  don't fight with people on social media, but like this sounds like just an unfixable problem to me because [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3246.34s)]
*  You know if Alex Jones is gonna just share whatever like what who cares if it's from China or Russia or you know [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3251.7s)]
*  Just some weirdo. That's the nature of the information space. Now. You're gonna turn off this information [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3257.82s)]
*  You're gonna have to educate people about it. You're gonna have to give people context around it [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3261.8s)]
*  I think the couple things are interesting me about this [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3265.6600000000003s)]
*  It does feel like China's preference here if you look at the information space is for Trump to win, you know [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3270.1800000000003s)]
*  And and that may surprise some people because of the way Trump has talked about China and the trade war and everything [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3277.6600000000003s)]
*  But I think it makes sense the reason because Trump is a huge geopolitical opportunity for China, right the US is discredited [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3282.88s)]
*  We look ridiculous [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3290.2400000000002s)]
*  And you know, they kind of fill in the space that the US used to occupy in terms of creating their own world order [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3291.96s)]
*  So something to watch is just kind of what can we learn about the Chinese government's preferences through these information campaigns? [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3297.98s)]
*  and then the other thing is like this is pretty rudimentary stuff, right like guys with Twitter accounts, but [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3304.7200000000003s)]
*  A eyes coming, you know, and the Chinese have a lot of money invested in artificial intelligence [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3309.94s)]
*  so Tommy you're you know the deepfakes it, you know, we shared it could have a [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3315.26s)]
*  Like a Chinese address on them too. And so we should we should be mindful of that [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3322.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, this is gonna get worse before it gets better is basically the takeaway for me [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3325.9s)]
*  Ben's big news out of Turkey where president heir to one's party lost [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3330.62s)]
*  Key mayoral elections in five of Turkey's biggest cities including Istanbul where about a fifth of the population lives the opposition party [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3334.68s)]
*  They're the Republican People's Party. They had a great night according to Politico [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3341.8799999999997s)]
*  That they focus on economic factors [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3346.3999999999996s)]
*  They were able to defeat heir to ones largely like identity politics based campaign [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3348.7999999999997s)]
*  Who knows what that will mean for the future of heir to one's political party the AKP or for his political future? [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3353.2999999999997s)]
*  He said this would be his last election, but I think there's a lot of reasons to be [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3359.94s)]
*  Skeptical of that, but I don't know hopeful news here hopeful for the future democracy in Turkey, but any other takeaways from you [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3364.32s)]
*  it's hopeful and you know [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3370.1400000000003s)]
*  And I guess the thing to watch here is if everyone really is like in this process of maybe exiting the scene because he's also older [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3372.6800000000003s)]
*  It's just kind of interesting to see what fills that vacuum, you know, it can it stay within his party or you know [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3379.8s)]
*  You've got some good local officials getting elected in places like Istanbul [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3387.02s)]
*  Hopefully one of those people kind of emerges into a leader that can you know bring bring back a little more democracy to Turkey [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3391.1s)]
*  So it's a hopeful development worth watching but also it points to like, you know [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3399.16s)]
*  The next five ten years in Turkey you're gonna be very interesting politically because there could be a vacuum that opens up or or there [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3403.8599999999997s)]
*  Could be a positive transition. Yeah final story then cancel culture is striking again [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3409.7799999999997s)]
*  So John Hinckley jr. The man who attempted to assassinate president Ronald Reagan in 1981 [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3415.2799999999997s)]
*  He's very upset because he said that he had yet another musical performance cancelled [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3422.0s)]
*  Because of the aforementioned [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3428.0s)]
*  attempted assassination [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3430.48s)]
*  He spent 30 years in a mental institution after trying to kill Reagan [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3432.48s)]
*  He was found not guilty by reasons of insanity since his release in 2016 [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3438.06s)]
*  He has become a folk musician apparently he's got a bunch of followers on YouTube [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3442.56s)]
*  But the poor guy just can't seem to find a venue to allow him to perform live in front of an audience [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3447.6800000000003s)]
*  So, I don't know Ben, you know first the woke mob came for the failed assassins and I said nothing, you know [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3454.88s)]
*  It goes what's the event kid that was cancelled in Scotland? [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3461.1600000000003s)]
*  You know with the new law like oh, can you send him over there? Yeah, look [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3467.36s)]
*  I have to say like I [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3472.44s)]
*  Like folk music as much as the next guy like I'm not sure [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3474.92s)]
*  That what I'm thinking about like who I want to hear sing me a song like John Hinckley is not [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3478.4s)]
*  Exactly the person that comes to mind here, you know [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bQsDn2LP4&t=3484.84s)]
