Video Description: Tommy Vietor and Ben Rhodes discuss the escalation of violence between Israel and Hezbollah into all-out war, the shuttering of Al Jazeera in the West Bank, the importance and futility of the United Nations General Assembly, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s trip to the US with a “victory plan” and a swing state ammunition plant visit. Then they discuss new polling that reveals where American voters stand on foreign policy issues, another troubling local election in Germany with high turnout for the far-right, a Socialist candidate’s victory in Sri Lanka’s election, Elon Musk caving on free speech in Brazil, the potential national security implications of a sunken luxury yacht, a proposal in Albania to create a liberal Muslim micro-state, and painted dogs displayed as pandas in a Chinese zoo. Then, Ben speaks with Lebanese journalist and author of Black Wave, Kim Ghattas, about the situation on the ground in Beirut after the last week of pager attacks and strikes have caused panic, as well as the degree of damage to Hezbollah’s power.

# Israel Strikes Hezbollah Targets in Lebanon, Risking a 2nd All-Out War Almost a Year into Gaza War
**Pod Save the World:** [September 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4)
*  Welcome to Pod's Day of the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Ben Rhodes. Do you feel like you're better than me? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=0.0s)]
*  I do. I do feel better than you. Jets demolished the Patriots. Jets demolished the Patriots. The Mets are on the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=5.12s)]
*  doorstep of a playoff spot. I didn't leave it until... Steve Cohen, the owner of the Mets, is a huge asshole. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=11.96s)]
*  He's a terrible person. Yeah, but he's our asshole. Okay, I just wanted to make sure you know that. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=16.64s)]
*  Yeah, he's like a right-winger. Lashing back. Hurt people hurt people, Ben. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=19.44s)]
*  I'll take it. I'll take it. Like, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=23.92s)]
*  partisanship stops at the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=26.48s)]
*  diamond's edge. The diamond's edge. Yeah, but yeah, we did handle the Patriots pretty easily, I have to say. You guys are quite good. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=29.080000000000002s)]
*  We should just be Dodgers fans. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=35.44s)]
*  Ohtani. I mean, there's a world-wide angle there. Big time. Best player, like, maybe ever. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=38.4s)]
*  One of the best players in the history of baseball, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=43.68s)]
*  Shohei Ohtani. You guys don't know, he just entered the 50-50 club, which means 50 home runs and 50 stolen bases, and normally he pitches. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=45.8s)]
*  Yes. But he's not pitching this year because he's been injured. And he did it by going six for six with ten RBI's. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=52.96s)]
*  What the hell is going on? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=59.08s)]
*  It's like video game stats. I saw those stats and I was like, oh, is it double header? No, it's all in one game. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=61.08s)]
*  One game. Not a problem for him. What an absolute stud athlete. We won't talk about the gambling. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=64.84s)]
*  We got a great show for you today, Ben. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=69.2s)]
*  We're gonna talk about [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=71.04s)]
*  the major escalation in the war between Israel and Hezbollah and why Israel keeps shutting down Al Jazeera's offices across the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=72.36s)]
*  region. We're gonna talk about President Biden's speech at the UN General Assembly and what UNGA's value even is these days, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=79.48s)]
*  if there is any. We should just add, Tommy, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=86.2s)]
*  Road's Map, the latest addition to the Pods of the World YouTube channel. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=90.16000000000001s)]
*  Alona and I broke down the UN General Assembly. I know. I got a sweet in-line plug later. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=94.84s)]
*  Get some good feedback on the name Road's Map, which I did not come up with. I like that. Where'd that come from? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=99.80000000000001s)]
*  Where in the brainstorm? Is that an Alona special? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  There's no bad ideas in the brainstorm. Comedy Corner keeps turning out the hits. Road's Map, the Oslo. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=107.32000000000001s)]
*  Never mind. We're also gonna talk about Zelensky's visit to the US, his victory plan and his little swing state tour. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=114.36s)]
*  Yeah, I like that. Get him on a bus, get him hitting some doors. Also his choice words for JD Vance. I'd like that even more. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  Very choice. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=126.63999999999999s)]
*  We're also gonna get into a little more polling about national security. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=127.63999999999999s)]
*  Enjoyed that last week so much. We got some more data for you guys. Another worrisome election in Germany, a political sea change in Sri Lanka, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=131.76s)]
*  how Elon Musk ended up caving in Brazil, a super yacht full of classified information, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=138.72s)]
*  fun report of Albania that I know you're excited about. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=144.68s)]
*  Yeah, I'm very excited about this. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=147.4s)]
*  And then more zoo fraud. And then Ben, you did the interview today this morning. What did you talk about? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=148.4s)]
*  I talked to Kim Gaddis, who's a great journalist, a Lebanese journalist based in Beirut, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=153.28s)]
*  writes for the Financial Times and the Atlantic and other publications. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=159.36s)]
*  Kim talked about what is the mood like in Beirut and Lebanon generally, what precautions are people taking. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=162.76000000000002s)]
*  We talked about Hezbollah, the role they play in Lebanese politics and how they've been dealt a blow by Israel's recent operations. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=170.28s)]
*  But also kind of where is this going? Why is Israel doing this? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=177.6s)]
*  But you know, she called out I think some things we don't see in our media, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  which is what Israeli ministers are saying about like annexing southern Lebanon and all Lebanese being Hezbollah. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=185.0s)]
*  I mean, that was the education minister. I said all Lebanese are the same as Hezbollah. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=192.24s)]
*  Worrying echoes of the early Gaza days. And so it's a very sobering but very good interview. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=196.04000000000002s)]
*  People should check it out. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=201.88s)]
*  She's a real deal expert. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  Real deal. She's the real deal. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=203.88s)]
*  Definitely worth listening to. I'm excited to hear that. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  Well, let's start in Lebanon because it's just a huge story right now. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=207.88s)]
*  So the fighting has escalated. I saw this AP report. It's like, is it a full blown war? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=210.76000000000002s)]
*  It's like, what are you talking about? Of course it is. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=215.24s)]
*  How many bombs have to go off before it's a war? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=217.04000000000002s)]
*  There were hundreds of airstrikes this week. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=219.88s)]
*  The airstrikes in southern Lebanon by Israel killed more than 550 people, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=223.24s)]
*  according to Lebanon's health ministry, and injured more than 1600. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=227.44s)]
*  This was the deadliest day of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah since the 2006 war, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=230.72s)]
*  which no one would dispute was a major conflict. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=235.24s)]
*  The Israeli strikes come shortly after the very high profile Pager and Waki Taki sabotage attacks that we talked about last week. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=238.08s)]
*  Those were the operations by Israeli intelligence on Hezbollah operatives. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=244.72s)]
*  The IDF says now they are hitting Hezbollah infrastructure, leadership, weapons depots, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=249.07999999999998s)]
*  you know, like stockpiles of rockets, other military targets. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=254.44s)]
*  On Tuesday, the IDF said they killed a senior Hezbollah commander. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=258.44s)]
*  Last week, an airstrike in Beirut reportedly took out a bunch of senior commanders. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=261.88s)]
*  In Hezbollah's most elite fighter unit, the Radwan Commando Unit, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=266.28s)]
*  that's the unit that's trained to do a lot of cross-border operations into Israel. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=269.8s)]
*  That said, a lot of these strikes are in major population centers and have also killed civilians, including children. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=274.04s)]
*  You're going to hear much more about this situation on the ground from Ben and Kim in Beirut. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=279.6s)]
*  But Ben, it does just it feels like this is the beginning of something bigger. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=284.68s)]
*  I mean, you got Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu telling people in southern Lebanon to evacuate north. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=287.68s)]
*  He's saying things like we're preparing for the next phase of the conflict. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=293.24s)]
*  I assume that could include a ground operation. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=297.24s)]
*  Axios reported that Israeli and Western intelligence officials believe that Hezbollah has asked Iran to respond directly to Israel. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=300.12s)]
*  Luckily, that hasn't happened yet. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=307.32s)]
*  But the Pentagon has already announced they are sending what was described as a small number of additional US troops to the region on top of, I think, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=309.4s)]
*  40,000 who are already there, a couple of aircraft carriers, like serious hardware. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=317.12s)]
*  And so, Ben, you know, with the caveat that Israel and Hezbollah have been trading rocket attacks for the better part of the year. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=322.0s)]
*  In fact, I think Israel says Hezbollah has launched 900 rocket and drone attacks into Israel since October 7th of last year. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=329.64s)]
*  It seems like I mean, is it fair to say that this broader, you know, Biden international effort to avoid escalation has just completely failed at this point? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=336.96s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, Tommy, but by any measure, this has been a total failure of US policy, including, you know, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=346.32s)]
*  what they were saying publicly, urging de-escalation and avoiding precisely this outcome. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=352.96s)]
*  It's come to pass, you know, and the US just appears to be a completely passive actor. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=359.68s)]
*  I mean, the fact that we're sending aircraft carriers and once again insurgent to protect our own troops, you know, so let's keep in mind what the sequence is. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=368.4s)]
*  We urge Israel to not escalate a conflict in Lebanon because we know that it could lead to kind of regional war. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=377.56s)]
*  Israel completely ignores the United States, escalates without even telling us they're doing it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=385.68s)]
*  And so what? We then we rush military assets to protect our own people against what our allies doing over our objections. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=391.28s)]
*  It's just a bizarro world of of feckless policy, you know, constant escalation. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=400.12s)]
*  I mean, killing Hamas leaders in Tehran, this walkie talkie and pager assassination, the increased airstrikes. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=406.56s)]
*  I mean, it's a series of things, as you just pointed out. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=413.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And again, if we're not willing to use any leverage on the Israeli government and the Israeli government is willing to completely ignore every single thing that we tell them as the US government. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=415.64s)]
*  What are we doing here, guys? You know, I mean, I just I don't know what else to say. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=427.28s)]
*  Now, in terms of the dynamics on the ground, I mean, Israel is dealing huge blows to Hezbollah. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=430.88s)]
*  That is there's no question about that. But the question is, where does this go? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=436.64s)]
*  I mean, Hezbollah is not going to disappear like Hamas. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=440.79999999999995s)]
*  They're not going to come out and surrender. I have people I know who rightly point out, you know, there are 40,000 Israelis at least displaced from within Israel. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=443.88s)]
*  You know, that's unacceptable to a sovereign country. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=452.96s)]
*  Well, there are also tens of thousands of Lebanese displaced from southern Lebanon. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=455.84s)]
*  We never talk about them. I guess they're not people or something, you know, but they're they're they're displaced as well. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=459.32s)]
*  And do we think Hezbollah, those 40,000 people are going to be able to go home because Hezbollah people are being killed? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=465.4s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, you know, that would mean Hezbollah would have to essentially kind of admit defeat. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=473.0s)]
*  So I just don't know where this is going. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=477.92s)]
*  And if you combine this with what's happening in Gaza and what's happening in the West Bank, it's escalating everywhere. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=481.44s)]
*  Certainly in Lebanon and the West Bank, it's only not escalating Gaza because it's been a steady state of conflict. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=488.47999999999996s)]
*  And it's just where is this all going? Where does this all end? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=494.08s)]
*  Yeah. And just like I think you get into this with Kim a little more later, but just it's worth talking for a minute just about the broader political and economic situation in Lebanon, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=496.79999999999995s)]
*  because I think that context is important when you think about what the impact of this war could be on the Lebanese people, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=504.76s)]
*  because it's not an exaggeration to say that Lebanon is experiencing one of the worst economic collapses in history. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=510.4s)]
*  Like when you look at the IMF data, they defaulted on their debt in 2020 right at the start of the pandemic. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=517.16s)]
*  Later on that year, there was that massive explosion at the port in Beirut. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=521.96s)]
*  Their currency has lost 98 percent of its value. There's runaway inflation. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=526.8s)]
*  The banking sector is basically collapsed. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=530.6800000000001s)]
*  If you have money in the bank, you either can't get it out or what you get out is worth a fraction of what you put in because you're given the Lebanese lira. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=532.6s)]
*  And this financial crisis is just like impacted every part of life, health care, energy supplies, everything. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=541.5600000000001s)]
*  And so, like, yes, Hezbollah, it's a terrorist organization. They have a militant wing. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=547.96s)]
*  There's no love lost for those guys. Like they want Israel not to exist. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=552.36s)]
*  They want to kill civilians. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=555.52s)]
*  But they also do provide these social services, including medical care, food banks, welfare services. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=556.72s)]
*  They even started like a shadow economy and a shadow banking system to fill some of the void. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=562.28s)]
*  And like, again, no one's saying this is a good way to run a railroad. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=567.76s)]
*  I'm sure almost all this money is getting steered only to the Shia population. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=570.28s)]
*  But this war and like the further disruption of everything that's happening in Lebanon is going to impact everybody. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=574.8s)]
*  Well, that's yeah. And Kim makes this point that like it should also be emphasized that, you know, they're they're not the only health service in Lebanon. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=581.5999999999999s)]
*  That there's a complex, multidimensional Lebanese state. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=589.92s)]
*  And Hezbollah is a part of that. It's not all of that. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=595.0s)]
*  And she makes that point because this is a war on Lebanon. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=598.4s)]
*  You know, I mean, they can call it a war against Hezbollah, but the bombs are going off in the middle of Beirut. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=603.1999999999999s)]
*  The pager attacks, you know, targeted Hezbollah, but went off all across the country and that terrorized like the broader population as well. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=608.76s)]
*  And that's not my words. That's exactly how Kim described it. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=617.48s)]
*  Right. And you would think, you know, if things were blowing up all over Los Angeles, you wouldn't think that there was a war just against like some gang in Los Angeles. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=621.0s)]
*  So I make this point that to suggest that somehow there's not a broader cost, as you say, to the Lebanese people, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=630.68s)]
*  including a lot of people that don't like Hezbollah and aren't part of Hezbollah, is just to ignore what is happening in front of us. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=638.76s)]
*  You know, and how long can this go on where there's just this disregard for the civilian population that is caught up in the midst of these wars. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=644.9599999999999s)]
*  And every time you hear again about understandably, rightly, absolutely correctly about the civilian cost to these displaced Israeli citizens, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=657.56s)]
*  it's like, well, why is the logic applied there and not to civilians in places like Lebanon? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=667.8399999999999s)]
*  Lebanon in particular, they've just been subject to one tragedy after another. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=675.56s)]
*  And I start to wonder, too, like, how long can this war go on without the West Bank blowing up more or Jordan becoming unstable? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=682.1600000000001s)]
*  As their very large policy and population starts to ask, why is the Jordanian government not doing anything about this? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=692.4000000000001s)]
*  Or Egypt is a very brutal state. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=698.0s)]
*  I mean, we're just not we're living with the degree of risk in this kind of multifaceted, ever changing war that I think leads in dangerous directions. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=700.56s)]
*  Yeah. And that quote from the Israeli Ministry of Education was there is no difference between Hezbollah and Lebanon. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=713.3199999999999s)]
*  Lebanon will be annihilated. It will cease to exist. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=718.8s)]
*  Well, there you go. I mean, that's not me saying sometimes you say these things. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=721.16s)]
*  Be like, how dare you say that? Israel's at war with Lebanon. Well, listen to that. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=724.52s)]
*  These are people in the government. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=728.6s)]
*  And listen, Lebanon is also sheltering a couple of million Syrian refugees. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=730.4000000000001s)]
*  But just like it's not all Hezbollah. I mean, two thirds of Lebanon is Muslim. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=734.84s)]
*  It's basically half Sunni, half Shia. Thirty percent of the country is Christian. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=739.8800000000001s)]
*  Five percent of the country is Druze. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=743.6s)]
*  So there's a lot of people in there that probably really hate Hezbollah. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=745.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, and they're suffering, too, because of this war. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=747.96s)]
*  And the previous, you know, the 1982 Israeli military invasion of Lebanon helped kind of fuel what became, you know, seemingly endless of a war. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=750.4s)]
*  The 2006 war did not go well for anybody like these wars. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=759.84s)]
*  You know, again, you can degrade Hezbollah's capability. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=763.96s)]
*  You can kill a bunch of the leaders, but they don't solve the problem. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=766.16s)]
*  I mean, I don't know how many times we have to learn this. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=770.52s)]
*  Yeah. Another thing we just want to flag, and you mentioned the West Bank earlier, Ben. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=772.36s)]
*  So on Sunday, the IDF raided and shut down the office of Al Jazeera in the West Bank. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=775.64s)]
*  He the Israeli government said that they're ordered to be closed for 45 days. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=781.0s)]
*  The this was on the order of the military, which had determined that the office was being used to incite terror in some way. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=786.0s)]
*  We should note that Al Jazeera operates in part of the West Bank referred to as area A, which is supposed to be under full Palestinian control. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=792.84s)]
*  So this is a pretty surprising move by the Israelis. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=800.1600000000001s)]
*  Back in May, the Israeli government passed a law that allowed the government to shut down foreign media outlets that are deemed a national security threat. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=803.04s)]
*  The shutdowns are supposed to last 44 days, but they can be renewed and they have been renewed. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=810.4s)]
*  But after this law passed, I mean, Israeli authorities quickly moved on. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=815.44s)]
*  It's called the Al Jazeera law in Israel, and they moved to shut down Al Jazeera's offices in eastern Jerusalem. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=819.16s)]
*  So, I mean, I think, you know, the world is losing a major source of reporting on Gaza, the West Bank, the cause, the conflict generally. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=824.12s)]
*  And also, it's important to note, just for context, that Israel all but bans international journalists from entering the Gaza Strip to cover it there. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=831.44s)]
*  If you get in, you're basically you're pre-approved or with a minder. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=840.24s)]
*  You're escorted around with some like IDF unit. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=844.7600000000001s)]
*  So I don't know then when like Vladimir Putin or Viktor Orban or Nicholas Maduro does stuff like this. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=847.44s)]
*  The response is pretty unequivocal. I tried to look around. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=853.9200000000001s)]
*  I didn't read every State Department briefing, but I've not heard as much from the US on this one. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=857.32s)]
*  No, and there's just there's no credible reason. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=862.6800000000001s)]
*  You know, they talk about incitement. I mean, Al Jazeera, they may not like their editorial line, but there are journalists against me that's been reporting on what's going on there. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=865.1600000000001s)]
*  We've seen journalists killed in the West Bank, including Shireen Abadi, an American journalist for Al Jazeera. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=872.96s)]
*  But your point is the right one about Gaza. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=879.5200000000001s)]
*  Like if again, if there's a if there's a commitment to the freedom of the press and B, if there's not, you know, war crimes being committed, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=881.28s)]
*  why are we almost a year into this war and no journalist is allowed to just go reporting Gaza? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=890.92s)]
*  Not even allowed to go in there. And they're shutting down media outlets in the West Bank. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=895.68s)]
*  If you don't want people to see what's going on, it's a pretty good indication that there's something that should be reported on. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=902.0799999999999s)]
*  But it's getting increasingly difficult to actually get on the ground in these places. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=908.08s)]
*  Yeah. Well, unfortunately, I think it's the last time we're talking about this. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=913.5600000000001s)]
*  But let's turn to Anga, then, because unfortunately for all New Yorkers, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=917.08s)]
*  leaders and delegations from over one hundred and fifty countries are in New York for the UN General Assembly. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=922.0s)]
*  Zelensky and Biden, I think both already spoke today. Netanyahu was scheduled to speak later, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=927.44s)]
*  although he delayed his trip, I think, at one point because of this Hezbollah operation. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=931.88s)]
*  So I'm not sure what his deal is. But either way, it's going to be a showcase of every conflict and rift and crisis happening in the world, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=935.92s)]
*  as well as the inability for the UN to fix them. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=941.8s)]
*  Even the UN secretary general has admitted that the UN Security Council has been a failure and has done nothing to stop the wars in Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=946.0s)]
*  So in terms of the UN itself, then, heading into Anga this year, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=953.72s)]
*  the US proposed adding two new permanent seats for African countries and a non-permanent seat for small island developing nations. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=959.52s)]
*  That's sort of an interesting attempt at reforming the institution. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=966.68s)]
*  Although I did see that our ambassador, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said that the US opposes giving those African countries veto power [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=970.0s)]
*  because the veto is what makes the UN Security Council so dysfunctional. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=977.8s)]
*  So we'll see if this proposal goes anywhere. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=981.0799999999999s)]
*  Biden's speech, as you know better than anyone, as Anga's speeches often do, is tour of the region. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=984.12s)]
*  Yes, tour of the horizon. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=989.84s)]
*  You're talking about a lot of stuff briefly. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=991.88s)]
*  But, you know, so he hit on Ukraine, Gaza, Hezbollah, you know, a lot of different stuff. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=994.1600000000001s)]
*  But there was also kind of a personal element that was interesting from Biden about his own sort of political fortune and changes lately. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1000.9200000000001s)]
*  Let's hear a clip. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1008.5600000000001s)]
*  Being president has been the honor of my life. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1009.6800000000001s)]
*  There's so much more I want to get done. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1013.24s)]
*  As much as I love the job, I love my country more. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1015.8s)]
*  I decided after 50 years of public service, it's time for a new generation of leadership to take my nation forward. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1020.64s)]
*  My fellow leaders, let us never forget, some things are more important than staying in power. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1028.6s)]
*  It's your people. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1036.48s)]
*  It's your people that matter the most. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1043.16s)]
*  Never forget, we are here to serve the people, not the other way around. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1046.16s)]
*  So I know Biden said some of that stuff before, but I do think in that room, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1051.92s)]
*  yeah, a bunch of people who are willing to like tear up their own constitution at times to cling to power is pretty powerful. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1055.96s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, the first part is like the exact verbatim that we heard, you know, but then that line, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1061.64s)]
*  that he used that was, I think, specific to the room, right, about giving up power, the line that do the applause, you know, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1067.32s)]
*  we have to bear in mind that most of the people sitting in that audience, or at least a lot of them, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1075.08s)]
*  are not in a position where they have an interest in giving up power whatsoever. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1079.72s)]
*  And, you know, I think it's a reminder that for all the dysfunction in the world, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1083.8s)]
*  in all the dysfunction in our politics and all the kind of autocratic tendencies that we have on display, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1090.28s)]
*  that there's still something that the United States can offer the world that is positive, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1096.28s)]
*  which is the example of a peaceful transition of power. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1102.4399999999998s)]
*  If Kamala Harris wins the example of a generational transition of power, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1105.56s)]
*  the example of a multi-united power, the example of a multi-national power, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1110.52s)]
*  the example of a generational transition of power, the example of a multi-racial candidate [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1115.88s)]
*  and the first female president getting elected, that we can still show the world like a better story, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1120.76s)]
*  not just about ourselves, but about how politics can function. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1127.64s)]
*  And so I think that was, you know, really a powerful statement at a time when, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1131.8s)]
*  you know, democracy is moving in the wrong direction in so many places. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1136.1200000000001s)]
*  You know, he's kind of planning a really important blog there about, you know, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1139.56s)]
*  the imperative in any democratic society of people being willing to relinquish power. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1146.04s)]
*  Yeah. I think we're so close to all of this just happening that we're going to remember [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1152.04s)]
*  kind of the role pressure played and Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1155.64s)]
*  Pots of America. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1159.88s)]
*  Yeah. But just such an arrogant self-important podcaster. But I do think like, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1159.96s)]
*  when history kind of pulls back on this moment, it will be a pretty profound example of, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1164.36s)]
*  you know, resetting after January 6th. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1169.16s)]
*  No, look, and we're living through an historical epic, right? And if we come out of it, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1170.84s)]
*  you know, which I hope we will, knock on wood, you know, I think we'll look back. And when you're [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1176.6799999999998s)]
*  looking at the moments that helps kind of keep things moving forward or kept democracy alive, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1181.1599999999999s)]
*  like the Joe Biden decision to step aside, you know, will feature on that list again. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1187.48s)]
*  And he was, he himself was the first to acknowledge that if Kamala Harris wins, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1192.9199999999998s)]
*  you know, it'll look a certain way in a year. And if he loses, you know, if she loses, it won't. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1198.04s)]
*  So, but yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think to the rest of the world, that's a very unusual thing [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1202.6799999999998s)]
*  that he did. Yeah. I don't know. Do you make anything of these UN Security Council resolution [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1207.72s)]
*  kind of tweaks that the US has put forward or like David Miliband suggesting suspending the UN [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1213.32s)]
*  Security Council resolution veto powers during a conflict, which kind of raises the question, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1219.72s)]
*  when are we not in the conflict? But I don't know, like all these different tweaks or changes [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1224.04s)]
*  to the UN system to make it work better. Because like part of me wanted to walk in here and make [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1227.56s)]
*  fun of it with you and be like, why the hell do we even go anymore? It's useless. But then I imagine [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1231.48s)]
*  a scenario where Trump wins reelection, he just stopped showing up and clearly that would be worse. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1235.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. No. And we talked about this on Road's Map. But I think it's a positive thing to offer [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1239.96s)]
*  this reform. The US has tried to take steps in recent years to increase representation, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1247.8799999999999s)]
*  particularly from Africa on different international institutions. So I think they [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1252.92s)]
*  brought the AU, the African Union into the G20 as a kind of permanent member of that enterprise. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1257.88s)]
*  And this has long been a complaint among developing countries that they're not [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1266.2s)]
*  represented on the Security Council. In the Obama years, we actually came out in favor of India [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1270.04s)]
*  having a permanency. Right. Yeah. So this is, reform kind of never happens, but it's worth [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1274.28s)]
*  trying and it's worth putting this out. What is striking is these are clearly geopolitical [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1280.28s)]
*  interests, right? The Pacific Island states and Africa are kind of venues for this competition [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1284.6s)]
*  between the US and China. And here's the US trying to show, hey, look, we want to evolve the [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1288.92s)]
*  international system to be more representative. It's going to take more work to actually implement [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1292.6s)]
*  anything without Security Council reform more broadly in terms of how the veto works. It's [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1297.0s)]
*  not going to solve the dysfunction because you can have all the new members you want. But if [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1304.12s)]
*  essentially the great powers are at odds and you're using their vetoes to obstruct any action on [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1308.68s)]
*  big geopolitical issues, the Security Council matters less. So I'd love to see a real meaningful [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1313.16s)]
*  reform of the UN system and the UN Security Council, but absent the great powers agreeing, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1319.96s)]
*  you're not going to get there. So a lot of these proposals kind of have more of a messaging [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1325.16s)]
*  function than anything else. Yeah. Yeah. Well said. Last quick thing on this. So I think I [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1330.8400000000001s)]
*  noticed that both Biden and Kamala Harris met with Mohammed bin Zayed or Mbz, president of the UAE, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1334.6s)]
*  who is making the first visit by an Emirati president to the US since 1971. I know that [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1341.0s)]
*  there was a very extensive readout that went out from the White House. Thank you, NSC team for all [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1346.6s)]
*  that good stuff. But Sudan was mentioned, I hope they pushed him really fucking hard about stopping [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1352.6s)]
*  weapons sales to the RSF, the paramilitary force in Sudan. That is one half of the civil war that's [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1359.0s)]
*  leading to the worst famine on the globe right now. I saw there was a great letter from five [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1366.92s)]
*  Democrats, Pramila Jaya, Paul, Barbara Lee, Sarah Jacobs, Ilhan Omar, and Dan Kildee calling on [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1370.92s)]
*  Biden to raise the support of the RSF by the UAE, but let's just hope it came up. I'm sure it came [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1376.52s)]
*  up. I mean, the question is like, you know, how hard this was pushed. And I have to say, like, I [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1382.84s)]
*  don't, I genuinely don't understand why the UAE is so compelled to be doing this. I just don't. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1387.48s)]
*  I don't either. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1394.92s)]
*  I'm sure that they have some kind of corrupt interests there. There's oil in Sudan, or [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1395.4s)]
*  there's relationships that they built up with the RSF and Yemen and places like that. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1399.88s)]
*  But there's a reputational cost to the UAE. I mean, this is not a, you know, this is now like [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1403.8s)]
*  widely known, this support for the RSF and how it's contributing to the crisis. And so part of the [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1409.72s)]
*  message has to be this is in your interest. Your interest is not to kind of be seen as this [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1414.6799999999998s)]
*  kind of supporter of this pariah militia committing genocide, acts of violence in Sudan. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1420.1999999999998s)]
*  Hopefully that message gets through and we can see a shift. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1424.84s)]
*  Yeah. Do you want to get a table at Cafe Milano? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1427.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1429.0s)]
*  Well, because you're not going to be welcome to official Washington. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1429.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't know. They'll always get the table at Cafe Milano. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1431.56s)]
*  They'll buy the whole restaurant. Also, Ben, so we mentioned before, Zelensky is in the U.S. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1433.8799999999999s)]
*  He says he's bringing a victory plan. He's not going to talk about the specifics of it publicly [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1438.36s)]
*  until he's discussed it with Biden. But he did sort of get asked about this in an ABC interview [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1443.4s)]
*  that aired on Monday. Here's a clip from that. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1448.52s)]
*  Your victory plan. Does it include? I know you don't want to get into [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1450.6000000000001s)]
*  into details until you talk to the leaders, but negotiating with Russia and how can you trust [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1455.88s)]
*  someone? It's not about negotiation with Russia. No, it's about, like I said, it's a bridge to [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1462.6000000000001s)]
*  diplomatic way how to stop the war. The bridge is a plan of victory or victorious plan. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1470.1200000000001s)]
*  It's a strengthening of Ukraine, Ukrainian army and Ukrainian people only in the strong position. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1476.3600000000001s)]
*  We can push. We can push Putin to stop the war diplomatic way. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1483.16s)]
*  So I'm guessing it'll have a bunch of the previous asks like we want to hit, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1490.2s)]
*  use Western weapons, hit targets in Russia, ongoing military support over some 10-year [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1494.76s)]
*  horizon or something, a pathway into the EU, pathway into NATO. Zelensky also is going to [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1499.8s)]
*  brief members of Congress and the Harris and Trump campaigns on the plan. The Trump meeting [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1505.16s)]
*  will be fun after Zelensky took a big whack at JD Vance and the New Yorker. He's also, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1509.3200000000002s)]
*  I think he already spoke to the UN General Assembly. But Ben, what really caught my eye [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1514.8400000000001s)]
*  about Zelensky's visit was he took a trip to Scranton, Pennsylvania to visit an ammunition [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1518.04s)]
*  factory that makes 155 millimeter artillery shells. Those shells are used in the howitzer [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1523.88s)]
*  artillery system that's been critical for the Ukrainian military to help fight back against [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1529.0800000000002s)]
*  the Russians. Zelensky took a 90-minute tour along with Governor Josh Shapiro and Senator Bob Casey. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1533.88s)]
*  No press was allowed, but they released a video of Shapiro and Zelensky signing some shell casings [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1539.4s)]
*  afterwards and thanking workers. Here's a brief clip. You said that 400 people work here, but I [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1545.16s)]
*  wanted very much to come here and to thank you. 400 people saved millions of Ukrainians [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1550.68s)]
*  because of the result of your work. I'm very thankful just from ordinary Ukrainians to you. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1557.5600000000002s)]
*  And what can I say? Thank you so much. You helped us to survive against Putin invasion. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1563.88s)]
*  What do you think of this Swing State tour? Like savvy, strange, too cute? Like I can't really decide. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1570.04s)]
*  I love this Swing State tour. Yeah, I love it. I mean, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1576.44s)]
*  get them on a bus. Yeah, get them on the bus tour. I will say, I mean, first on the victory plan, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1578.6s)]
*  Zelensky is clearly trying to set up a kind of situation in which they know they may not [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1585.8s)]
*  reclaim every inch of territory, but there's a kind of psychological victory that can be won. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1590.1999999999998s)]
*  And it clearly doesn't involve escalation against Russia, letting them use those longer range [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1595.1599999999999s)]
*  weapons and just kind of getting a sense of an advantage that they want to be in a stronger [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1600.84s)]
*  position heading into some negotiations. And they want to come out of it stronger because of [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1606.44s)]
*  security assurances, because of EU membership and things like this. So he's making a bit of a turn, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1611.0800000000002s)]
*  but it's still very much on Ukraine's terms, which you'd expect from him. I think on Pennsylvania, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1615.88s)]
*  look, he's doing a couple of things. One, separate from the election, I mean, just highlighting the [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1620.92s)]
*  fact that the money that is appropriated by Congress in these supplemental bills for Ukraine, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1625.48s)]
*  genuinely goes to support jobs in the US. That's a smart message. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1630.76s)]
*  Three cheers for the military industrial complex. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1636.0400000000002s)]
*  All of a sudden a bunch of liberals are cheering the military industrial complex. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1638.6000000000001s)]
*  Artillery shells. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1642.2800000000002s)]
*  Get some rate down factories open. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1643.16s)]
*  And then on the swing state piece and the shot he took at JD Vance, we called him a radical. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1646.6000000000001s)]
*  People want me to read a quote? [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1651.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1652.68s)]
*  Let Mr. Vance read up on the history of the Second World War when a country was forced to [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1653.0800000000002s)]
*  give part of its territory to one particular person, Zelensky said. What did that man do? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1656.44s)]
*  Was he appeased or did he deal a devastating blow to the continent of Europe, to many nations [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1660.8400000000001s)]
*  broadly and to the Jewish nation in particular? Let him do some reading. That's a shot. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1664.6s)]
*  I mean, he could have added that one of us looks better with a beard than the other. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1670.9199999999998s)]
*  It might have been, comma, you dumb fuck. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1675.24s)]
*  You asshole. He could have added like a couch joke by the way, so savage. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1677.48s)]
*  But the reality is it, like if you're Zelensky, like this guy ran out of fucks like a long time [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1682.76s)]
*  ago. And so there's, oh, what's he doing in swing states? Well, you know what? He's helping his [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1688.84s)]
*  country. I kind of like it. It's like, and he's not like endorsing Kamala Harris. He's not like [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1693.24s)]
*  he's doing message events. Well, it kind of is. He was nice to Trump in this interview. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1698.2s)]
*  He was nice to Trump in the interview too. But I mean, I don't know. I think his thought with [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1702.44s)]
*  Trump is, look, first of all, Trump may like it more for taking the shot at JD Vance. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1708.28s)]
*  Like Trump kind of respects. I mean, seriously, Trump respects kind of strong men who say ominous, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1714.28s)]
*  threatening things about people. And so I actually don't think the dancing hurts him [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1721.56s)]
*  with Trump. And I think as long as his view is public, you know what? I clearly [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1726.52s)]
*  prefer the Democrats to win my thumbs on the scale a little bit in that direction. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1730.84s)]
*  And if Trump wins, I'm just going to have to deal with it. And I'll try to deal with it in my own [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1735.3999999999999s)]
*  kind of strong man, Ukrainian way. I'll cross that bridge if I have to, but I'd obviously [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1739.96s)]
*  prefer these people over here are in power. Now I will say JD, you're PNGed preemptively. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1745.1599999999999s)]
*  JD, yeah, you're not coming to the, you're not coming to Kiev in the train anytime soon. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1751.16s)]
*  But the thing I don't get, Tommy, if you were the Harris campaign, I mean, maybe this is too [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1756.1200000000001s)]
*  world over me, but given how tight these margins are going to be, why is she not doing diaspora [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1763.64s)]
*  events? Not just the weapons factory like this one, but like they're large, not just Ukrainian [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1769.72s)]
*  diaspora, but Polish diaspora, Eastern European diaspora. And these are people that are white, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1775.3999999999999s)]
*  skew Republican, but probably really hate Trump's Russia policy. I mean, do you think there's space [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1783.08s)]
*  for her to get out or Waltz and do some of these kinds of engagements in Pennsylvania, [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1789.56s)]
*  Michigan, Wisconsin? Yeah, get some good circuits out there. Get some, you know, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1793.72s)]
*  it's a big, you know, Polish national security type. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1797.88s)]
*  Was he big? But I don't know. I just, I think it's worth, I honestly think it's worth, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1801.5600000000002s)]
*  there's a younger Brzezinski, he was the ambassador to Poland. Yeah, Mark Brzezinski, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1807.64s)]
*  Mark Brzezinski, a good guy. Like, but I honestly think that like, this is worth the, you know, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1810.92s)]
*  one of the top two people doing something because these people care a lot and they'll, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1816.0400000000002s)]
*  the, you know, this is like a voting issue for them. I agree. Yeah. Well, let's talk about, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1821.24s)]
*  let's talk about the politics. I mean, because normally the secret is like, you know, you send [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1825.24s)]
*  like Timothy Schneider or something. It's not like, I mean, it's great, but it's not like, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1828.28s)]
*  you know, moving votes, you know? I think, yeah, I'm not, I think Walls is probably going to get [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1833.16s)]
*  through the debate and then do a lot more interviews, events and things, but they're just [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1839.72s)]
*  kind of waiting to get through October 1st. But yeah, I think there's room to do a lot more all [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1844.52s)]
*  over the place, I think. Well, let's talk about the politics. We have this more good polling. So [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1848.44s)]
*  this time we got a poll from the Institute for Global Affairs. Not as good as the National [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1852.8400000000001s)]
*  Security Action Poll. Well, I wanted to clarify that too. This polling was featured exclusively. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1856.8400000000001s)]
*  It's like Bad Nate. No, what a day. I've had a bunch of people email me like, who's Bad Nate? [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1862.2800000000002s)]
*  Whichever one's most recent poll I liked. That's good, Nate. So the What a Day newsletter, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1867.64s)]
*  which if you're not subscribed, subscribe, because it's an excellent newsletter. They had this [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1873.3200000000002s)]
*  exclusively on Monday. But basically this this organization, Institute for Global Affairs, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1877.0s)]
*  polled about 2000 Americans on foreign policy issues. They did some sub samples where they [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1881.24s)]
*  dug into like Rust Belt, Swing States, etc. But big picture. On Israel and Gaza, then, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1885.8s)]
*  majorities of both Democrats and independents think the US should either end support for Israel's war [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1891.56s)]
*  effort or make that support conditional on a ceasefire. Good to know. 42% of Republicans [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1896.84s)]
*  think the US should support Israel unconditionally, but Democrats, for Democrats, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1903.0s)]
*  that number drops to 8%. On just sort of a national level, Harris is viewed as stronger [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1907.24s)]
*  than Trump on improving Washington's reputation on the world stage, being a strong leader and [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1912.44s)]
*  avoiding sending American troops into unnecessary conflicts, but only barely on that last one or [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1917.16s)]
*  last two. But Trump does better on who's more likely to reform immigration and the wars in [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1922.2s)]
*  Gaza and Ukraine and respond effectively to attack on Taiwan. You'll like this, Ben. 66% [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1928.44s)]
*  of Democrats and 45% of Republicans think the US should normalize relations with Cuba. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1934.8400000000001s)]
*  All right. Here we go. Just get Florida out of this conversation. Democrats say their top [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1939.4s)]
*  foreign policy issues are climate change. Republicans say their top issue, sorry, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1943.72s)]
*  issue singular is immigration. I would personally argue that neither of those issues is just like a [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1948.2s)]
*  purely foreign policy, but kind of interesting that it popped. Two thirds of voters want to see [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1953.0800000000002s)]
*  NATO and the US push for a negotiated settlement of the war in Ukraine. 58% of Harris supporters [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1957.64s)]
*  think the US should maintain or increase the number of US troops overseas, while 58% of Trump [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1963.3200000000002s)]
*  supporters would like to see a decrease in the number of troops abroad. So bombarding you with [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1968.0400000000002s)]
*  stats there. Lots of more interesting stuff, though. I do think there's a few warning signs [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1973.0s)]
*  for Democrats in there. Stuff we talk about a lot, like Ukraine threats to democracy internationally [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1976.2s)]
*  were rated very low on the list of priorities people said they cared about. But I don't know, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1982.12s)]
*  anything jump out at you in this survey? I think what jumps out in all these surveys in a way is [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1987.7199999999998s)]
*  the kind of tribal identity politics that we see in every issue has kind of completely crept into [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=1996.12s)]
*  foreign policy. So immigration is a right-wing issue and climate change is this. If you want [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2002.52s)]
*  to fight climate change, you also want to help Ukraine. These are things that didn't [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2010.04s)]
*  used to correlate, but the kind of sorting that's taken place is kind of replicated on foreign policy. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2013.6399999999999s)]
*  So that I think stands out. I think the gap between public opinion on issues like Israel [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2021.8s)]
*  and Cuba and politicians kind of just continues to be glaring. And that's I think in part because [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2030.68s)]
*  interest groups are more powerful than public opinion on those issues. Really? So in Cuba? [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2038.12s)]
*  Who is pushing for that? Is just Florida politics? And it's the number of members of Congress who [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2043.1599999999999s)]
*  care about it. The anti-Cuban hardliners care a lot. So like Marco Rubio, he's going to grind [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2050.68s)]
*  the Senate to a halt over it or something. And other people need to care more about changing it. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2059.4s)]
*  And the same thing is true of Israel policy. But that uncomfortable gap between public opinion and [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2064.44s)]
*  policy is clear. And then the last thing I'd say in time, I know what you think about this is that [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2073.08s)]
*  ending the war in Ukraine and Gaza being in advantage for Trump, I get why Trump would end [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2079.32s)]
*  the war faster in Ukraine by essentially cutting them off. But I think that should be more worrying [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2087.16s)]
*  to Democrats. This idea that we're kind of the permanent war, military, industrial complex, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2093.24s)]
*  globalization party. I'm not comfortable being associated with that. Even though I want to [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2098.4399999999996s)]
*  support Ukraine, but when you paint a broad brush, it just kind of looks like we're constantly [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2105.4799999999996s)]
*  defending a status quo that people don't like. They don't like globalization. They don't like [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2110.2s)]
*  wars. They don't like all this chaos around the world. And we got to take that seriously. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2115.0s)]
*  But God forbid we lose this election. I hope not. But if we do, I think one of the things we'll be [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2122.04s)]
*  looking back on is why do we keep defending all these status quos that people are pissed about? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2127.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. I was fighting with a member of Congress about this today, who's a pretty firm defender [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2134.2799999999997s)]
*  of the Biden policy in Israel and not of Netanyahu, but of like kind of Golan. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2139.3999999999996s)]
*  Wait a second. How can you be a defender of the Biden policy and not be a defender of Netanyahu? [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2144.04s)]
*  I know he wouldn't say it that way, but- Fair point. But I sent this political story with [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2148.6000000000004s)]
*  the headline, US sending small number of troops to Middle East as attacks ramp up. I'm like, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2154.52s)]
*  this is a bad fucking headline for Kamala Harris and Democrats because what people don't want across [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2158.28s)]
*  the political spectrum is more money for wars and more chaos on their TVs. And not that they read [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2164.6000000000004s)]
*  the newspaper, but their social media feeds and just the feeling of insecurity that comes from [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2170.84s)]
*  being bombarded with scary events overseas that are tied to us and threats and terrorism. This [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2176.92s)]
*  is not a good setup. Yeah. And just politically, because you, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2182.2000000000003s)]
*  Biden administration or Democrat party, were uncomfortable having the fight that would [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2187.16s)]
*  inevitably emerge if you try to use leverage back in the spring, or the winter or the fall, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2194.92s)]
*  and saying we're going to condition military assistance. Because you didn't want to have that [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2200.28s)]
*  political problem. You now have the political problem of five weeks before an election of [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2204.92s)]
*  headlines about US forces potentially getting a war in the Middle East, which is, I can guarantee [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2209.8s)]
*  you, far more consequential to voters than whether there's some criticisms of you holding up 2000 [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2214.6800000000003s)]
*  pound bomb weapons shipments to Israel. And God forbid we actually end up in that conflict. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2221.64s)]
*  I mean, this is not the October you want. I'm sure it wasn't the UNGA speech that President Biden [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2227.4s)]
*  wanted. He wanted to kind of herald his accomplishments. I'm sure that may have [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2234.04s)]
*  something to do with Bibi Nino's timing. And we just have to be aware of that. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2237.72s)]
*  Yeah. And just to check us on our bullshit for a second. Check our bullshit. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2241.96s)]
*  We are worldos. We're very seized with this stuff. There was a huge conversation about [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2246.36s)]
*  Gaza and campus politics and how animated young people were by this. The Harvard Institute just [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2251.16s)]
*  came out today with its youth poll. They looked at top issues for 18 to 29 year olds. The top was [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2256.68s)]
*  the economy at 14%. Israel-Palestine barely rated with 1%. So this is, it's seemingly, I don't know [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2262.92s)]
*  if it's always been the case or if it's dropped from the headlines. So therefore it's sort of [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2270.44s)]
*  like dropped in salience among voters. It's not like a huge animating issue in the electorate [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2273.7200000000003s)]
*  broadly. Maybe there are several tens of thousands of voters in Michigan, for example, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2279.88s)]
*  who voted uncommitted, who will stay home, who could tip the election from Harris to Biden. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2285.8s)]
*  I'm not saying it's irrelevant. I think everything matters in this election. But I think [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2291.24s)]
*  you're making a broader point. I'm making a broader point about war and spending money on wars and [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2294.68s)]
*  scary images overseas and that being a thing that politically could move the needle on the cusp of [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2300.7599999999998s)]
*  an election. And I just think you're right. You should not overstate how much people care about [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2307.0s)]
*  an issue like Gaza. I think politically that issue is really a Michigan issue where the margins are [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2313.0s)]
*  small. So if enough people care, it's probably. I think more broadly though, the thing I'd add to [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2318.68s)]
*  your point about war, Tommy, is also just like non-responsive elites. And this is where the [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2323.16s)]
*  Israel piece comes into it. It's like people clearly do not think it is a good idea to provide [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2329.8799999999997s)]
*  billions and billions and billions of unconditioned military assistance to Israel. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2335.3999999999996s)]
*  And politicians ignore that sentiment. And that happens a lot on foreign policy. And so to me, [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2339.96s)]
*  the Israel question kind of rolls into this bigger question of like, if I'm looking at the [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2347.48s)]
*  US government, I'm wondering, there's something cynical about it. We say one thing and we're [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2351.48s)]
*  doing another thing. We say we want this war to stop, but we give the weapons for it. But also [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2357.2400000000002s)]
*  just sense of like, in foreign policy in particular, why is nobody listening to what people think? [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2361.96s)]
*  Also, are we in charge? Do we have any sway? We can't make this end? Why not? Anyway. All right, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2367.56s)]
*  a lot of that. Let's do another quick Germany update, Ben. A couple of weeks ago, we talked [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2373.32s)]
*  about two state elections in Germany, where the far right AFD party did way too well for comfort. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2377.56s)]
*  They got the most votes in a state called Thuringia and got a close second in Saxony. Now we have one [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2382.92s)]
*  more set of local elections out of Brandenburg, one of my favorite gates, which is the area [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2388.6000000000004s)]
*  surrounding Berlin. So there the Social Democrats or SPD party, they barely squeaked by to win with [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2393.6400000000003s)]
*  30.9% of the vote while the AFD, the far right party, the neo Nazi party got 29.2%. So in absolute [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2399.64s)]
*  terms, it's obviously good the AFD didn't win. But Brandenburg has been a stronghold for Social [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2406.12s)]
*  Democrats for decades, like since like 1990. So a loss there would have been catastrophic and [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2411.0s)]
*  probably would have led for calls for Olaf Scholz to resign or step aside or not run again, at least. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2417.08s)]
*  Scholz is still in some political trouble, however, he is so unpopular that local SPD members [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2422.8399999999997s)]
*  asked him not to campaign in Brandenburg. I think he lives there too. And exit polls said that 75% [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2427.96s)]
*  of SPD voters were actually just voting against the AFD. They didn't want to see a strong far right. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2434.28s)]
*  So listeners might be asking, why are you guys talking about local German elections so much? We [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2439.48s)]
*  don't care. The answer is whenever there's a neo Nazi party ascendant in Germany, we pledge to you [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2444.28s)]
*  that we're going to talk about it. And there's a national election next September. So keep an eye [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2449.96s)]
*  on this one. Yeah, I think German politics is kind of the next big bellwether of where the momentum [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2453.96s)]
*  is with the far right. And clearly, there's you know, at a minimum, this level of performance by [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2459.48s)]
*  the AFD is going to make every coalition formation difficult at the state level, at the federal level, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2467.4s)]
*  after the next election. It bears watching. It remains concerning. As you pointed out last week, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2473.48s)]
*  too, the AFD is not even some reconstructed far right party. They're not even doing the kind of [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2478.92s)]
*  Georgia Maloney, look at us, we're more centrist now. This is not good. Bad news. New Yorker had a good [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2483.3999999999996s)]
*  piece last week. It was titled The Complicated Rise of the Right in Germany's Left Behind Places. It [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2490.2s)]
*  was very good if you want more. All right, Ben, now we're going to turn to a country where the [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2496.04s)]
*  pronunciations are going to tax me. I think listeners of this show know. I've been most excited for this [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2502.6s)]
*  segment all day. I think we're going to have to promise to do cuts because we can't go this long. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2507.72s)]
*  But I just want you all to know that I am equal opportunity when it comes to just failing to [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2512.76s)]
*  pronounce words. It could be English, it could be Spanish, it could be Sri Lankan. I'm just bad at [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2517.88s)]
*  it. So here's what you need to know. Three main contenders. Ben's looking at me like enjoying [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2522.76s)]
*  this. So there's 38 presidential candidates. They duked it out in the election over the weekend. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2528.0400000000004s)]
*  The Marxist candidate, Anura Kumara Desanaeke, came out on top in the second round with about [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2533.2400000000002s)]
*  56% of the vote. His next closest opponent, who is the son of the former president, actually got 44%. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2538.52s)]
*  This is a big shakeup in Sri Lankan politics, which has been kind of run by the old guard for [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2545.4s)]
*  a lot of its history. Turnout was very high. They had 80% turnout. AKD, so we're going to call him [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2550.68s)]
*  AKD to just spare me here. So he represents the Leftist National People's Power Coalition, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2556.84s)]
*  which is party JVP. It's the largest member. JVP has this kind of interesting violent history. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2562.12s)]
*  They were involved in failed uprisings in the 70s and 80s, and he's been the leader of the party [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2568.52s)]
*  for 10 years. Ran for president in 2019, but just got 3% of the vote back then. But as a lot has [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2572.92s)]
*  changed since 2019. Ben, I remember loving this story with you when in 2022 when a bunch of [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2578.2s)]
*  protesters stormed the presidential palace and they were just swimming in the swimming pool, [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2584.68s)]
*  having a blast, doing backflips. Yes. Those were simpler days, simpler pronunciations. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2588.68s)]
*  However, it was a serious story. It was a response to a devastating economic crisis, [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2594.36s)]
*  but these guys, they took it into their own hands. At the time, the president fled the [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2597.88s)]
*  countries, resigned, installed somebody who was the last incumbent and was just wildly unpopular [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2601.8s)]
*  because of a bunch of steps they had to take to deal with the IMF, giving them a huge bailout. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2608.36s)]
*  Anyway, Ben, what do you think? I think you did a great job with those names. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2613.8s)]
*  I know nothing about Sri Lankan politics, and I'm doing my best. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2620.68s)]
*  Look, what we know is, first of all, you had an extended period of time that was dominated by [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2623.72s)]
*  the Civil War there, and ultimately the crushing of the Tamil insurgency. And then you had this [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2630.9199999999996s)]
*  kind of autocratic turn after that. Essentially an effort to set up a bit of a single party state. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2637.0s)]
*  Then you had this swing to democracy. Then you had this chaos. What I take away as a casual [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2646.92s)]
*  observer of Sri Lankan politics is it's interesting to see this move to the populist left. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2653.96s)]
*  And actually there's something healthy about that. It's less about just the internal [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2661.88s)]
*  dynamic and strongman politics. This is about anti-corruption, about inequality, [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2667.32s)]
*  about feeling like you've been getting screwed over by corrupt politicians and [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2673.72s)]
*  international financial institutions. What's interesting to me about this is, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2678.6s)]
*  if you look in the region, in Bangladesh we've talked about similar anger at political elites [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2683.48s)]
*  that were out of touch and they were not responsive and were running patronage schemes. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2690.52s)]
*  We've talked a lot about this swing to the right, at the nationalist right, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2697.48s)]
*  as a defining trend of this time. You're seeing in different places this movement to more populist [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2702.2799999999997s)]
*  anti-corruption left. Which from my vantage point- Far left too. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2709.56s)]
*  Yeah. In Germany and France. Sometimes they go real far to the left. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2712.52s)]
*  That to me bears some watching, just because we've seen that now in a number of places, [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2718.52s)]
*  including in South Asia and both Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. But yeah, hope it works out for [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2723.64s)]
*  our friends over there. That's why they pay them the big bucks, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2729.7200000000003s)]
*  folks. That was a good analysis. All right, let's turn back to Brazil then. A couple of weeks ago, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2732.0400000000004s)]
*  we talked about Twitter, now X, but I refuse to call it that, getting shut down in Brazil [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2735.96s)]
*  after Elon Musk refused to comply with a Supreme Court judge's order to shut down a bunch of [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2740.36s)]
*  accounts spreading misinformation, or in some cases, I think that this judge didn't like. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2745.0800000000004s)]
*  The fight got messy. They dragged Elon's satellite internet company, Starling, [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2750.6000000000004s)]
*  into the mix and were starting to penalize them. Elon made a big show of how he was fighting this [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2755.16s)]
*  and he was a free speech warrior and a hero and this and that. But in the end, he caved, [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2760.7599999999998s)]
*  as we would expect. Twitter has now complied with Brazilian authorities by blocking the accounts [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2766.2s)]
*  that they were asked to block, paying some fines. They had to name an official representative for [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2771.72s)]
*  Twitter in Brazil. Twitter addicts in Brazil can't get their fix quite yet. There was a court order [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2776.68s)]
*  issued Saturday that says Twitter has five days to provide even more legal documents to the court. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2783.32s)]
*  I think clearly, Elon wants to get people back on there because I think Blue Sky and Tumblr both [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2788.44s)]
*  have reported massive growth after Twitter went dark in Brazil. But Ben, big picture. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2793.0s)]
*  This conversation is so annoying because obviously free speech is very important and I have a ton of [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2799.32s)]
*  respect for people that fight for it, especially in countries where there's risk to your body or [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2803.56s)]
*  legally or whatever. There's also, I think, a pretty compelling argument that this judge [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2808.52s)]
*  in Brazil was a little out of control and just demanding accounts that were mean to him get [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2813.88s)]
*  blocked even by lawmakers and things. But I just think Elon is so full of shit on this that it's [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2820.44s)]
*  hard to take it seriously because we know in places where he has business interests, [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2825.24s)]
*  he's happy to comply with the law. He says so publicly. He did it. China, India. Yeah. He's [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2829.64s)]
*  like, he flew to China and had a love fest with Xi Jinping. He's got factories there. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2835.0s)]
*  Not a lot of free speech there. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2841.0s)]
*  Second largest shareholder at Twitter is a Saudi prince. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2842.6s)]
*  It's just deeply annoying. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2848.6s)]
*  First of all, just a side comment. What was that? Do you remember when Elon bought Twitter [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2849.64s)]
*  and all the resistance liberals started going to some new platform? It was PreThreads. What was [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2854.6s)]
*  that called? [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2858.76s)]
*  Blue Sky? [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2859.56s)]
*  No, something else. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2860.36s)]
*  Spoutable? [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2861.24s)]
*  It was just, anyway, because there's one of your people doing that in Brazil. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2861.8s)]
*  Macedon? [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2865.2400000000002s)]
*  Macedon. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2865.88s)]
*  Macedon. Is that where you did Toots? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2866.36s)]
*  Yeah. Remember? [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2867.88s)]
*  Buh-bye. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2869.0s)]
*  You go like, yeah. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2869.7200000000003s)]
*  I didn't do any of that shit. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2870.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't do any of that. I don't know. Side note, but it was the greatest hits of [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2871.48s)]
*  resistance Twitter migrating to other platforms. So I don't know if they've done that in Brazil. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2877.7200000000003s)]
*  What I will say is this, Tommy. One of the things I think we forget because we build this picture of [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2882.1200000000003s)]
*  all-powerful tech companies, governments have more power than they think they do sometimes with [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2889.24s)]
*  these tech companies. Look at what's happening now. The Telegram guy is sitting in the fucking [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2895.64s)]
*  Housgou in France. Brazil just squeezed Elon and he needs that market for a bunch of things, [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2902.68s)]
*  and so he caved. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2910.52s)]
*  The EU passed some laws. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2911.24s)]
*  I think we keep learning. Lena Kahn has been like a real thorn in the side of tech companies [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2912.2s)]
*  since she started bringing antitrust measures here in the US. Governments have the capacity [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2919.3999999999996s)]
*  to influence the behavior of these companies, to regulate these companies, to set guardrails [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2925.72s)]
*  around these companies. I'm not saying I agree with everything the judge did, but it's a helpful [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2929.96s)]
*  reminder that this isn't some force of nature beyond our control, which is how the tech companies [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2934.7599999999998s)]
*  are kind of presented oftentimes, particularly social media platforms. There is a space for [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2940.92s)]
*  government to begin to claw back some capacity to regulate these platforms, hopefully for the [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2945.96s)]
*  public good and not just for some political interest. I think we're seeing that correction [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2953.16s)]
*  beginning to happen. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2957.88s)]
*  Even the threat of regulation can get action. Instagram, I think a week ago, just took a bunch [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2958.76s)]
*  of steps to make teenagers' accounts on the platform much more private, like private by [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2964.52s)]
*  default to make it harder to message them, to give parents more access to information about [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2970.84s)]
*  who your kids are talking to, things they obviously should have done years and years ago, [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2976.36s)]
*  given the very well-known harm that's been caused by tons of creeps, basically either [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2981.08s)]
*  exploiting kids that they met on social media, like Instagram through DM, or all these sex [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2988.04s)]
*  extortion schemes that you're hearing about where basically gangs or criminal organizations [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2993.4s)]
*  encourage kids to send them nude photos and then extort them with them. It's led to suicides, [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=2999.8s)]
*  and just all kinds of manners of harm. So yes, governments absolutely have more power than they [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3005.0s)]
*  at times let on. It's half our Congress who just gets bought off by these interests. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3009.88s)]
*  Well, and yeah, part of that was a bunch of state attorney generals bringing suit against [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3013.7200000000003s)]
*  meta for this issue of teen harm on Instagram. And just one more example, it was years ago, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3017.64s)]
*  but Germany started really going after content moderation on Facebook. Lo and behold, it became [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3024.68s)]
*  the place where they had the most per capita content moderators. Governments can compel action [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3032.2799999999997s)]
*  here. They just have to actually act. Yep, absolutely. A couple more quick things. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3037.16s)]
*  Just one weird story, Ben. So listeners might remember this story from last month where there [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3043.0s)]
*  was this luxury yacht off the coast of Sicily. It sank in a freak storm. It was like a water [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3047.96s)]
*  spout, I think. Seven people died, including a British CEO named Mike Lynch. Italian prosecutors [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3054.04s)]
*  were already investigating whether criminal negligence led to the high death toll. But [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3059.08s)]
*  according to CNN, what is also complicating this investigation is suspicion that the yacht might [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3063.16s)]
*  also contain some sort of waterproof safe that includes hard drives that have on them [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3068.28s)]
*  highly sensitive data connected with Western intelligence services, including classified [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3073.8s)]
*  information, passwords and other sensitive data. So in this past, this guy, Mike Lynch, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3078.52s)]
*  he had a cybersecurity company and he worked with the Brits, with US intelligence and other [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3083.4s)]
*  sort of Western companies. And on top of that, apparently his business partner, this guy named [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3088.76s)]
*  Stephen Chamberlain died the same day the boat sank after getting hit by a car a couple of days [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3094.44s)]
*  earlier. I guess there's no evidence that the two events were connected, but like- [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3099.56s)]
*  Other than every spy movie I've ever seen. I was going to say, I've never heard a thing [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3103.7200000000003s)]
*  that's going to breed more conspiracy theories in my life than this story. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3107.08s)]
*  Yeah, or breed like a bunch of, you know, FX shows. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3110.68s)]
*  Really good limited series. Yeah, really good limited series. Yeah, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3114.6s)]
*  yeah. No, I mean, like- That's the half glass full version of it. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3116.76s)]
*  Yeah, no, this stage, you're right. It bears watching because there'd be both conspiracy [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3119.7200000000003s)]
*  theories, but also potential real world ramifications, but it does seem like a good plot for a limited series. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3123.4s)]
*  And then I know you really want to talk about religious tolerance in Albania. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3130.28s)]
*  I'm just saying we may be heading towards the world's newest state. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3134.12s)]
*  And smallest, right? Yes. Albania has this proposal to create [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3138.92s)]
*  a micro state within its capital of Tirana for a Sufi Muslim sect that is focused on [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3142.92s)]
*  tolerance and all good things. I like everything I've read about this. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3150.84s)]
*  I mean, if you're looking for potential locales, Tommy, [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3154.68s)]
*  to move to in the event of a Trump victory, we could be broadcasting from [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3158.92s)]
*  inside the micro state carved out of Tirana. What do you think the, what's the goal here? Who pitched [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3163.2400000000002s)]
*  this? So this seems to be the brainchild of the [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3168.12s)]
*  prime minister of Albania, long time leader of Albania, Edi Rama, who is among other things, [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3170.04s)]
*  also like a well-known artist. So he's kind of a conceptual artist, you know, so. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3175.88s)]
*  Like a sculptor? Yeah, you know, various forms. I mean, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3181.0s)]
*  I'm not, I'm not saying I'm a collector. I'm just saying I'm familiar with his, his vibe. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3183.8s)]
*  And, and, and, and, you know, there's this history of this sect led by a guy named Baba Mundi. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3191.88s)]
*  Great name. I hope I got that right. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3199.4s)]
*  Um, and I think, you know, the idea was that the Albanian state had kind of taken their lands over [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3201.2400000000002s)]
*  the years and, and worst times. Now things are good. Um, and we also believe this, this [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3208.0400000000004s)]
*  micro state kind of a mini Vatican could be an exemplar for the brand of tolerance and, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3215.4s)]
*  you know, religious, you know, acceptance. The message of, uh, Bobby Mundi could resonate [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3222.36s)]
*  from there. Interesting. I mean, it's just, you know, there's, there's stuff happening out there. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3230.28s)]
*  Nothing but tolerance comes out of the Vatican. Yeah. One more country. Yeah. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3235.5600000000004s)]
*  We get one more state out there. Listen, I'd love to go to an even smaller state. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3239.48s)]
*  You've been to Vatican city? I have. It's very cool. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3243.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah. It's very cool. We do an Obama trip there. I might've been after. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3246.36s)]
*  We did an Obama trip there. Uh, and then the Obama trip was very weird. What year was that? [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3248.92s)]
*  That was 2014. Yeah, I was gone. And, uh, so when you wait to see, [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3253.96s)]
*  have the audience of the Pope, every single person in the party is assigned a gentleman, [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3259.72s)]
*  a Vatican gentleman. I'm just going to so many jokes. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3266.36s)]
*  And I'm not saying. Yes. And these are people that are [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3269.56s)]
*  kind of elites in kind of Catholic Roman society. Uh, my gentleman was a lawyer. Um, and they just [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3273.08s)]
*  stand next to you and make small talk the entire time you're waiting there. Like that's kind of [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3280.12s)]
*  their role. They're all dressed up. Do they research on you? Is there like a file? [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3283.7999999999997s)]
*  No, they're super chill Italian guys. You just kind of talk to, yeah. What are your interests? [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3286.68s)]
*  So that was very strange, but, but interesting. And then I went back there, you know, when we [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3290.44s)]
*  completed the Cuba normalization. Oh yeah. Um, and it's weird. Yeah. You go through these walls [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3295.16s)]
*  and suddenly you're like in a different sovereign territory. It's cool. One funny thing about being [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3301.16s)]
*  the Pope is I think everyone who visits you brings you something. And there's all these hilarious [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3305.08s)]
*  videos. I'm just getting handed like the most priceless thing from some foreign leader person. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3309.08s)]
*  He's like, yeah, thanks. Yeah. Yeah. Well, the, they've also been accepting gifts there for, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3313.4s)]
*  you know, almost a couple of thousand years. Yeah. They must have quite a store room. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3318.68s)]
*  You know, the state department has that like protocol gift store room. I mean, they must have [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3321.64s)]
*  a good, I think a lot of things weren't missing there during the Trump years. Yeah. Yeah. Mar-a-Lago. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3325.24s)]
*  $50,000 whiskey or something. Yeah. Yeah. Saudi jewels and stuff. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3329.7999999999997s)]
*  Huh? Funny. Uh, last story, Ben, um, I just, I regret to inform you that Chinese zoos are once [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3333.88s)]
*  again painting the animals. Um, we've covered this in the past. I know. So a second zoo in China was [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3341.2400000000002s)]
*  busted for painting or dying dogs, D Y I N G to look like pandas. Uh, they gave them like the cute [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3347.88s)]
*  little black eyes, the black ears, the white little midsection. Um, and, but this not, if you look at [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3355.08s)]
*  the video, there's someone put on Tik Tok. It's not even remotely believable, but it unraveled [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3361.08s)]
*  because there's one clip where there's this one panda with a little pause for, and he's panting [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3365.64s)]
*  like a dog. And then another cute little dog, like kind of trots into the frame, wagging its fluffy [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3370.52s)]
*  little tail. And it's just so clearly not a panda. It's a chow chow that somebody just adorably painted. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3375.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean, first thought is like, uh, yeah, imagine you're a kid and you're going and, you know, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3383.3199999999997s)]

*  is it time to start questioning whether this is a, like all this discussion of America being in [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3394.12s)]
*  decline? I don't know, man, over there, they're painting painted pandas in the zoos. Like, I don't [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3398.7599999999998s)]
*  know what's going on in China. Xi Jinping, maybe like this should factor into like the instability [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3402.7599999999998s)]
*  index in China. The degree of painted pandas. Also, I did some extensive, uh, research on this, [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3408.04s)]
*  which by that, I mean, I searched once on Twitter and I found a video of a real giant panda from [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3415.16s)]
*  this week named Ding Ding attacking this zookeeper at a different zoo and like going hard at this [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3420.6s)]

*  in politics, including some great anecdotes and insights from people like Ben Rhodes. I'm right [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3595.08s)]
*  in there sitting right across from me. Every book is also making a difference because crooked media [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3599.7999999999997s)]
*  is donating its profits from democracy or else to support vote, save America in 2024 campaigns. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3603.3199999999997s)]
*  It's a really fun book. You'll enjoy it. Go to cricket.com slash books or your local bookstore [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3608.52s)]
*  to get your copy of democracy or else now. All right, we're going to take a quick break. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3612.7599999999998s)]
*  And when we come back, you're going to hear Ben talk with Kim goddess about all the things happening [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3616.44s)]
*  on the ground in Lebanon. Uh, given these Israeli airstrikes into Beirut recently and the growing [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3620.84s)]
*  concern about a big time regional war. So stick around for that. Joining me now from Beirut is [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3627.16s)]
*  Kim goddess, a Lebanese journalist who contributes to the Atlantic and financial times and is also [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3632.28s)]
*  in New York times, bestselling author Kim. Thanks so much for joining us. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3637.48s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Ben. So I mean, just to begin, um, [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3640.84s)]
*  tell us a little bit about what it's like now in Beirut. Uh, what, what's the mood there? [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3643.56s)]
*  It's been a rather tense week after what's been, uh, you know, not to repeat myself, [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3648.6s)]
*  tense 10 months or 11 months by now since the start of the war in Gaza after the, [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3655.32s)]
*  uh, the terrifying attack that Hamas conducted on the 7th of October on the 8th of October, [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3661.64s)]
*  Hezbollah, the Iran backed Shia militant group in Lebanon started launching missiles at [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3667.88s)]
*  Northern Israel. And by doing that, it tied Lebanon's fate to, to Gaza. And it has since [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3672.36s)]
*  been demanding a ceasefire in Gaza in order to stop launching rockets at Northern Israel. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3678.76s)]
*  We've had 11 months of a war of attrition, a slow simmer between the Israelis and Hezbollah. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3683.96s)]
*  But last week things shifted, um, uh, shifted gears quite dramatically. Uh, the pager attacks, [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3690.52s)]
*  were really traumatizing for the Lebanese. You didn't have to be Hezbollah operative. You didn't [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3698.68s)]
*  have to be carrying one of these pagers to be terrorized by what happened last week, [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3702.7599999999998s)]
*  because the uncertainty of it, the sheer terror of these things, we didn't know at first what it was [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3707.08s)]
*  exploding all over the country, uh, in Beirut, um, in the Southern suburbs, in the South, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3712.84s)]
*  sirens wailing for hours, hospitals completely overwhelmed, uh, still operating on some of these, [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3719.7200000000003s)]
*  um, casualties, then followed by walkie talkies exploding the next day, followed by a major [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3726.44s)]
*  strike by the Israelis in the Southern suburbs of Beirut, which killed Hezbollah commander. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3732.44s)]
*  And since Monday, a devastating, uh, air campaign by, by the Israelis. They, they say that it's [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3737.56s)]
*  targeted, but 500 people have already died. And that's a lot in one day. That's, you know, uh, [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3745.16s)]
*  almost half of how many people died during the last war between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3752.04s)]
*  So the Lebanese are living on edge because they don't know what's next. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3758.28s)]
*  We are in uncharted territory. They don't know what's next. And they've been watching Gaza [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3762.6s)]
*  for 11 months now, wondering whether that's their fate now. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3768.04s)]
*  I mean, that makes complete sense. Uh, are people taking precautions now and the expectation that [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3771.96s)]
*  this will continue escalating? Are there, are there any things that can be done to kind of prepare [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3777.56s)]
*  putting Hezbollah aside just among the people to prepare for what may be coming? [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3782.52s)]
*  So some people have decided they can't take it and have left, uh, the country. Not that many, [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3786.6s)]
*  actually. Some people are coming back. Um, I have a friend who runs a business. She has 50 employees [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3793.64s)]
*  here. Her husband and, um, children actually live in Europe and she commutes back and forth. And she [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3800.52s)]
*  came back because she needs to be there for her team. Um, it's very personal. These decisions are, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3805.7999999999997s)]
*  are very personal. Some people left Beirut because they're worried about a massive air [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3812.2s)]
*  campaign against Beirut as happened in 2006 and of course, 1982, the Israeli invasion. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3816.04s)]
*  And people in southern Lebanon, we've had several waves of exodus from the south because [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3822.2799999999997s)]
*  the headlines are mostly about Israelis who've had to leave northern Israel, but 80,000 [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3828.44s)]
*  Lebanese have had to leave southern Lebanon over the last 11 months. And now since Monday, [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3835.88s)]
*  thousands and thousands of them have been flooding out of the, out of the south into [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3842.2000000000003s)]
*  other parts of Lebanon, looking for safety, looking for shelter, being welcomed in schools, [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3849.1600000000003s)]
*  people's homes. How else do you prepare? I don't really know Ben, you know, I grew up in Lebanon [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3854.2000000000003s)]
*  during the civil war. I remember a little bit, the Israeli invasion of 1982. I was very, very young, [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3860.04s)]
*  but we had to leave Beirut as well. I remember hunkering in the back of my mother's car with [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3867.32s)]
*  one of my sisters driving in the, in the, in the dark of night out of the city. Um, I lived through [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3871.6400000000003s)]
*  2006 as a reporter, I covered that war and you try to rationalize, you stock up on a few things, [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3877.7200000000003s)]
*  water, cash, make sure your passport is, is handy. But you also try to carry on your, [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3886.2000000000003s)]
*  your normal life as much as you can until it's on your doorstep. And I was discussing that with a [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3892.2s)]
*  friend this evening. Are we being, are we in denial? Should, should we leave the city? Because [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3898.3599999999997s)]
*  we simply don't know what's going to happen. And by the time it's at your doorstep, it's too late. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3905.16s)]
*  And that's, that's how you sink into war and suddenly you can become a refugee. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3909.8799999999997s)]
*  Yes. Well, that's, that's quite harrowing. I mean, how are people getting information? [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3913.8799999999997s)]
*  We've seen these reports of the IDF texting people, Netanyahu's given a message to try to [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3917.64s)]
*  reach Lebanese. How is the Lebanese government communicating? And do people, what do people [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3922.6s)]
*  make of the information that is coming their way? So like everybody, people are very connected here, [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3927.96s)]
*  social media, Twitter, Instagram, very good reporters, very good media, very good newspapers, [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3932.2799999999997s)]
*  there's partisan sometimes, but, but generally good, accurate, fast information. We don't have [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3940.28s)]
*  a president, we don't have a cabinet, we have a caretaker cabinet. They're doing the best they [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3948.6000000000004s)]
*  can, but they're also blamed for leading us into this situation. The minister of health has done [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3953.88s)]
*  an incredible job over the last week because their responsibility and all the hospitals, [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3961.4s)]
*  their first priority is treating the injured and that has to remain possible for hospitals [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3967.88s)]
*  in Lebanon. When the injured come to your door and the wounded, you treat them. You don't actually [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3974.84s)]
*  ask too many questions because that's just the duty of care of a hospital. And now he's having [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3980.28s)]
*  to deal with a wave of refugee and 500 killed in one day. He's been a caretaker minister for [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3986.2000000000003s)]
*  a few years now. There's no end in sight for this political crisis. And as you mentioned, yes, [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=3995.88s)]
*  there are these messages coming from Israel, automated phone calls, which freaked out a lot [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4003.1600000000003s)]
*  of people. The mother of a friend of mine received one. Another friend in his office building received [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4007.56s)]
*  one. They have nothing to do with the government. They have nothing to do with Hezbollah. It's just [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4014.52s)]
*  an office building. And they received one of those phone calls to evacuate immediately. And so they [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4017.88s)]
*  did. They left. And that is really psychological warfare. And that's why this city is very much [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4023.16s)]
*  on edge. And then you have the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, saying, [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4031.24s)]
*  our war is not with you, it's with Hezbollah. I think the Lebanese are going to have a hard [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4035.24s)]
*  time believing that. Many of them oppose Hezbollah. There are a lot of opponents of Hezbollah in the [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4039.72s)]
*  political realm of life and civilian amongst just general people. Hezbollah doesn't have a lot of [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4046.04s)]
*  political support. But the Lebanese are not going to believe the Israeli prime minister when he [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4054.52s)]
*  says we're coming after Hezbollah, not Lebanon. And one thing, just so our listeners understand, [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4059.56s)]
*  Hezbollah has this kind of reputation in the US and the West as a terrorist organization opposed to [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4065.0s)]
*  Israel. But it's also deeply embedded in the Lebanese state. It's embedded in Lebanese society, [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4071.16s)]
*  Lebanese ministries. Talk a little bit about how Hezbollah fits into the complex puzzle that is [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4077.7999999999997s)]
*  Lebanon. It's a political party with ministers in the government, with members of parliament. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4083.0s)]
*  It's a militant group armed to the teeth, backed by Iran. And so it has now dual, very much dual [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4089.3199999999997s)]
*  allegiance, if you will. It benefits from the system in Lebanon. It operates within that system. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4099.56s)]
*  But I want to choose my words very carefully. It is not the system because I know how these [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4106.6s)]
*  quotes that then get picked up by somebody somewhere and say, oh, well, all of Lebanon is [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4112.04s)]
*  Hezbollah. And before we know it, every hospital is Hezbollah as well. It is not ingrained in [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4117.16s)]
*  the system. It is embedded in all of society. It is a strong political militant player in Lebanon, [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4128.6s)]
*  which has a support base within the Shia community. Some of it is absolute ideological, [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4136.52s)]
*  willing support. And some of it, I have no doubt, is also coerced. And they're armed to the teeth. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4144.280000000001s)]
*  So it's also very hard to really stand up to them. And people have, and they got shot, [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4151.72s)]
*  they got blown up. The Lebanese Prime Minister, Rafiq Hariri, in 2005, Hezbollah stands accused [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4158.04s)]
*  of killing him. And there's a litany of names as well. And also, Hezbollah is a regional [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4163.56s)]
*  paramilitary player. They were deeply involved on the side of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4170.5199999999995s)]
*  supporting his regime, making it possible for him to survive. And that means that they also have a [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4177.48s)]
*  lot of Syrian blood on their hands, something that most people in the West don't quite realize. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4182.84s)]
*  But they were essential. And so they are an element of the microcosm of Lebanese society, [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4189.400000000001s)]
*  but they certainly don't represent all of it. I'm not going to get into percentages, but [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4199.64s)]
*  you know, I would say a minority. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4208.92s)]
*  Yeah, no, that makes sense. Well, with respect to Hezbollah, is there any sense of how [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4211.4s)]
*  much the pager attacks and the various strikes have thrown them off balance, degraded their [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4217.72s)]
*  leadership? And how do you balance their kind of imperative to respond to what Israel's doing [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4223.48s)]
*  versus whatever losses they may need to process here? [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4229.4s)]
*  So I would say that these are some of the heaviest, most dramatic losses that have been [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4232.92s)]
*  inflicted on Hezbollah in a very long time, if ever, since their creation in the 80s. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4238.6s)]
*  It looks to me like the whole top tier and second tier of leadership has been decapitated, save a [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4245.24s)]
*  few. The pager attacks, and that has been done over the last 10 months, you know, this sort of [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4253.96s)]
*  constant assassinations by Israel of these commanders in the field, and now more high ranking [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4261.16s)]
*  assassinations with these more recent strikes. And then the pager attacks, you know, I can imagine [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4270.5199999999995s)]
*  that any organization that suddenly loses its means to communicate, even temporarily, will face [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4277.32s)]
*  some chaos and some difficulty regrouping. So I think there's no doubt that they're on the back [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4283.56s)]
*  foot, that their strategy isn't working. Their strategy lies in tatters. They thought that they [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4291.4800000000005s)]
*  could just, you know, maintain this war of attrition and uphold the flag of Palestine [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4298.76s)]
*  without endangering Lebanon, because they actually don't want an all out war with Israel. Neither [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4304.360000000001s)]
*  does their patron, Iran. But I think they're finding out that their strategy, that they [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4310.44s)]
*  miscalculated, that they misread Israel, that Israel was actually willing to escalate to try to [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4316.759999999999s)]
*  take them out at whatever cost, and we'll see what cost that will be for the Lebanese. I would say [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4323.32s)]
*  that they're currently in chaos, that they have been decapitated at the leadership level, [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4331.24s)]
*  that that can be dangerous because you decapitate the leadership. And then the man at the top, [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4340.04s)]
*  Hassan Nasrallah, might have some trouble organizing the younger level, more inexperienced [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4344.76s)]
*  guys who might not follow orders, want revenge for the losses that they've sustained, their [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4350.5199999999995s)]
*  colleagues, etc. We have to remember they are, to some extent, whether we like them or not, rational [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4357.72s)]
*  actors. So you have to understand their analysis. They're going to want revenge as well. How exactly [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4363.4s)]
*  they do it, and whether they still have the capacity today, or whether they need to regroup. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4370.36s)]
*  I do think that they will try to still strike some destructive blows on Israel. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4375.56s)]
*  I mean, looking at Israel, you've obviously been an analyst of this for many years. Part of what [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4382.92s)]
*  is so worrying to me is that even if it has blows on the back foot, they're not going to be eliminated. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4387.8s)]
*  And so Israel appears to be escalating and achieving a bunch of tactical goals, [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4394.6s)]
*  but to what end? I mean, it's not unlike Gaza in a way in the sense that it's hard to see what [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4399.400000000001s)]
*  the end game is. I mean, what do you make of Israel's intentions here in taking these steps [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4404.4400000000005s)]
*  now? And where do you think they might be going? Very hard to say, Ben. Because [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4409.64s)]
*  they are saying that they want to escalate so that they can de-escalate. They want to [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4417.08s)]
*  escalate so that Hezbollah raises the white flag. Hezbollah is not going to admit defeat. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4423.64s)]
*  I mean, Hamas hasn't admitted defeat 11 months into this war, right? And so again, we have to [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4430.6s)]
*  understand the rationale of these actors. Hezbollah has lost a lot of its aura of invincibility. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4437.72s)]
*  Its base is afraid. I mean, Hezbollah can't protect them. They're refugees now. They are being [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4445.160000000001s)]
*  blown up. Their pager is exploding everywhere. And it looks like there isn't much help coming. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4452.84s)]
*  It doesn't sound to me at the moment like the cavalry is coming because today in New York, [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4461.72s)]
*  the Iranian president and foreign minister indicated that they were ready to negotiate [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4468.360000000001s)]
*  with the United States about the nuclear file. So that's the context in which Hezbollah operates. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4473.96s)]
*  And in addition, we heard the Iranian president say that Hezbollah cannot take on Israel on its [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4480.84s)]
*  own. But he didn't say, we're coming to its rescue. Iran wants to preserve its regime at all cost. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4487.32s)]
*  And so I think Hezbollah is finding itself a little bit isolated. Now, I've learned one thing, [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4495.4s)]
*  which is never to write about the demise of Hezbollah or Iran until, you know, it can be verified. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4500.679999999999s)]
*  So we'll have to see, you know, how that evolves. But when it comes to Israel, [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4507.56s)]
*  you know, we've been waking up in Beirut for 11 months now with one minister or another, [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4514.76s)]
*  one settler leader or another calling for the annihilation of Beirut, of Lebanon, calling us all [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4520.76s)]
*  Hezbollah, you know, talking about annexation of southern Lebanon. Just now, you know, random [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4528.76s)]
*  people, but that add to the echo chamber, tweeting about, you know, once we, you know, [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4534.28s)]
*  expel all the Shias from southern Lebanon, the Christians can decide whether they want to be part [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4540.2s)]
*  of Israel or not. And otherwise they can leave too. You know, that kind of language, [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4544.679999999999s)]
*  it's an understatement, what I'm going to say, is not conducive to long term peace [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4552.2s)]
*  in this region. So to wake up every day with people calling for your annihilation, [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4556.44s)]
*  which the Israelis themselves complained about, right? I mean, they complain that they get [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4562.12s)]
*  to hear that Iran wants to erase Israel. But they say the same. And so what exactly are Israel's [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4566.68s)]
*  intention? If they think that they can escalate to de-escalate, I can tell you now that that's not [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4573.0s)]
*  going to work. I've written a piece in the Financial Times, which will be out today in the [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4578.2s)]
*  paper saying that we have a short window of opportunity for diplomacy to achieve quick [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4583.48s)]
*  results and try to contain this very quickly while everybody's in New York. And that is to [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4590.28s)]
*  offer a face saving way out for Hezbollah. Because Israel may want to humiliate Hezbollah, [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4596.44s)]
*  even America would like to humiliate Hezbollah for the Marines bombing attack in the 80s. You know, [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4601.719999999999s)]
*  Hezbollah is not on everybody's, on many people's, you know, favorite list. So you may want to [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4607.5599999999995s)]
*  humiliate them, but you need to give them an off ramp. I don't know that they'll take it. And so [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4613.16s)]
*  you need to give them an off ramp whereby they can say, yes, we have supported Palestine for [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4617.56s)]
*  Gaza for 11 months. But we understand that now Lebanon is at stake. And for the sake of Lebanon, [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4623.64s)]
*  we're going to stand down. What that requires then, Ben, is America getting ironclad guarantees from [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4629.400000000001s)]
*  the Israelis that they will also stand down. And the Biden administration does not have a great [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4635.96s)]
*  track record over the last 11 months getting Israel to do what it's being asked by the Biden [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4641.4800000000005s)]
*  administration. Yeah, or being able to guarantee that it can deliver Israel and that kind of [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4645.56s)]
*  negotiation. Well, one last question. I mean, you mentioned the Civil War, you mentioned the 2006 [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4650.6s)]
*  war, you've had the collapsed economy there, you've had, you know, government dysfunction, [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4656.76s)]
*  you had the explosion in Beirut and the port a few years ago. How does this moment fit into that [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4662.6s)]
*  context? I mean, is this just a resilient people that are dealing with yet another crisis? Or does [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4670.84s)]
*  this feel somehow different? Can I swear on the podcast? Yes, we swear all the time. Okay. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4676.6s)]
*  I just thought I'd check. So we're not very fond of the word resilience in this country anymore, [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4683.96s)]
*  because people are exhausted. Without revealing my age, it has been it has, you know, war and [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4689.88s)]
*  conflict have dominated my whole life. I still cry when I watch some of the coverage of the 2006 [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4696.68s)]
*  war that I when I was with the with the BBC. But there is something about this country, [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4707.240000000001s)]
*  it really should be an utter chaos and complete sort of, you know, disarray with gangs roaming [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4711.72s)]
*  the streets and people locked up at night behind, you know, metal bars for fear of, [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4717.8s)]
*  you know, robberies, etc. But civil order has somehow remained a constant in this country. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4724.2s)]
*  I feel safer walking on the streets of Beirut, except for Israeli shelling now, [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4731.96s)]
*  but safer walking on the streets of Beirut than I would on the streets of New York at night. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4735.96s)]
*  The sense of community remains strong despite everything. And that's how this country [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4741.4s)]
*  somehow continues to function. And I have a friend who has visited has covered rather as a [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4747.0s)]
*  journalist all sorts of war torn countries, you know, Somalia, Bosnia, Sarajevo, you name it, [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4753.48s)]
*  she's she's covered it. And she came to Lebanon for the first time in 2015, after a wave of [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4762.12s)]
*  bomb attacks and assassinations. And she was just surprised. She said, wow, this is the most [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4769.08s)]
*  normal fucked up country I've ever been to. And I think that really sums it up. We're always [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4777.0s)]
*  looking for the next solution, the next way to adapt. And as I said at the beginning of our [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4783.88s)]
*  conversation, you know, we we keep things going for as long as we can. The downside of that, [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4790.04s)]
*  I have found is that we don't necessarily fix things we paper over, we put band aids, [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4797.0s)]
*  and as long as we can still be with our family, be with our friends, go to Sunday lunch, go to [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4803.56s)]
*  the mountains at the weekend, enjoy the sunshine, we're willing to, you know, let go of all the [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4808.6s)]
*  things that aren't that aren't working. But people are also exhausted. You know, the port explosion [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4816.76s)]
*  was was incredibly traumatic. It's imprinted in all our DNA. And now we're going through war [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4822.28s)]
*  again. And of course, you know, we went we went through through COVID. But I always say Lebanon [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4830.759999999999s)]
*  is is always a playground, never a player. And so a lot of regional conflicts are settled here, [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4836.679999999999s)]
*  a lot of what is wrong in the region explodes here. And a lot of what gets resolved first gets [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4844.04s)]
*  resolved here. I often quote Amos Oz, an Israeli journalist and author and peace activist, [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4851.56s)]
*  who was very much opposed to Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982. And he said at the time, [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4861.8s)]
*  you know, we can never atone for what we did in in Beirut. And I think that we're still living [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4870.52s)]
*  with the consequences of what was unleashed in 1982, and how that changed Lebanon, Israel, Iran, [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4875.88s)]
*  and the US. No, well, it's a good reminder that these decisions, they have generational implications. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4883.08s)]
*  So let's hope for the sake of the people of Lebanon that things don't get any worse. But [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4890.36s)]
*  I really do appreciate you coming on to share the perspective and everybody should check out [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4896.36s)]
*  your article in the Financial Times and continue to follow your work. So thanks so much, Kim. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4901.08s)]
*  Thanks so much, Ben. Thank you. Thanks again to Kim Katas for joining the show. And that's it for [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4905.56s)]
*  us this week. That's it. Have fun at Ungo Ben. Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it. I actually [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flhuxVIcT_4&t=4910.360000000001s)]
