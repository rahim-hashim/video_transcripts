# Indicted US Senator Called to Resign for Accepting Bribes to Benefit Egypt
**Pod Save the World:** [September 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30)
*  Welcome back to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Ben Rhodes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=0.0s)]
*  Ben, I think we had this exact same conversation a year ago, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3.08s)]
*  but I want to offer a blanket apology to everyone that was forced to watch the Patriots-Jets game on Sunday. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=5.92s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I apologize to anyone who watches Zach Wilson do anything, the Jets quarterback. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=13.32s)]
*  Zach Wilson, your quarterback. My quarterback allegedly slapped your cornerback in the balls. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=17.92s)]
*  He did. There's video of it. I mean, it's not allegedly. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=24.16s)]
*  We can see the evidence like Donald Trump in this. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=26.88s)]
*  Yeah. Also documents not covered in glory. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=28.880000000000003s)]
*  No. That game. I was lucky on a plane. So it was one of those really small TVs. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=31.44s)]
*  It's coming back from a wedding in Wisconsin. Yeah, I just I would crew. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=35.68s)]
*  I'm avoiding the Jets. I can't I don't have the stomach for it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  I think that's right. I think that's right. Well, we got a lot of news today to distract us from [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=42.96s)]
*  terrible sports franchises. We are going to cover the foreign policy implications of the indictment [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=48.08s)]
*  of Senator Bob Menendez, Democrat from New Jersey, the latest from Russia and Ukraine, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=52.56s)]
*  a correction, an important one from the New York Times about Ron DeSantis and his work [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=57.2s)]
*  at Guantanamo Bay Prison, an update on the diplomatic row between Canada and India. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  I love saying row. It feels very British. Yeah. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  We're going to talk about debatably the worst vetting mistake of all time in politics. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=68.48s)]
*  Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, did an interview with Fox News. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=74.08s)]
*  Talk about sanctions and migration. Quick update on Niger, some news about [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=78.0s)]
*  undiplomatic ambassadors. And then Ben, you did today's interview. What are we going to hear about? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=83.52s)]
*  Yes. So I talked to Alicia Barton, who's the International Crisis Group Senior Analyst for [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=88.08s)]
*  the region that includes Armenia and Azerbaijan. So we talked about the situation there where you [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=94.16s)]
*  have essentially the one hundred and fifty thousand ethnic Armenians who've been living in this enclave [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=99.92s)]
*  of Nagorno-Karabakh. They've been starved for months and then essentially militarily defeated [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=104.72s)]
*  and are being driven from their homes as we speak. So there's essentially a mass [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=112.4s)]
*  ethnic cleansing of these people moving into Armenia. And so we talked about how that happened, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=116.88s)]
*  why that happened, what's going to happen next, what the United States and the national community [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  can do to cement the powers there as we speak and really get some important texture from the ground [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=127.28s)]
*  to what it feels like, what life is like for these people that are on this unimaginable exile [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=133.36s)]
*  journey out of their homeland forever. I mean, I think the main takeaway, Tommy, for me is like, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=141.52s)]
*  this is pretty well done and it just happened in like a week. It happened so fast. There was [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=148.16s)]
*  a slow motion buildup and people will say they've been warning about this all year and they have. So [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=155.36s)]
*  I don't want to diminish that, but this end play happened in a week. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=159.2s)]
*  Yeah, no, I mean, look, you and I were just talking before we started recording. We covered [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=163.44s)]
*  this a week or two ago and there was what seemed like a sliver of good news because the only road [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=166.48s)]
*  from Armenia into Nagorno-Karabakh had been opened up by Azerbaijan. People thought maybe to get [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=171.83999999999997s)]
*  aid in, but it turned out the Azerbaijanis just rolled in their troops and used this as a pretext [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=177.76s)]
*  to invade. I mean, there have been on and off wars in Nagorno-Karabakh for decades. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=183.44s)]
*  But it seems like the die was cast in, what is it, 2020 when Azerbaijan took back a lot of [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=189.2s)]
*  territory. Yeah, I think what we learned from that is Azerbaijan is just much, much more stronger [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=194.64s)]
*  militarily than Armenia for a lot of reasons, including a military buildup funded by oil. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=198.95999999999998s)]
*  But also what's happened this time is the Russian peacekeepers went there to break it up. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=206.64s)]
*  So it's also a story about diminishing Russian influence in that part of the world. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=211.28s)]
*  Yeah, let's start with the now former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=214.72s)]
*  Bob Menendez. So last week, Bob Menendez was charged with three counts of using his official [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=219.6s)]
*  office to do favors in exchange for bribes. That include hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=224.72s)]
*  gold bars, a Mercedes. I think there were some mortgage payments for Menendez and his wife. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=230.88s)]
*  There's a couple of different strands of corruption here, so I'll just lay them out quickly. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=236.64s)]
*  Menendez allegedly called a senior official of the Department of Agriculture in an attempt to [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=240.64000000000001s)]
*  protect his friend's monopoly on imported halal meat to Egypt. That's part one. Part two, Menendez [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=245.36s)]
*  is accused of pushing Biden to install a U.S. attorney in New Jersey that he thought he could [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=251.28s)]
*  control and then tried to interfere in the prosecution of an associate in exchange for cash. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=256.48s)]
*  But the biggest piece of this from our perspective is that Menendez took bribes from an intermediary [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=262.0s)]
*  on behalf of the Egyptian government, the military and intel guys, I believe specifically, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=266.96s)]
*  in exchange for helping increase U.S. military assistance to Egypt. Some of the things specifically [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=271.44s)]
*  that Menendez did include passing along detailed information about the staffing of the U.S. embassy [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=278.47999999999996s)]
*  in Cairo, like the number of U.S. or American staffers and local staff. Menendez apparently [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=284.08s)]
*  drafted a letter for the Egyptian government to use to send to his Senate colleagues to try to [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=289.2s)]
*  unblock aid, like to help them figure out the best arguments that all got routed through his [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=295.12s)]
*  girlfriend and wife. And then, you know, for listeners, remember that Egypt is the second [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=299.76s)]
*  largest recipient of U.S. military aid after Israel. And these alleged bribes to Menendez [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=303.36s)]
*  came at a time when aid to Egypt was held up over human rights concerns. Some listeners might be [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=308.4s)]
*  thinking, Ben, like what the hell can a random guy from New Jersey do to influence foreign military [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=314.0s)]
*  sales? Yeah, the answer is a lot. If said guy is or woman is chairman or ranking member of the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=318.8s)]
*  Senate Foreign Relations Committee, those folks can put a hold on foreign military sales. They [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=325.2s)]
*  can lean on the White House to do more. They can generally impact, you know, personnel and policy. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=330.0s)]
*  So, Ben, there's a lot to this one, but let's just sort of like take a beat and talk about what we [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=335.52s)]
*  just discussed. I mean, the allegations are part old school corruption, but like he's also acting [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=340.72s)]
*  as a foreign agent in some sense for the Egyptian government. Like I don't want to use the word [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=348.08s)]
*  treason. That's obviously like that's not what this is. I saw some people saying that on Twitter, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=352.4s)]
*  but it's like he is acting on behalf of a not all that friendly government, providing them [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=355.52s)]
*  nonpublic information. I mean, this is really bad. This is worse than just taking bribes to me. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=363.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And, you know, we'll get to the second part of that, which is Menendez's impact on [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=367.91999999999996s)]
*  foreign policy generally, and Latin America policy particularly, but starting on the Egypt [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=373.84s)]
*  piece of it, this is pretty astonishing stuff because first of all, as you said, this is like [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=378.64s)]
*  not public information that he's providing. It's, you know, sensitive information in a lot of ways, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=385.68s)]
*  right? The staffing of the embassy, for instance. But I think even more egregious is the role he's [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=390.4s)]
*  playing essentially as a lobbyist for the Egyptian government. What you describe is what a lobbyist [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=397.2s)]
*  does. Here's how you write a letter to the senators to make it most likely that you get this funding [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=403.52s)]
*  released. You have to register under FARA to do it, the foreign agent registration. And what is [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=408.0s)]
*  particularly grotesque about this is that Bob Menendez consistently puts himself forward as [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=412.15999999999997s)]
*  this champion of democracy and human rights around the world, you know? And here he is helping a [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=418.4s)]
*  brutal dictatorship in Egypt that has tens of thousands of political prisoners that routinely [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=424.8s)]
*  has its funding scrutinized and held up by Congress because of its violations of human rights. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=429.2s)]
*  And for example, turning the military on protesters and killing hundreds of people. Yeah. And so this [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=436.32s)]
*  guy is simultaneously mouthing words about human rights while literally helping a dictatorship lobby [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=441.92s)]
*  to maintain billions of dollars assistance despite human rights issues. And that is both [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=450.4s)]
*  corrupt and it is also like the most cynical thing I can think about, you know, because [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=456.47999999999996s)]
*  it's what everybody thinks the United States is full of shit. You know, like, oh, we talk about [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=461.52s)]
*  these things, but then we like, you know, scratch the backs of these dictatorships. That's literally [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=465.59999999999997s)]
*  what he's doing. And he's doing it for payment. So it's like everything in one scandal that sucks [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=469.44s)]
*  about American foreign policy. You know, it's corrupted, it's hypocritical, it's cozy with [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=475.2s)]
*  dictators. Like everything is in this one indictment of this guy. And look, this will lead in the second [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=479.84s)]
*  part discussion, like everybody knows and has known for a long time that Bob Menendez is corrupt. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=488.56s)]
*  You know, there's just been this talk. Why was he the chair of the farm relations committee? You [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=493.12s)]
*  know, like that, why was he allowed to have this kind of influence in American foreign policy, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=496.08s)]
*  given that this guy, maybe people didn't know the extent of this Egypt thing, but I mean, he's [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=500.64s)]
*  he was indicted in 2015. He barely beat the rap in 2015. Look, I know, innocent children, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=505.03999999999996s)]
*  but like, it's not exactly a secret in Washington. Bob Menendez plays pretty close to the sun on [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=509.44s)]
*  corruption issues. Yeah. And we should say, you know, Menendez denies these allegations. He says [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=514.56s)]
*  he won't resign. His defense is basically like, look, I was just doing what anyone would do for [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=519.4399999999999s)]
*  their constituents. That's what senators do all day every day. You fight for businesses in your [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=524.0s)]
*  district or whatever. He suggested that this cash that was found is his own money that he took out [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=527.6s)]
*  of the bank and that he would took out huge wads of cash because he was scarred by his family's [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=533.84s)]
*  experience in Cuba, I guess, sort of pre Castro. Wait a second, though. Time out on that one. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=540.64s)]
*  That's what he said. His family never lived in Cuba under Castro. Like, like he's fucking full [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=546.48s)]
*  of shit. It's just like Rubio's story about the M when you know, this guy, General Rubio, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=552.0s)]
*  Menendez, his family left Cuba before the revolution. So when he says like, we have [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=558.72s)]
*  the fear of communism in our family and we need therefore I like having cash out. That's that's [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=562.96s)]
*  not true. He's making up a story like like I'm sorry, like playing that card in this case doesn't [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=568.24s)]
*  make any sense. Well, yeah. He also suggested that he's just being targeted because he's Latino, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=574.0s)]
*  which also I've not seen any evidence of that. Well, so Ben, let's talk about the foreign policy [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=581.84s)]
*  implications that you hinted at. Last week, the Biden administration announced temporary protected [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=585.36s)]
*  status for nearly five hundred thousand Venezuelan migrants currently in the U.S. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=591.36s)]
*  That means the people that entered the U.S. before July 31st, they can apply for work permits. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=595.2s)]
*  Administration officials say that they they extended TPS, I think, for 18 months in this case [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=600.96s)]
*  to these Venezuelans because the situation in Venezuela is deteriorating. I'm sure they're also [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=606.0s)]
*  worried that cities like New York are loudly complaining about the fact that they can't [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=611.28s)]
*  manage the influx of migrants. There's nowhere to house people. They can't feed them. They can't [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=617.76s)]
*  work here. Right. It's all right. You can work like. So this is a no brainer to me. Let people [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=621.76s)]
*  work if they're here. Right. Let them make money or else. How else are they going to live? But, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=626.88s)]
*  you know, as we've discussed on the show many times, you don't hear a lot of debate in Washington [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=630.5600000000001s)]
*  about how to alleviate the root causes of migration in places like Venezuela, including, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=635.0400000000001s)]
*  you know, the causes like U.S. sanctions. Here's a clip from Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=639.76s)]
*  talking about how U.S. sanctions have helped create the migration crisis on the southern border. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=645.44s)]
*  If we are constantly engaging in foreign policy that drives people to our southern border, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=649.44s)]
*  in this specific instance, U.S. sanctions that were originally authored by Marco Rubio [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=655.6800000000001s)]
*  began and precipitated certainly took a large part in the driving of populations to our southern [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=661.2s)]
*  border. Shortly after those sanctions, those broad-based sanctions. You're talking about [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=666.96s)]
*  Venezuela. Yes. Shortly after those broad-based sanctions were enacted, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=670.4000000000001s)]
*  we started seeing dramatic increases in these populations that were coming to our southern [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=674.48s)]
*  border. And so we have to address the root of these population movements and the migration crisis. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=679.76s)]
*  And we also have to address the domestic U.S. policy issues when it comes to immigration reform. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=685.44s)]
*  She mentions Rubio. I mean, you could put Bob Menendez in the same bucket. He's hardline on [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=692.0s)]
*  Venezuela. He's super hawkish on Iran. He's super hawkish on Cuba. He opposed President Obama even [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=697.44s)]
*  visiting Cuba or accepting any sort of olive branch. But again, good for AOC for talking about how [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=705.04s)]
*  sanctions are playing a role in driving the migration crisis. Yeah. No, really good for her [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=712.16s)]
*  to raise the visibility. This is a great issue for her to speak out on. And just so people [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=716.64s)]
*  understand how this works, Bob Menendez is the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=720.32s)]
*  The reason he's had such a hugely outsized role in Latin America policy, mainly hardline policies [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=724.4s)]
*  towards Venezuela and Cuba. So all these sanctions that have punished the people of those countries [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=730.64s)]
*  while doing nothing to bring about positive change, while driving hundreds of thousands of [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=736.16s)]
*  people to our borders and humanitarian crisis, he's able to do that because he's weaponized his [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=740.0s)]
*  chairmanship. And what do I mean by that? It's well known that if you touch Cuba, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=745.12s)]
*  you're never going to get confirmed for any ambassadorship, any Senate confirmed position. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=752.3199999999999s)]
*  Meaning if you have not a hawkish position for dialogue. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=756.88s)]
*  I don't want to name names, but there are people who just because they worked with me on that Cuba [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=761.12s)]
*  opening, even though they were just doing the policy of the administration at the time, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=765.36s)]
*  they have not been able to advance in their careers because Bob Menendez, it's very clear. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=769.28s)]
*  Won't confirm them. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=773.12s)]
*  That he won't confirm them. But even beyond that, I think the Biden administration is internalized. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=773.76s)]
*  Bob Menendez will actually mess with all of our confirmations if we change Cuba policy [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=779.36s)]
*  or Venezuela policy. He was willing to weaponize almost like Tommy Tuberville style. He'll just [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=783.12s)]
*  hold up all your ambassadors if he doesn't like what you do in Cuba. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=788.16s)]
*  And by the way, when he was prosecuted in 2015 and then got off because of the hung jury, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=790.96s)]
*  he literally gave a speech where he was like, to those people who hung with me, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=794.8s)]
*  I'll remember you. And to those who didn't, I'll never forget you. He's like, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=798.16s)]
*  vindictive in public about it. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=801.92s)]
*  He is famous for a grudge. And if I sound like it's personal for me, it is. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=803.4399999999999s)]
*  I think it's also wrong what he does because he, like more than any senator that I encountered, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=808.64s)]
*  certainly any Democrat that I encountered, he would carry these grudges and he would take things [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=813.92s)]
*  out on civil servants and he would, again, weaponize his position. Make your argument, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=817.92s)]
*  but he refuses to allow there to be alternate views. So if you want to know why Latin America [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=823.84s)]
*  policy is so distorted and dumb, it's because it's been made in fear of this guy. And frankly, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=830.56s)]
*  we benefited. He was booted from the chairmanship when we did the Cuba opening because he was under [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=837.76s)]
*  a different prosecution. So we would have done anyway, but it coincidentally was easier for us. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=844.8s)]
*  Coincidentally, by the way, conspiracy theorist, I had no idea what the fucking prosecution of [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=853.04s)]
*  Bob Menendez was. But that's the first point. This hopefully is an opportunity for the Biden [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=857.12s)]
*  people to say, OK, without this guy chairing this committee, now we can have a more rational [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=863.6s)]
*  approach that tries to end Venezuela's humanitarian crisis. Now we can have a different Cuba policy [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=868.5600000000001s)]
*  that stops punishing people and driving them to our borders. That's the opportunity to open up. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=873.6800000000001s)]
*  I will say just because I saw one thing when I came in here, Tommy, on the broader migration issue, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=877.6s)]
*  I saw a non friend of the pod, Suella Braverman, give this speech at AEI. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=883.44s)]
*  From the Boris Johnson fan over in the British government. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=889.68s)]
*  She's like the hard ass anti-immigrant home secretary where she said basically we have to [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=893.36s)]
*  get rid of the UN Convention on Refugees. No, the problem is that we don't have an agreement like [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=898.7199999999999s)]
*  that that work. So the point is that Biden took the right step, but it's ad hoc. Everything around [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=905.68s)]
*  immigration in this country and in Europe are these kind of ad hoc responses to surges. So now [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=910.56s)]
*  the Venezuelans can work, but nobody else can't. It's the right step, but it also kind of points [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=915.2s)]
*  out how broken this entire infrastructure is, our own policies and the international policies here. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=921.0400000000001s)]
*  And what we really need is an effort to fix those. Yeah. And I think so often these discussions [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=926.5600000000001s)]
*  politically get driven by these sort of narrow political considerations in Florida. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=931.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Like we can't we can't get rid of the embargo with Cuba because hardline Cubans will [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=935.44s)]
*  vote Republican. We can't try to take a different approach to Venezuela because the big Venezuelan [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=940.8s)]
*  community in Florida will oppose that. Listen, that's true. But at some point I would like to [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=946.0799999999999s)]
*  manage those politics, take a different approach that might actually address the problem on the [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=952.8s)]
*  border. And if there are hardliners who oppose trying to make life better for Venezuelans, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=958.88s)]
*  so people want to stay in Venezuela, then you accuse them of exacerbating the border crisis. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=964.0799999999999s)]
*  Like we got to go on offense here. I'm much more worried about the politics of immigration [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=968.0799999999999s)]
*  than I am people saying that we need to keep the embargo going on Cuba. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=971.76s)]
*  No, that's such a good point because it's both that kind of dumb DC mindset where [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=976.4s)]
*  at some point everybody decided that you had to be afraid of the right-wing politics in [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=980.9599999999999s)]
*  Florida on this. And that's outdated, first of all, because Florida is not really swing state [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=985.28s)]
*  anymore. But also what that misses is it's the Republican strategy to create this chaos, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=989.4399999999999s)]
*  to underfund asylum judges, to sanction places. They want to create migration crises so that they [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=994.64s)]
*  can then kind of blame government for failing to solve those crises. And if you prevent yourself [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1000.96s)]
*  from solving those crises because you're afraid to lift sanctions on Venezuela, well, you may [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1005.92s)]
*  think you're avoiding short-term political pain, but you're inviting much bigger medium and long-term [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1010.96s)]
*  pain. The best politics is actually to solve the problem. And often in foreign policy, that means [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1015.28s)]
*  taking a short-term hit in exchange for a medium and long-term outcome. And that's what I hope, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1020.24s)]
*  really hope, we see in Latin America because this policy is ripe to change on Cuba, on Venezuela, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1025.76s)]
*  on a whole host of things, on drugs. And maybe, maybe if Bob Menendez is out of the way, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1030.96s)]
*  that'll become easier. I saw an NPR story the other day about three, I think Nigerian men, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1035.68s)]
*  who stowed away on a massive ship, on the keel of the ship. So they're outdoor, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1041.92s)]
*  exposed the elements on a constantly moving keel of a ship for 14 days because they were so desperate [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1048.48s)]
*  to get out of Nigeria and get to somewhere else. They ended up in Brazil. The point being, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1054.32s)]
*  you're never going to talk people out of trying to leave countries when they are in desperate [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1059.1200000000001s)]
*  circumstances. That's so true in Venezuela. Yeah. And this is why the Suella Braverman speech [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1064.08s)]
*  triggered me because there she is at AEI talking about using all means necessary to stop these [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1068.24s)]
*  boats in the English Channel. You're talking about Afghan families crossing the channel [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1073.28s)]
*  in little boats and you're talking about using all means necessary. Fix the problem, do your job. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1079.2s)]
*  It's really frustrating. All these people that demagogue this issue while creating the issue [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1085.12s)]
*  through their own policies, it is a terrible feedback loop. Yeah, it's wretched people. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1089.12s)]
*  Let's turn to Ukraine and Russia news then because there's lots of updates on that front. So [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1094.08s)]
*  last Friday, Ukraine carried out an attack on Russia's naval fleet. They struck a key [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1098.5600000000002s)]
*  command and communication center in Crimea. That strike, they said, killed a guy named Victor [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1103.1200000000001s)]
*  Sokolov, the commander of Russia's Black Sea fleet, along with 33 other officers. It's not [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1108.24s)]
*  clear if that's true because on Tuesday, the Russian Ministry of Defense put out a video [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1114.88s)]
*  that purported to show Sokolov alive, but we'll find out. I guess time will tell. Either way, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1118.48s)]
*  the Ukrainians keep hammering Russia's naval fleet. In response, the Russians targeted an [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1123.44s)]
*  important grain facility in Odessa. They're continuing this war on Ukraine's ability to [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1129.04s)]
*  feed the world. On the southern front of the war, Ukrainian troops have punched through Russia's [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1133.92s)]
*  defensive line, the Serovkin line, which is this multi-layered defensive line constructed by the [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1139.2s)]
*  Russian forces to prevent Ukrainian advances. Now they're going to see if they can widen that breach, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1143.76s)]
*  advance through it, and build on it. The US apparently has agreed at the end of last week [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1149.04s)]
*  when Slensky was here to give Ukraine these long-range US missiles called Atacams that they've [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1154.56s)]
*  wanted for a long time. It sounds like those will include cluster munitions on them. So another [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1160.0s)]
*  sort of example of that convention going away. The US made M1 Abrams tanks are finally in Ukraine. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1164.3999999999999s)]
*  Hopefully that'll help with this offensive. Though, Ben, I heard a military expert say [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1172.0s)]
*  the other day that the average lifespan of a tank in combat is usually less than two weeks [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1176.1599999999999s)]
*  before they are damaged or destroyed. So it just goes to the churn and why Ukrainians won a 300, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1182.32s)]
*  and we gave them 31, and they don't think that's enough. But some limited progress again by the [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1187.28s)]
*  Ukrainian side. But unfortunately now these exhausted Ukrainian troops have to fight their [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1193.1999999999998s)]
*  way to the next set of mines, to the next set of fortified defenses, and it's going to continue to [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1198.48s)]
*  be a brutal slog. But anything else you saw out there this week on that front? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1203.36s)]
*  No, I think that's right. There are these three lines of Russian defenses, and it's just a slog [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1207.6799999999998s)]
*  clearly to get through them. And that suggests more likely than not some version of a stalemate [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1213.52s)]
*  for a while. The attack on the Russian naval, that's characteristic of a couple of things. One, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1218.8s)]
*  the Ukrainians hitting Crimea more, and two, this almost targeted assassination. They seemed [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1226.88s)]
*  like they were going after this guy. Like we said, that's them trying to reach beyond that [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1234.64s)]
*  front line because they're unable to make a lot of progress there and try to change the trajectory [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1240.0s)]
*  of the war that way. One thing I did just note, Tommy, is that Elon Musk had apparently denied [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1244.72s)]
*  Starlark access to Ukraine because he thought that if they attacked the Russian fleet, it would [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1250.5600000000002s)]
*  start World War III. And Elon Musk's escalation risk analysis, not quite spot on because they're [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1254.48s)]
*  hitting all the same stuff anyway, and there's not nuclear weapons being used in response. So [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1261.28s)]
*  that is notable. Yeah. And in case we all need a reminder of the fact that Vladimir Putin is not [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1266.16s)]
*  just brutalizing the Ukrainians, but he's brutalizing a lot of his own people. An opposition [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1271.6s)]
*  leader and activist named Vladimir Karamurza has reportedly been transferred to a maximum security [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1275.84s)]
*  prison in Siberia. He got sentenced to 25 years in prison for denouncing the Russian invasion. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1280.48s)]
*  This is another brave activist who was, again, poisoned twice, once in 2015 and once in 2017. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1286.32s)]
*  I met that guy and he'd recently been poisoned. He also wrote for the Washington Post. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1293.52s)]
*  So actually, this is like the, you know, Khashoggi, our buddy Jason, resigned before [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1301.84s)]
*  the Post has had some people just to reminder this guy wasn't a conventional journalist, but [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1309.76s)]
*  just the dangers that some people are facing for things that would have been totally normal [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1315.6000000000001s)]
*  to be doing like 10 years ago. Yeah, just voicing your opinion. So I want to get to this [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1320.0s)]
*  DeSantis thing then because a while back, we covered allegations made by a former detainee [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1323.92s)]
*  at Guantanamo Bay prison about Ron DeSantis. It's a guy named Mansour Adhiafi. He alleged that [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1328.88s)]
*  DeSantis, while working as a junior officer in the military, he's a JAG at Gitmo, was part of a [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1334.96s)]
*  group that force-fed him to break a hunger strike. The New York Times looked into these allegations [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1341.1200000000001s)]
*  and found no evidence to back up the claims. Instead, they were repeatedly told by people who [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1347.1200000000001s)]
*  worked with DeSantis or worked at Gitmo that this almost certainly did not happen because [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1353.04s)]
*  DeSantis was very junior and very inexperienced and, you know, a young lawyer wouldn't be anywhere [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1357.8400000000001s)]
*  near a force-feeding. That doesn't mean that the force-feedings did not happen. They very much did. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1362.48s)]
*  Many other horrible things happened to these detainees, but DeSantis doesn't seem to have [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1368.96s)]
*  witnessed or participated in this process in any way. DeSantis did get detailed to Gitmo for these [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1374.16s)]
*  one to two weeks since his job was described as being equivalent to a first-year associate at a [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1381.44s)]
*  law firm making copies, kind of menial stuff. But in the past, DeSantis has defended Gitmo. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1386.32s)]
*  I think when we covered this at the time, we played an interview he did with a Florida outlet [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1393.6799999999998s)]
*  where he suggested that this force-feeding was just a way to combat ongoing jihad by detainees. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1398.32s)]
*  He talked about essentially their resistance to interrogation, et cetera, as an affront to [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1406.8799999999999s)]
*  him and not mistreatment of these detainees, but an important correction and clarification here. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1415.44s)]
*  Yeah, and it's important to get those facts straight. At the same time, I think the real [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1420.88s)]
*  scandal here, which is kind of lost in American politics now, is that one, Gitmo happened and all [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1425.6s)]
*  this torture and force-feeding and waterboarding happened. Two, that people like Ron DeSantis [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1435.3600000000001s)]
*  continued to defend it as if it was a good thing that happened. And then three, that it's still [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1441.2s)]
*  open and that we're paying God knows how much money a year to keep 50 people down there. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1445.44s)]
*  To me, it doesn't really raise the basic, but the problem is that probably every Republican [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1453.1200000000001s)]
*  candidate would defend Gitmo. DeSantis is a part as uniquely sadistic that he does so. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1457.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. Well, another big update. Last week, we talked about these shocking allegations [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1464.56s)]
*  that were made by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that agents of the Indian government [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1469.6s)]
*  carried out an assassination of a Sikh separatist on Canadian soil, a Canadian citizen. The Indian [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1474.4s)]
*  government angrily denied those accusations, but Canada also took a bunch of steps. They [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1480.6399999999999s)]
*  expelled the Indian intelligence operative who was living in Canada. The Indian government [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1486.16s)]
*  responded in kind. So we're now learning more about how the Canadians figured this out in the [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1490.8s)]
*  first place. They reportedly intercepted communications between Indian diplomats [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1495.84s)]
*  talking about the assassination. And as I think you sort of mentioned last week, Ben, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1500.8799999999999s)]
*  the US reportedly provided some intelligence to the Canadian government that helped them figure [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1505.1999999999998s)]
*  out what happened. It sounded like basically the Canadians informed us that or went public with [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1510.3999999999999s)]
*  this and the US intelligence community looked probably back into a big stack of intercepted [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1516.1599999999999s)]
*  communications, rifled through it and gave them stuff that was helpful. Jake Sullivan, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1521.2s)]
*  President Biden's national security advisor, was asked about the US response at a White House [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1526.16s)]
*  briefing. Here's a clip. I'm not going to get into the substance of private diplomatic conversations, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1530.32s)]
*  but we are in constant contact with our Canadian counterparts. We are consulting with them closely. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1534.72s)]
*  We support the efforts that they are undertaking in this investigation. And we have also been in [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1540.16s)]
*  touch with the Indian government as well. And I will leave it at that for today, only to say [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1544.4s)]
*  that I have seen in the press some efforts to try to drive a wedge between the United States and [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1548.88s)]
*  Canada on this issue. And I firmly reject the idea that there is a wedge between the US and Canada. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1553.92s)]
*  We have deep concerns about the allegations and we would like to see this investigation carried [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1560.0800000000002s)]
*  forward and the perpetrators held to account. That is what the United States has stood for from the [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1564.72s)]
*  moment this emerged in public. And we will continue to stand for that until this fully plays its way [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1570.5600000000002s)]
*  out. I'm curious, one, if you're seeing any wedges and two, you know, like if this was a fight between [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1575.2s)]
*  Canada and China, I'm pretty sure what would happen next is the Chinese would find a way to [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1581.28s)]
*  punish Canada. Yeah. Like banning the import of Canadian canola oil, which is what they did in [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1587.04s)]
*  2018 when there was a diplomatic fight. They banned it for three years, like a huge economic hit to [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1591.2s)]
*  the Canadians. But I'm not sure what the Indian government's playbook is going to be. Like where [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1595.8400000000001s)]
*  do you think this one goes? First of all, Jake is like better than anybody I know at saying the [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1599.6s)]
*  absolute road Diplo speak, but making it sound kind of dramatic. You know, look, I cannot get [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1606.9599999999998s)]
*  into the substance of sensitive conversation. You know, there's just kind of a constant, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1612.3999999999999s)]
*  there's like a drama behind it, you know. That's a praise there. But look, I think [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1616.56s)]
*  what we talked about last week is that the U.S. had to know about this from the five eyes, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1623.04s)]
*  from those are the five countries that have basically open book intelligence sharing, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1630.3999999999999s)]
*  the U.S., Canada, the UK, New Zealand, Australia. And so what was kind of strange to me when it [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1634.8799999999999s)]
*  first popped, to get to your point about wedges, when it first came out, the U.S. was kind of very, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1642.0s)]
*  it wasn't like a coordinated everybody go out together and say, we're really alarmed by this, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1648.0s)]
*  or the Canadians got first and then the U.S. is ready with a prepared statement that's like, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1653.3600000000001s)]
*  you know, we're deeply concerned about this. There was kind of a like, we should let the [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1656.96s)]
*  investigation go its way, you know. And one of the reasons I, like some other people were like, [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1662.4s)]
*  well, that's an interesting formulation is precisely because the U.S. probably has a view [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1667.0400000000002s)]
*  about what happened here. You know, like it'd be interesting if you are a member of Congress [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1672.16s)]
*  for instance, the Intelligence Committee, I'd be asking, what is the U.S. intelligence assessment [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1676.16s)]
*  of whether this happened? You know, because I would guess, and I don't know, I really don't [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1679.68s)]
*  know this, but I would guess that the U.S. has some X degree of confidence that X happened, you know. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1683.68s)]
*  Especially Indian diplomats were talking about the assassination in some sort of over way. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1690.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1694.72s)]
*  It doesn't leave a lot of room. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1695.04s)]
*  It doesn't leave a lot of room. And what was clearly like a professional hit, like, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1695.8400000000001s)]
*  it wasn't like a guy got hit by a car, it was like a bunch of gunmen. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1700.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and the videotape of the assassination had come out, it shows like this was like kind of [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1703.76s)]
*  military style. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1707.2s)]
*  Yeah, it was like a contract style hit, right. So, however, I will say, I think Jake did a lot of [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1707.68s)]
*  good work in that clip to clean this up, you know, or clean up, they may not have thought there was, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1714.32s)]
*  they may not have intended that, but, you know, it just felt like they didn't want to be leading [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1719.04s)]
*  with that, you know. As you and I have talked about, and this is no disrespect in the world [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1723.44s)]
*  to the wonderful role of NSC spokesperson, but sometimes when like the quote is in the name of [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1728.0800000000002s)]
*  the NSC spokesperson, you know, it's not in the name of the president or secretary of state or [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1732.72s)]
*  national affairs. Yeah, and so I think when Jake though comes out and basically says, no, there's [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1736.64s)]
*  no wedge, we're with them, we want to get to the bottom of it, I think that that is exactly the [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1743.76s)]
*  right answer. You could just tell that they weren't looking for this fight with the Indians. And maybe [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1747.44s)]
*  that's the message they wanted to send, you know, that we're going to end up being with the Canadians, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1753.68s)]
*  but we're going to show that we aren't like thrilled that this is happening. Now, where can they help [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1757.2s)]
*  is in terms of what's happening next. So in terms of punishment, the question you asked, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1761.5200000000002s)]
*  India's already indicated they're going to like not allow visas for Canadians to visit India, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1765.84s)]
*  which, you know, both undermines business, but it's kind of mean, because I'm sure there's a [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1771.84s)]
*  large Indian diaspora there that, you know, so I would hope that the role the US can play is I [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1777.36s)]
*  understand that the US is probably not going to be, you know, moody over the head with this, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1783.36s)]
*  because they have all these other interests with them, but to quietly go to them and be like, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1786.32s)]
*  don't do this, you know, like, let's figure out a way to reach some resolution here that doesn't [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1789.76s)]
*  involve you kind of punishing an ally of ours because you killed somebody there, you know, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1795.44s)]
*  like, hopefully that's the kind of quiet, intense diplomacy that can help the Canadians [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1800.3200000000002s)]
*  manage through this, you know? Well, I do. I mean, I wonder if the US will be forced [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1806.48s)]
*  to sanction individuals that we know are associated with this assassination under the Magnitsky Act, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1810.88s)]
*  or I don't know. I mean, it seems like I wonder if Congress will force our hand on any sense to [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1817.52s)]
*  that really, I mean, Modi has a lot of support in Congress, too, but like there are other issues [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1822.56s)]
*  that are raised by this. So for instance, like, I think we share intelligence with India, you know, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1825.76s)]
*  are there concerns about intelligence sharing with an intelligence service that may have carried out [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1830.8s)]
*  a contract in Canada, you know, like there are these kinds of incidents raise all these questions, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1835.68s)]
*  you know, in my sense, as the administration's trade officer, probably going to be towards [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1841.1200000000001s)]
*  not having a rift with India. But hopefully that can least include what Jake said, which is getting [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1845.68s)]
*  involved, what happened being clear about accountability and, you know, addressing this [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1851.36s)]
*  in some fashion. Our former mayor here in Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti, I think was pretty [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1854.8s)]
*  recently confirmed as a US ambassador to India. That's a big job, no matter what, but boy, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1859.6799999999998s)]
*  she's got a lot more complicated. Yeah, a lot more complicated. Ben, unfortunately, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1864.8s)]
*  it's been a tough couple of weeks for our friends in Canada. So last week, they welcomed Ukrainian [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1869.12s)]
*  president Vladimir Zelensky to the Canadian parliament to deliver a speech. This was a, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1875.12s)]
*  you know, broad effort to support Ukraine. Right. Trudeau announced a bunch of additional money. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1880.64s)]
*  They're going to send some armored vehicles to Ukraine as part of the event in parliament. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1885.6000000000001s)]
*  The speaker of the Canadian House of Commons, Anthony Rota, introduced a 98 year old man from [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1891.6000000000001s)]
*  his district named Yaroslav Hunkha, who the speaker described as a Ukrainian hero, a Canadian hero. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1898.64s)]
*  Here's a clip of that. We have here in the chamber today, Ukrainian Canadians, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1905.0400000000002s)]
*  Ukrainian Canadian world veteran from the second world war who fought the Ukrainian [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1909.52s)]
*  independence against the Russians and continues to support the troops today, even at his age of 98. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1915.28s)]
*  The speaker has acknowledged his mistake and has apologized, but this is something that is [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1932.0s)]
*  deeply embarrassing to the Parliament of Canada and by extension to all Canadians. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1938.4s)]
*  So that voice you heard at the end after the applause talking about the speaker's mistake was [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1942.8000000000002s)]
*  prime minister Justin Trudeau, because it turns out that this gentleman you heard them applauding [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1947.1200000000001s)]
*  fought in a volunteer unit under the command of the Nazis. Shortly before we started recording, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1952.64s)]
*  the speaker resigned. Ben, where do you think applauding a former member of the SS 14th Waffen [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1959.92s)]
*  Division before a speech by a Jewish president ranks on the list of the worst vetting mistakes [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1967.92s)]
*  in political history? That's immediately vaulting up to the top three. When you say fought in World [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1974.88s)]
*  War II against the Russians, how do you not know immediately it's someone who fought with the Nazis? [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1981.04s)]
*  What was the vet on this guy? Because it didn't take long for a lot of people to figure this out. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1988.16s)]
*  Right. Because this guy was not shy about the fact that he'd been in this unit. There are other guys [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1993.04s)]
*  in that unit that ended up in Canada. It's such a degree of incompetency. Did this person, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=1998.08s)]
*  was he set up by a staff member? It's literally a bunch of mild-mannered, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2006.72s)]
*  friendly Canadians standing up and giving a standing ovation to someone who was in the SS. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2012.56s)]
*  It's fucking crazy. That's some crazy, crazy shit. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2017.2s)]
*  Wasn't there an instance where, I think it was you or Faber, somebody almost used a turn of phrase [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2020.8s)]
*  during Obama's speech in Germany that was a famous Nazi slogan? Yes. Just to prove, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2025.36s)]
*  and some of you, I think maybe way back when I may have told this story, but just to prove that [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2032.3999999999999s)]
*  we could all be the Canadian speaker, anybody who works in politics. Mistakes happen. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2039.04s)]
*  When Obama went to Berlin in 2008, four years' president, he was going to address 250,000 Germans [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2042.96s)]
*  in this huge moment outside. Faber and I wrote the speech together. I was the speechwriter [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2049.04s)]
*  traveling. We had the end of the speech was this great story about the American candy bombers who [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2054.4s)]
*  dropped candy to children during the Berlin airlift. This German woman runs out in the street and [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2059.92s)]
*  yells in German this word that means, we are a community of fate. Actually, there's one word [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2065.2000000000003s)]
*  in German that means community of fate. We're like, oh, that's great. That's so Obama. We are [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2071.1200000000003s)]
*  the ones we've been waiting for, all that. That was the big ending was on this line. He was going [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2074.88s)]
*  to say it in German. I'm sitting there, I'm like, doesn't that one word really mean community of [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2079.84s)]
*  fate? I Google this word. Sure enough, that's what it means, but I see some Hitler references. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2084.48s)]
*  At first, I'm like, well, it's Germany. Maybe there's Hitler references. I call our Europe [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2091.28s)]
*  policy lead guy. I'm going to dime him out now because we love him, but it was Phil Gordon, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2096.96s)]
*  great dude. He's like, no, that doesn't ring any bells with me. I'm like, well, I'm going to call, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2102.88s)]
*  we had an interpreter for the speech and a great van staffer, Mark Levitt, remember that guy, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2108.48s)]
*  is with that guy. I'm like, hey, does he have any concerns about this word? The guy's like, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2113.36s)]
*  oh my God, he's so glad you asked. He's been worried about this. This word was the theme of [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2118.7200000000003s)]
*  Hitler's first speech to the Reichstag. I was like, will people know that? He's like, well, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2124.8s)]
*  German people know that. I had to go upstairs and tell Obama two hours before the speech that we [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2130.56s)]
*  had to change the whole ending because I almost put in this word that was basically a Hitler theme. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2137.36s)]
*  Hey man, better than telling him two hours after the speech. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2142.24s)]
*  Well, it's great that our boss who was smoking Marlboro Reds at the time, which probably helped, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2144.16s)]
*  but it's great that his reaction was to laugh hysterically. Other bosses would yell. It's [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2149.52s)]
*  actually a great Obama story that his instinct was to think that was funny, but it does show you [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2155.52s)]
*  even Nazis can avoid the vet. Listen man, history is complicated. Words have a lot of meaning, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2161.2000000000003s)]
*  intended or unintended, and you've got to be real careful. Rough week in Canada though. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2169.04s)]
*  When I saw that, I was like, oh, they couldn't even get the clean Zalansky visit, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2173.6s)]
*  which otherwise was pretty cool. Let's take a quick break. We come back. We are going to talk about [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2176.4s)]

*  All right, Ben. So Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman did a sit down interview with Brett Baer [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2316.6400000000003s)]
*  of Fox News. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2320.96s)]
*  That's a choice. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2321.84s)]
*  Yep, it is a choice going Fox. A very interesting one. So look, I don't fully track MBS's [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2322.56s)]
*  interviews, but this was like the first sit down I've seen him do with a Western outlet [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2328.08s)]
*  since his PR tour. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2332.4s)]
*  60 minutes thing, remember? [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2333.92s)]
*  Yeah, from the United States in 2017. That got him. We have this fawning credulous coverage. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2335.2s)]
*  And yeah, as you know, it made a lot of reporters look very stupid after MBS ordered the execution [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2341.44s)]
*  of Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. So I watched all of Brett's interview with MBS. It wasn't 2017 [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2346.4s)]
*  Tom Friedman or 60 Minutes bad. He covered a lot of ground. He asked about Khashoggi. He asked [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2353.92s)]
*  about some human rights things, but there was some bootlicking in there that was a little [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2358.56s)]
*  uncomfortable. But let's start with the biggest headline out of this interview when they talked [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2361.44s)]
*  about Iran. So here's MBS talking about what would happen if Iran got a nuclear weapon. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2367.12s)]
*  That means you are in a war with the rest of the world. So it's a useless effort to reach [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2372.4s)]
*  nuclear weapon because you cannot use it. If you use it, you got to have a big fight with [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2377.84s)]
*  the rest of the world. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2382.88s)]
*  If they get one, will you? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2383.6s)]
*  If they get one, we have to get one for security reason for balancing power in the Middle East. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2385.6s)]
*  But we don't want to see that. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2390.8s)]
*  So Ben, I heard that. And look, I could view that as kind of a threat, or I could view it as [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2391.84s)]
*  a statement of facts and frankly, something that Obama said many times, which is if Iran [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2398.0s)]
*  got a nuclear weapon, it would start an arms race in the Middle East. How did you receive that? [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2402.24s)]
*  I received it as a statement of fact. I mean, first of all, like they, as always, [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2409.04s)]
*  could have supported the Iran deal and then you wouldn't have to be having this conversation. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2416.24s)]
*  So that's endlessly frustrating that he and Bibi, these guys that actively undermine the [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2420.72s)]
*  Iran deal, are now bitching that the Iranians are on the doorstep of nuclear weapon that they [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2424.56s)]
*  wouldn't have been able to do. But I think it's just like we used to make this argument, like [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2428.08s)]
*  if Iran gets one, the Saudis will and others, the Saudis could buy one. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2433.84s)]
*  They have so much money, they could figure out a way to buy it. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2439.44s)]
*  I think the problematic, to use the 2023 term, piece of it is that we're in the middle of this [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2442.72s)]
*  negotiation about giving them a peaceful nuclear program. Right. And so that's on the table as [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2448.96s)]
*  part of this normalization deal. And for him to just announce, we might, because it would still, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2454.4s)]
*  they're not legally allowed to get a nuclear weapon just because Iran gets one. That may be [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2460.08s)]
*  what happens, but that would be in violation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty that would be [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2465.04s)]
*  against international law. So for him to basically just say, yeah, if this thing happens, it very [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2469.52s)]
*  well may happen. We're just going to immediately turn key and have a nuclear weapon. And oh, by [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2475.6800000000003s)]
*  the way, that'd probably be easier if the US builds me a large peaceful nuclear program. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2480.4s)]
*  That's why it's messed up. Just as him saying out loud, yeah, it's not like this nuclear program [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2486.2400000000002s)]
*  might not just be about peaceful nuclear power. It's a hedge. Yeah, that jumped out at me. I mean, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2492.8s)]
*  the same interview they talk about this normalization deal a bunch. And also, Brett [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2498.0s)]
*  Beren, the piece, talks about MBS's efforts to make peace with the Iranians, the deals for brokered [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2501.44s)]
*  by the Chinese in a way that's like, it's not fawning, but it's sort of like, you're praising [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2507.44s)]
*  him. But that other side of his mouth is always attacking Obama and the Iran deal. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2512.56s)]
*  Funny Brett Beren wasn't as fawning over our diplomacy with Iran. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2516.4s)]
*  No, he was not. So just to give him shit for a minute. So Brett starts the interview by saying, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2519.44s)]
*  a lot of people describe you as a visionary leader, including many of your own people. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2523.84s)]
*  Oh my God. You later, I think the next question starts. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2527.12s)]
*  Many people are saying. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2529.76s)]
*  You really have become a big player on the world stage. When talking about normalization, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2530.8s)]
*  he says, clearly you can see outside of the box on these deals. And then on Yemen, then they talk [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2535.04s)]
*  to his credit. Brett asks about the war in Yemen. But then he says, more than 150,000 people died in [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2540.72s)]
*  Yemen. It's been a big humanitarian crisis, but you all put in billions of dollars to help in that. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2548.24s)]
*  And it doesn't get covered a lot. It's like, thank you for sending some aid to manage the [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2553.44s)]
*  humanitarian catastrophe that the Saudis caused. Wonderful. Why not cover that more? [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2559.52s)]
*  That's so unbelievable because they completely created the humanitarian catastrophe. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2564.4s)]
*  The billions they provided in humanitarian assistance is like change in the couch for [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2569.2000000000003s)]
*  the Saudis. And that also, Tommy, doesn't that just sound like Brett Beren had to have multiple [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2574.1600000000003s)]
*  meetings with MBS's flax in order to secure this interview? And one of those flax, one of those [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2579.6800000000003s)]
*  really smooth Saudi diplomat types is like, you know what doesn't get covered? The prince really [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2585.12s)]
*  wants to make sure that we are providing this humanitarian assistance in Yemen and [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2593.36s)]
*  no one ever talks about it. He'd really like to talk about that. 100%. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2597.52s)]
*  Good work by that flax, by the way, because it's basically wrote Brett Beren's question. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2601.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's a 30 minute interview. The first part is kind of buttering him up. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2605.04s)]
*  17 minutes into discussion, he asks about Khashoggi, asks a follow up and then moves on, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2610.0s)]
*  though he does move on to whether or not the Saudis are going to lock up someone who tweeted [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2614.08s)]
*  something nasty about the government. The one thing that really bothered me, Ben, is [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2617.76s)]
*  Brett Beren is like, could you work with Bibi Netanyahu? And MBS says, look, you know, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2623.1200000000003s)]
*  like in Saudi Arabia, we don't interfere with who's running a country. We work with them. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2627.6000000000004s)]
*  No pushback on that. No mention that MBS took the president of Lebanon hostage. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2632.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And they didn't resign. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2637.2s)]
*  Removing governments. Yeah. One of the stranger episodes, too, by the way, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2641.2s)]
*  they took the prime minister of a country hostage. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2647.12s)]
*  And they drafted a statement for him and made him read it. It's the craziest shit I've ever seen. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2648.8799999999997s)]
*  Brett Beren asked MBS about Biden's age. MBS is actually surprisingly complimentary. He does [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2653.2s)]
*  also ask about the Saudis investing in Jared Kushner's fund and whether it sends a bad message. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2657.4399999999996s)]
*  Even if there wasn't a tit for tat, he sort of like takes away the worst outcome. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2663.52s)]
*  Basically, MBS says he leave the money in there even if Trump becomes president. So [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2668.0s)]
*  worth watching, but pretty frustrating. Yeah, pretty frustrating. I mean, this guy [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2672.8799999999997s)]
*  has like just floated above accountability of any sort because of his money. And, [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2677.2799999999997s)]
*  you know, that's the message sent by interviews like that. I mean, I do think part of what's going [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2682.0s)]
*  on here is, look, he clearly would prefer Trump coming back. Definitely. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2686.16s)]
*  Yeah. And precisely because everybody knows that, he can like say some nice things about [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2689.12s)]
*  Joe Biden and Fox News. And by the way, the reason they went to the normalization deal now [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2694.56s)]
*  is because they think that they did the deal with Trump as president. It would not get through [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2699.12s)]
*  Congress because no Democrats would vote for it. So the reason he's doing this is he wants to use [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2702.88s)]
*  Democratic votes under a Democratic president to muscle through his normalization package so he [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2707.68s)]
*  can have his nuclear program and security guarantee and then hug Trump, which is yet another reason [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2713.2799999999997s)]
*  I'd be skeptical of this deal if I was a Democrat. I'm real skeptical of this deal. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2717.76s)]
*  A couple more quick things before we get to Ben's interview. So we have been talked about Niger in [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2721.6800000000003s)]
*  a while. Folks remember the presidential guard in Niger stayed to coup on July 26. They've been in [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2725.1200000000003s)]
*  control ever since the Democratic elected president has been sitting in jail. The coup leaders told [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2731.0400000000004s)]
*  France right after it happened to get their ambassador and their 1500 troops the hell out [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2736.8s)]
*  of the country. Initially, French President Emmanuel Macron refused saying he would only [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2741.6800000000003s)]
*  take orders from Mohammed Bazum, the democratically elected president. On Sunday, Macron changed his [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2746.08s)]
*  mind and he announced that France will recall its ambassador immediately and pull out all of their [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2751.6s)]
*  troops by the end of the year. France was leading this big counterterrorism coalition in this hell [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2756.48s)]
*  region of Africa from about 2013 to 2022. At its peak, it spanned multiple countries and there were [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2762.72s)]
*  about 5000 soldiers there. They've been steadily driven out. This is sort of the latest step in [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2769.2799999999997s)]
*  that process. Now I guess we'll just see what the U.S. does. Yeah, I mean, I think this is the right [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2774.8s)]
*  call. Not that France had a lot of maneuvering room, but as we've talked about, they need to kind [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2779.84s)]
*  of reset this entire relationship they have with their former colonies in the Sahel region of Africa [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2785.2000000000003s)]
*  because one after another, there's a coup that basically has like anti-French sentiment as a key [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2790.4s)]
*  part of it. And so just instead of trying to stay there and figure something out, like just pulling [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2794.96s)]
*  out and be like, okay, we're kind of start this over. It's crazy that they were telling him to [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2799.84s)]
*  leave and they wouldn't. Yeah, I mean, that was the right thing to do. I think the U.S., I don't [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2803.2s)]
*  know, I mean, the U.S., they haven't said the same thing to us about getting out. No, I don't think [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2807.8399999999997s)]
*  we've called it a coup yet. Yeah, so I mean, personally, I kind of feel like we should get [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2815.12s)]
*  out of there because we're kind of enabling in some fashion a pretty shitty situation [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2820.08s)]
*  and there got to be other ways to manage like a terrorism threat from that part of the world. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2830.4s)]
*  Feels like by 2023, we should be able to not have to be physically everywhere. I mean, this is part [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2834.7200000000003s)]
*  of that dismantling forever or infrastructure, like are you going to keep a drum base in Niger [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2840.4s)]
*  forever? I mean, I don't think so. So, post-coup might be the time to pack it up. Yeah, it might be [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2844.88s)]
*  the time. So Ben, our former boss, Obama's first chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, is now the U.S. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2850.2400000000002s)]
*  ambassador to Japan. So we worked for Rahm. He was very super high functioning, frenetic, [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2858.7200000000003s)]
*  not afraid to break some china, not afraid to drop an F-bomb or piss people off, makes enemies. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2864.32s)]
*  Unabashed at NeoLib too. Unabashed at NeoLib. That reputation made Rahm's selection as an ambassador [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2869.5200000000004s)]
*  a little bit surprising to some people. Especially to like an incredibly structured and polite kind [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2878.0800000000004s)]
*  of society. Well, you know, it's funny. I do think part of the confusion, some of it is an assumption [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2882.8s)]
*  that ambassadors are polished and diplomatic. I do think sometimes countries want ambassadors [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2888.48s)]
*  that just are perceived as having power and access and like Rahm certainly fits that bill. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2895.76s)]
*  I don't know. Either way, NBC News reported that the White House had to scold Rahm Emanuel [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2899.76s)]
*  for sending a bunch of tweets that taunted Chinese president Xi Jinping because they were worried [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2907.1200000000003s)]
*  they might undermine efforts to improve relations between the U.S. and China. So the White House [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2912.08s)]
*  denied this happened on the record. Kirk Campbell, who was on the show a couple weeks back, has this [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2916.4s)]
*  like glowing quote about Rahm. I bet. Probably dictated by Rahm. I talked to some folks in [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2920.7999999999997s)]
*  the administration who said, you know, look, they're doing their job and pushing back on a [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2927.04s)]
*  story that annoyed people. They said they think Rahm's doing a pretty good job, but he certainly [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2931.2s)]
*  seems to have pissed off some folks at the State Department, some professional diplomats. So I [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2934.4s)]
*  don't know. Regardless, there is no doubt in my mind that if back in 2009 we were sitting in the [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2938.96s)]
*  White House and our ambassador to Japan started popping off on the Chinese president on Twitter, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2945.12s)]
*  Rahm would have ripped him a new asshole. But I guess my question to you is like, there has been [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2951.52s)]
*  this change in diplomacy starting sort of the Xi Jinping area, these so-called wolf warrior diplomats [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2958.0s)]
*  who are lots of Chinese officials who talk shit on social media all day every day for living about [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2965.12s)]
*  the U.S. in particular. Do we think any of this really matters given that change or like, I don't [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2970.24s)]
*  know, how big a deal, how big of a concern would you have about Rahm, you know, popping off about, [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2975.8399999999997s)]
*  you know, the missing Chinese foreign minister and defense minister on Twitter? I mean, it's first [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2981.6s)]
*  of all, it's just funny that Rahm is an ambassador. By the way, he had like the strangest, people are [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2987.92s)]
*  always like, you know, did he curse a lot? And yeah, the answer is yes. But it was always been [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2994.88s)]
*  the strangest way to be like, you know, get me the secretary of motherfucking agriculture. And it's [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=2999.84s)]
*  like, why? Like, why is that guy a motherfucker? You know, like, it was just kind of random cursing, [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3005.12s)]
*  you know, like, so I'm trying to picture that in Japan. On the, on the, the other thing about the [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3009.92s)]
*  Xi Jinping stuff, Biden goes to these like, fundraisers and he'll be like, I wouldn't want [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3015.92s)]
*  to be Xi Jinping, that loser. Like, Biden is constantly like throwing haymakers at Xi Jinping. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3022.08s)]
*  So maybe Rahm kind of felt like he had the top cover in this race. As a general matter, [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3028.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm a supporter of diplomats and ambassadors and US government officials sounding like normal human [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3032.48s)]
*  beings. I mean, it probably doesn't have to be through shitposting, but like, I really like and [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3039.36s)]
*  I've said this, I'll say, I'll say this publicly, I've said it privately to everybody. From Tony [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3045.36s)]
*  Blinken on down, like the talking points, you know, that we kind of live by in foreign policy, [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3051.76s)]
*  no human being sounds like that. No human being says words like today we reaffirmed and deepen [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3059.6800000000003s)]
*  the partnership, but you know, like, it's not how human beings talk. So I'm actually, I am a fan of [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3066.6400000000003s)]
*  ambassadors and people generally in the US government sounding like human beings and if [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3073.2s)]
*  that means they're going to throw a little shade at Xi Jinping from time to time, like, [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3079.04s)]
*  I think that's fine. I think you don't want to, the wolf warrior stuff that the Chinese do, [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3083.04s)]
*  the reason I think that's too much is it makes you kind of look weak, you know, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3088.0s)]
*  it's kind of crazed. It's like this deranged rants about America and like it doesn't, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3092.56s)]
*  it like it sounds thin skinned, you know? Yeah, that's true. I guess I'm with you. I just kind [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3098.2400000000002s)]
*  of find the whole thing funny. It's fine. I find the whole thing funny. I mean, just picture Grom, [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3103.44s)]
*  like firing off like, you know, dunks on the Chinese foreign ministers. Yeah. And like some [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3107.0400000000004s)]
*  poor assistant secretary of state for Asia waking up and reading it. Dan Cridenbring, man, like one [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3111.36s)]
*  of the best guys in the US government. This guy works for me. This guy works for my underlings, [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3116.32s)]
*  underlings, underlings, and he's just like popping off. Dan Cridenbring, he was after you. He replaced [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3119.76s)]
*  Danny Russell as assistant secretary. He's the most, he's the most like he's from Nebraska, [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3123.92s)]
*  wholesome, wonderful guy. So like Rom is probably like totally off his sensibilities in a number [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3130.16s)]
*  of ways. Rom and the State Department, it's an interesting culture fit. Yeah, yeah. That's [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3136.0s)]
*  what they say. Final story, Ben. A New Zealand couple was awarded $1,400 in compensation from [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3139.28s)]
*  the Singapore Airlines after they were forced to leave their premium seats and move to economy [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3145.84s)]
*  seats because they were seated next to a loud farting dog. This was a 13 hour flight from [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3151.76s)]
*  Paris to Singapore. According to People Magazine, my source here, the trouble began after the dinner [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3157.44s)]
*  service, as it often does. This dog was a bulldog mix. Apparently the dog, it was like underneath [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3162.6400000000003s)]
*  the owner's seat, but it's sort of, I think, butt was kind of angled under the neighbor's seat. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3170.5600000000004s)]
*  You know what happens next. So, you know, this couple fought and fought and fought for the money. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3176.4s)]
*  They said they'll donate it to a New Zealand based charity that matches visually impaired people with [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3180.64s)]
*  service dogs. So all's well that ends well. I have questions. Did the dog eat the dinner? Is that [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3185.36s)]
*  something that the dog had like the Singapore or like, because it's actually a good dinner on [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3190.48s)]
*  Singapore. They have good food. But maybe the dog's eating like some spicy noodles or something. That's [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3194.7200000000003s)]
*  not going to be good. Yeah. If you're giving them some sort of like heavily sauced microwave chicken, [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3199.44s)]
*  that's not what you want. That'll do it. Did you see, I'm sure you did, the diarrhea plane? Oh, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3204.32s)]
*  God. Yeah. I mean, did I ever. Because it kind of, this calls it to mind because [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3210.0800000000004s)]
*  I imagine if this dog like ate the microwave chicken dinner, it wasn't just the people sitting [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3216.1600000000003s)]
*  right there that are going to be impacted by what this dog was doing. I mean, these New Zealanders [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3221.2000000000003s)]
*  were like on the front lines, but there's some fucking people right behind them probably didn't [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3226.2400000000002s)]
*  appreciate that either. It's like snakes on a plane or something. 13 hour flight. I mean, [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3230.48s)]
*  the dog was supposed to hold it that time, that whole time. That's a really long flight for a [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3237.28s)]
*  tornado. It's a very good question. Like, what do you do with like animals on 13 hour flights? [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3241.84s)]
*  I mean, so I've taken my dog on six or seven hour flights, even when she was a puppy. And we brought [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3247.28s)]
*  like pee pads and try to get her to go in the bathroom. Sometimes she would, sometimes she [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3253.6s)]
*  would. I mean, they can hold it a shockingly long time, but 13 hours is a lot. Yeah. God, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3258.32s)]
*  that's a lot. Now when we got Luca, we flew with her a couple of weeks after we got her, [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3262.88s)]
*  so she was like 10 or 12 weeks. And we were sitting Southwest and basically like someone saw [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3268.0800000000004s)]
*  me in the window seat, Hannah in the middle, and then like an open aisle seat next to like, [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3276.7200000000003s)]
*  you know, Hannah's small. So you have a, you're not fighting for the armrest. This younger woman [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3282.8s)]
*  comes and sits and sits down and then she sees that we have our little like 12 week old puppy [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3287.36s)]
*  on the tray table, just like racked out. So yeah, yeah. Best day of her life. Yeah. Pet her the whole [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3291.76s)]
*  time. No farting though. Yeah. That's a good seat. You get to be next to Hannah and a puppy. Yeah. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3297.36s)]
*  You get lots of arm room. It's a lot of happy time. But yeah, so I guess no 13 hour flights. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3304.4s)]
*  Just don't feed the dogs the people food on the flights. I think that's what we can take away [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3310.1600000000003s)]
*  from this. That's what we learned. We learned from this. Okay. We are going to take a quick break [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3314.72s)]

*  Armenia's borders. And so she's here to help us understand what's happening and where things [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3561.1200000000003s)]
*  might be going now. So thanks so much for joining us today. Oh, I'm so happy to join you, but I wish [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3568.4s)]
*  we could have a different reason for to have this conversation. I know, I know, so do I. And [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3573.44s)]
*  it's just kind of been a heartbreaking turn of events. I mean, to begin with, [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3579.84s)]
*  describe for our listeners why what has just happened, you know, and why, why from your [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3584.88s)]
*  understanding did this just happen now? So in other words, this has been a disputed territory [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3591.6800000000003s)]
*  for so long. Why does it seem like Azerbaijan has now made its move to kind of swallow up this [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3595.76s)]
*  region and and displace, if not ethnically cleanse all of these people? It was the middle of the day, [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3602.0s)]
*  September 19, when Azerbaijan started a military operation in Nagorno-Karabakh. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3608.88s)]
*  It took them very little, almost like it was a matter of hours for the Azerbaijani troops to [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3614.8s)]
*  destroy what the locals, the local Armenians call their own army. And then and they took control of [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3620.32s)]
*  the main roads that are connecting Stepanakert, which is the main town in Uzynklaj with the rest [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3627.52s)]
*  of the region. The capital, the main town, got encircled by the Azerbaijani troops. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3633.68s)]
*  The local authorities right away almost immediately started calling for the ceasefire. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3642.3999999999996s)]
*  And it took most of the time of this military operation that lasted for officially for one day. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3647.7599999999998s)]
*  But in fact, I mean, everything was more or less done within a couple of hours. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3655.2799999999997s)]
*  But most of the time it went only for the local authorities and the Azerbaijani government to [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3662.4s)]
*  basically decide how to proceed with the ceasefire, because Azerbaijan was asking not just for the [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3668.64s)]
*  dismantlement of the local military troops, but also they wanted to see that the local government [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3674.1600000000003s)]
*  basically announcing that they don't exist anymore. But then there was a question, who would be [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3682.0s)]
*  responsible for implementation of the ceasefire statement? And so it took a long [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3688.0s)]
*  one day just because they were busy clarifying how to proceed with the demands that Azerbaijan [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3696.08s)]
*  posed and the local authorities agreed to right away. When the announcement came, [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3705.2s)]
*  when the de facto authorities said that the ceasefire was agreed, it led to enormous panic [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3711.76s)]
*  among the local population, around 100,000 people. They were on the ground. Thousands were already [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3718.56s)]
*  displaced by the fighting that was taking place. But I mean, right away, people just started walking [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3725.12s)]
*  in all different directions, trying to find any kind of cover because they were all afraid that [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3732.6400000000003s)]
*  the Azerbaijani troops know where to start entering their villages and towns and that would [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3739.44s)]
*  lead to certain violence, tensions, massacres and all of that. Many of these people, they were [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3744.56s)]
*  walking kilometers, including very old people and also mothers with kids, just to find a cover [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3750.56s)]
*  at the bases and compounds of the Russian peacekeepers. So at some point, all these [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3758.64s)]
*  people, they found themselves in an open sky without any kind of food, without any kind of [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3765.04s)]
*  belongings, many without any kind of documents and then with no clarity about the future. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3770.16s)]
*  It took Azerbaijan about two days to agree to opening the road, the only road that connects [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3775.52s)]
*  Nagorno-Karabakh with the region to Armenia. And the moment it happened, we started seeing rivers [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3782.8s)]
*  of cars. All the people started moving towards Armenia and it is still going on. Azerbaijani [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3789.28s)]
*  bodyguards that are stationed at the border of Armenia, they're checking every single car. And [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3796.32s)]
*  because of that, people spend over a day just moving along with road that normally should take [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3802.0s)]
*  a couple of hours. And the first people now are here in Armenia. Today, almost 50,000 people [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3810.1600000000003s)]
*  already got registered. I spoke to several people who I know very well. None of them registered. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3818.8s)]
*  So I would probably expect a bigger number. I mean, those who are coming, many more are still on the [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3825.84s)]
*  move. They are packing. There are also people who are still looking for diesel or petrol or some [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3832.88s)]
*  leaves, some buses. I have a feeling that in the coming days, this region will become almost empty. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3840.72s)]
*  So maybe there will be some people who will decide to stay and this is their choice. But [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3851.2s)]
*  the majority, they don't see their future in Nagorno-Karabakh anymore, unfortunately. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3857.8399999999997s)]
*  I mean, that's a really astonishing and heartbreaking picture that you just painted. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3864.08s)]
*  Part of what is so astonishing, I think, to some people is that this has been a kind of frozen [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3871.36s)]
*  conflict for decades with roughly 150,000 Armenians living in this space. When you step back and [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3875.6s)]
*  consider why did this happen so fast? We saw President Liev of Azerbaijan with Erdogan [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3884.96s)]
*  the other day. Clearly, his deep relationship with Turkey and the military assistance he's gotten [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3894.16s)]
*  has improved their capabilities. The Russians have generally been in the corner of Armenia and [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3899.68s)]
*  Russian peacekeepers were kind of relied upon to enforce this status quo around Nagorno-Karabakh. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3905.92s)]
*  Clearly, Russia has been distracted by the war in Ukraine. Or you just have a world in which [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3912.24s)]
*  big countries are doing this, smaller countries as Russia is doing in Ukraine. Why do you think [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3918.3199999999997s)]
*  this happened now in a way that it hasn't happened for decades? Why was Azerbaijan both willing and [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3923.6s)]
*  able to do this so quickly? So look, the first change, it came in 2020, almost exactly three [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3930.72s)]
*  years ago. Then Azerbaijan started with military operation. The world was busy with pandemic. The [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3936.72s)]
*  U.S. was having elections. Trump's administration, they did not really care about this part of the [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3943.2799999999997s)]
*  world altogether. It took them six weeks. The Azerbaijani forces, they captured most of the [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3949.2799999999997s)]
*  conflict zone, including parts of Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenian army was absolutely destroyed. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3958.08s)]
*  It was basically the locals that were left at the mercy of the Russian peacekeepers. At that time, [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3965.44s)]
*  Moscow decided to station them in Nagorno-Karabakh for at least five days. Everything was more or [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3970.88s)]
*  less okay, I should say. There were the people who were telling me that they don't like certain [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3977.92s)]
*  things, especially that the military troops are next door. They can see them from their windows, [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3984.4s)]
*  that they don't feel safe about their kids. Nagorno-Karabakh became much more isolated [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3990.08s)]
*  because there were no more people from outside the world traveling there. Some restrictions were [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=3995.92s)]
*  imposed and all of that. But still, life went on. But the moment Russia started the invasion of [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4002.4s)]
*  Ukraine, everything started, it all started changing on the ground. People felt it there [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4008.48s)]
*  right away. Azerbaijan could feel right away also very well that Russia would never really start [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4016.56s)]
*  opening the second front. They were busy in Ukraine. Then Azerbaijan started making use of its [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4025.84s)]
*  military might. Also, the fact that Russia is either distracted, doesn't want to get involved, [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4033.7599999999998s)]
*  or just kind of prefers not to see what's happening, both at Nagorno-Karabakh, but also [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4039.68s)]
*  at the border with Armenia and Azerbaijan. There were many attempts, robust attempts, I should say, [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4045.28s)]
*  made by the European Union and also by the current administration of the United States. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4052.96s)]
*  I would say that they did everything possible. The fact that we had military operations only now, [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4058.0s)]
*  it's just because they got involved. They were going after with officials in Armenia and Azerbaijan. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4064.4s)]
*  They were making all these offers. There were calls. I had a feeling because the people just [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4072.0s)]
*  always foreign diplomats, they didn't have a vacation just because they were going after [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4078.56s)]
*  Armenia and Azerbaijan all the time. With negotiations that started between Armenia and [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4083.2s)]
*  Azerbaijan on the peace treaty, they were promising in a way that they were offering some [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4089.28s)]
*  prospect for peace, at least less stability during this difficult period when Russia is in Ukraine. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4098.64s)]
*  Everyone is also from outside the world. They are trying to respond to what's happening there. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4105.92s)]
*  But yeah, look, we still reached this point when it was necessary for Azerbaijan to go for some [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4110.320000000001s)]
*  softer stance and probably concede on some of its positions when it comes to Nagorno-Karabakh. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4119.4400000000005s)]
*  So for example, the United States and the European Union, they were offering to launch [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4128.64s)]
*  the negotiations between Baku and Stepanakert, de facto authorities and Azerbaijani officials [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4134.320000000001s)]
*  on the future of enclave so that they sit down and discuss how with reintegration starts happening. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4139.6s)]
*  And with the facto authorities agreed, they started developing their papers, [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4147.52s)]
*  position, agenda. And there were two attempts to make it happen. American officials were to take [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4153.12s)]
*  both the facto official and Azerbaijani representatives to Europe for a meeting. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4160.719999999999s)]
*  First time it was disrupted by the leaks to the Russian media. The second time we saw Russian [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4165.28s)]
*  foreign ministry making all different offers to Azerbaijan that were much more attractive than what [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4171.759999999999s)]
*  the US was suggesting. To me, when it happened in June and July, it was clear that we were doomed [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4177.36s)]
*  for escalation, to be honest. It was just a matter of time when it was to happen. But still, [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4185.12s)]
*  all these people, they spent their summer going after with Azerbaijani Armenian officials. We had [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4192.719999999999s)]
*  the most senior people from Brussels and Washington DC calling. And I understand that, for example, [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4199.44s)]
*  Secretary Blinken spoke to Aleph. And one of my sources at the US administration told me that [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4206.08s)]
*  they even discussed the possibility of sanctions in case this military operation happens. European [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4213.36s)]
*  official who is involved in all of that also confirmed that President Aleph personally promised [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4218.64s)]
*  not to go for this kind of military operation. And then they saw what was happening when with UN [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4226.08s)]
*  General Assembly, with annual thing was happening, when all these people were together in New York. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4232.72s)]
*  It was much more than anyone could expect. On the one hand, the fighting that everyone knew [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4239.4400000000005s)]
*  what it would bring, but on the other is also how it was done, despite all the promises and [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4249.2s)]
*  the UNGA happening. Yeah, it's almost like they wanted people to know, to watch, that they didn't [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4255.84s)]
*  care, that Azerbaijan is a stronger party now and they're going to do what they want. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4261.68s)]
*  So you paint a picture of pretty intense diplomatic activity. The Armenian American community here is [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4265.84s)]
*  understandably upset. And I think the mood is that they would have liked the US to do more. They [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4272.72s)]
*  would have liked the US to cut off any military assistance to Azerbaijan earlier. They would have [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4278.8s)]
*  liked sanctions. What more do you think? History is over, but this is still an ongoing situation. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4283.4400000000005s)]
*  Azerbaijan is still threatening maybe even further encroachments into Armenia. What do you think the [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4291.04s)]
*  United States can and should be doing now to support Armenia as it deals with not only these [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4296.4s)]
*  people coming in, but continued threats from Azerbaijan? Look, Azerbaijan is not very easy [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4303.44s)]
*  to work with. It's not like Washington DC calls them and then they in Azerbaijan right away start [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4308.24s)]
*  doing the things. So you have to work with them. And then I perfectly understand all these people [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4314.32s)]
*  who are so much frustrated. The administrator of the USAID, Samantha Power, she is now in Armenia [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4323.12s)]
*  and she constantly has to respond to these very questions. You promised us that there was a red [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4331.36s)]
*  line. You told us that you would respond. Where is your help? We don't need your money. Why didn't [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4336.96s)]
*  you help us? I don't want even to imagine what these people have to go through. But on the other [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4343.12s)]
*  hand, with our legit questions. In fact, we have this situation where work could happen a year ago [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4350.96s)]
*  with the US and EU involvement and all of that. I know that. That does not necessarily mean that [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4361.599999999999s)]
*  everyone knows that. And then people are very much frustrated with the fact that Russian peacekeepers [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4366.88s)]
*  just packed and left all their observation points. And they are now the only force on the ground. And [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4374.24s)]
*  there is no prospect for changing them or even adding anything. So you really have to look at [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4380.56s)]
*  the situation and then think about some sober approach and stance there. And I would say that [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4386.24s)]
*  the biggest and the most important priority now. Oh, I know that people will not like what I'm [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4393.92s)]
*  going to say, but it's still for Armenia and Azerbaijan to proceed with the peace talks. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4399.76s)]
*  There are two very important things for them still to discuss. One is the delimitation of the [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4405.36s)]
*  border and the second is the transportation roads. Both of them, they have to do with [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4411.52s)]
*  security of Armenia. If Azerbaijan now says no to the US and EU mediation, [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4416.4800000000005s)]
*  on these two important points, Armenia is left with only choice to go for these discussions [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4422.64s)]
*  with the Russian mediation. And then Russia does not really keep its back. And even more on some [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4428.160000000001s)]
*  of these issues, we know that Russia supports Azerbaijan position. And so in a way, you know, [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4433.76s)]
*  with this kind of situation when, yeah, it was a bad choice, but you have to think about some worse [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4440.56s)]
*  things that can happen if you don't go for that. And this is because just so people know, [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4448.48s)]
*  essentially there is a part of Azerbaijan that is still cut off by Armenian territory. And so [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4454.4s)]
*  the worst case scenario would be Azerbaijan taking more of Armenia's territory in order to create a [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4461.759999999999s)]
*  kind of land bridge, which is eerily familiar to Ukraine. So yes, this is still very much not over. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4468.32s)]
*  So you're in Yerevan. What is the mood there? I mean, you know, I've been struck by there's both [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4476.56s)]
*  the sense of loss of this territory that, you know, really intense war was fought over [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4484.320000000001s)]
*  at the end of the Soviet Union. Obviously, the ethnic Armenians and Christians in that territory, [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4492.0s)]
*  you know, basically being ethnically cleansed. But also you have the historical memory of genocide [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4499.44s)]
*  in Armenians. It feels like it makes this kind of trauma even more intense. And this sense of [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4506.0s)]
*  insecurity, as you said, it's just surrounded by these countries that seem hostile to its interest. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4512.959999999999s)]
*  I mean, what is the mood in Yerevan right now? I think many people are lost because it was very [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4517.44s)]
*  fast. And right away, you now see with people, people are in the locals, they are sorry about [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4523.04s)]
*  what happened. But at the same time, I don't see anyone who wants to get into the fighting, [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4531.2s)]
*  you know, I mean, there are those who are criticizing, for example, the Armenian leadership [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4537.84s)]
*  for their decision not to interfere into the fighting. I mean, people like me understand very [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4542.08s)]
*  well that it would be a very short fight even for Armenia itself, just because it doesn't really [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4547.28s)]
*  have an army and it doesn't have a backing of Russia. It's kind of formal military ally. So [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4553.759999999999s)]
*  it was not something that Armenia could afford at all. But there were some protests. And then, [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4561.759999999999s)]
*  to be honest, I mean, when I went to see with protests, I could not really feel that they were [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4569.04s)]
*  something that could bring a major change. Like I was sitting, for example, I was meeting one of the [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4574.64s)]
*  EU officials at a cafe and nearby was protesters were passing and they were shouting on those [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4581.4400000000005s)]
*  standing at the streets, come and join us. And right away, those are no, we're not going to do [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4589.84s)]
*  it. Some's very worse, you know. So it's from the very beginning to me, it was clear that [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4596.0s)]
*  the protest, they have a chance, but little potential. It can change. It can change in case [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4601.12s)]
*  of with humanitarian crisis that Armenia might face just because it now has to find housing [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4607.84s)]
*  and integrate a huge number of people who are different, who speak a different language. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4616.08s)]
*  They are Armenians, but they are not local Armenians. It's still a very difficult task. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4621.04s)]
*  And the second also, if, for example, some new escalation incidents start taking place at the [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4627.92s)]
*  border, that's also something that will undermine the Armenian leadership. And look, the winter is [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4632.72s)]
*  coming. Russia is the one that is providing natural gas to Armenia. Russia is the one that provides [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4639.36s)]
*  also the market. And we know very well, you know, when there are some political problems, right away, [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4646.08s)]
*  there can be some issues with, for example, some explosions on the pipeline, or there can be [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4652.64s)]
*  problems with some, I don't know, quality of some of the Armenian products that are to enter the [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4660.240000000001s)]
*  Russian market. So, I mean, it's okay for the moment. It's more or less stable. People are [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4667.360000000001s)]
*  watching. They are sorry, but what is to come? I think everyone is really very afraid of [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4676.88s)]
*  with next weeks and then months that are to come. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4684.48s)]
*  Yeah, I bet. But I think you really appropriately reminded us that this isn't over yet. You know, [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4687.599999999999s)]
*  that there's going to need to be a lot of assistance for those 150,000 people, assuming that's how many [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4694.32s)]
*  people come. We're talking about a country, Armenia, of less than 3 million people. So that's an [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4700.08s)]
*  enormous influx. There's a risk of continued conflict. The need for US and European assistance [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4704.32s)]
*  remains very high, even if the frustration with how Nagorno-Karabakh has played out [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4714.96s)]
*  is understandable. The last thing I just wanted to ask you, what have you heard about this explosion [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4719.84s)]
*  that took place at like a fuel depot where people are fleeing? It just seems to, does that feel like [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4725.759999999999s)]
*  a natural, like an accident or does your people feel like this is further efforts to sabotage and [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4733.92s)]
*  kind of humiliate and punish Armenians on the way out? You know, I spoke to some people who told me, [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4742.96s)]
*  I mean, who are still on the ground, who told me that they don't really have a reason to believe [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4751.36s)]
*  that that was something that was prepared by someone. Yeah. So I probably have to explain that [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4756.88s)]
*  Nagorno-Karabakh has been living with this blockade imposed by Azerbaijan for over nine months [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4765.68s)]
*  by the time of the military operation. There were very huge problems with the food, but also, [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4773.2s)]
*  not only, but also petrol, diesel. And when people saw that the road was open between Nagorno-Karabakh [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4780.0s)]
*  and Armenia, then right away you could see them running around the town and then in a search of [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4788.0s)]
*  this, you know, petrol that either Russian peacekeepers delivered or some set Azerbaijan [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4794.48s)]
*  delivered, no one cared. It was unfortunate. It was a very unfortunate incident when people were [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4799.52s)]
*  in a rush and they were trying to get petrol and diesel just to get out of Nagorno-Karabakh, [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4806.48s)]
*  because they are so much terrified. I don't know, I spoke to some people, you know, who have been [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4812.5599999999995s)]
*  packing yesterday and the feeling that I have is that they don't really have a hope that they will [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4819.44s)]
*  go back. Like, for example, one woman, she was burning, she packed some of her belongings, [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4827.04s)]
*  not much, but still, I mean, she was burning family photos and she kept the door open just because [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4836.88s)]
*  she thought that those who were to come and to leave at her apartment, they should probably enter [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4843.2s)]
*  a nice place. I heard that some others also telling me that they were cleaning their houses, [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4850.8s)]
*  because, you know, there is this kind of feeling saying that if you are abandoning your house, [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4856.16s)]
*  the new host should come to the clean place. It all sounds terrible. And also for those who [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4862.96s)]
*  not just now have to start a new life, but also just because in this military operation, [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4872.72s)]
*  many also lost their sons and husbands. The majority of those who died, they were military, [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4880.08s)]
*  but we were military who were also at the same time local residents. And then there are still [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4888.4s)]
*  those who are trying to find the corpses and the remains of their beloved ones, and then still kind [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4894.96s)]
*  of, you know, trying to keep with petrol and diesel next to them. And of course, with [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4904.4800000000005s)]
*  explosion, it was like an additional tragedy just because, yeah, people were trying to flee [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4910.88s)]
*  and suddenly what happened and you got like almost 300 people injured, some of them really very badly [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4917.200000000001s)]
*  and over 20 killed. So it's like an additional thing when you absolutely lose any kind of hope [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4926.48s)]
*  for a better future, I'm afraid. Yeah, no, that makes sense. Well, look, we really appreciate you [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4934.24s)]
*  coming on and helping us understand what's happening there. Everybody should follow the [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4939.2s)]
*  International Crisis Group's work is usually a very best analysis of these kind of conflict zones. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4942.959999999999s)]
*  And people should follow you, Alicia, on social media will point people in that direction. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4948.32s)]
*  So thanks so much and best of luck to you. Thank you. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4952.639999999999s)]
*  Thanks again to Alessia Vartinyan for joining the show. No thank you to Mack Jones or [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4955.68s)]
*  their guys, Zach. No, I will say thank you to a friend of the pod, Andy Kim. Oh, yeah, he might [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4962.4800000000005s)]
*  have had in the ring against Menendez. So this is hard. Everyone loves Andy Kim. I'm excited [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4969.360000000001s)]
*  for him to run. I bet it's going to be a crowded primary and people get real pissed off in democratic [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4976.72s)]
*  primaries. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We all learned in 2020. So yeah, we'll see. But I do hope [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4982.4s)]
*  that Menendez resolves. Yeah, someone can replace him. Yeah, that would be I'm not holding my breath [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4988.879999999999s)]
*  on that one. But we'll see. Like I like I just want to be clear. As I said, I'm part of America. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4992.799999999999s)]
*  I thought that guy sucked before. It was cool. Yeah. So did I have a long record. We have a pretty [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=4997.5199999999995s)]
*  good track record. I mean, if you've been listening, let's say you picked this show up in 18, you would [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=5003.839999999999s)]
*  have known how much we thought Jared Kushner sucked. Bibi Nanyahu sucked. MBS sucked. Bob Menendez. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=5008.8s)]
*  I feel like we've basically been proven. We may not be right about all of our prescriptions for [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=5016.08s)]
*  things, but I think our antenna for who sucks the most is pretty, pretty spot on. I think that's [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=5021.28s)]
*  right. I do think all of those people would be pleased to be bucketed together. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=5026.400000000001s)]
*  That's fair. That's true. They all like get the last laugh some out. Yeah. Listen, great show. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=5032.400000000001s)]
*  Thanks, everybody, for listening and talk to you next week. Yeah. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLltKExSt30&t=5038.8s)]
