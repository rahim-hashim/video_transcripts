Video Description: Tommy Vietor and Ben Rhodes take a break from impersonating Marco Rubio to cover Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to Washington to kiss Trump’s ass, the ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas in Qatar, the IDF’s latest plan to ethnically cleanse Gaza, and shifting opinions on Israel within the Democratic Party. They also discuss Trump’s confusing about-face on sending weapons to Ukraine, the continued incoherence of Trump’s tariff policy and his needless antagonism of the BRICS countries. Finally, they talk about the finger-wagging at Tucker Carlson for his interview with Iran’s president, the border crisis in Afghanistan, the Dalai Lama’s succession plan and how China could interfere, the dispute between Thailand and Cambodia that’s caused a political meltdown in Bangkok, and the administration’s cruel termination of Temporary Protected Status for Hondurans and Nicaraguans. Then, Ben speaks with Representative Jason Crow about how the “Big Beautiful Bill” will tank America’s global standing, intelligence in the age of Trump and Tulsi Gabbard, and where the Democratic Party needs to go on foreign policy.

*  Ben have you seen the reports that someone is calling around impersonating Marco Rubio? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3.64s)]
*  Yeah, I did. I saw that today. I was gonna flag it for you. Then I [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=8.6s)]
*  Figured you saw it. I love it [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=12.92s)]
*  I guess they contacted three foreign ministers a governor and a member of Congress by sending [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=14.780000000000001s)]
*  AI generated voice and text messages and I was just wondering how do you think you train an AI? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=20.8s)]
*  To sound like Marco Rubio. Do you just feed it like hour after hour of like cuck videos and stuff like that? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=26.96s)]
*  And why Marco Rubio right of all the people it's just kind of funny and perfect that it's him [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=33.08s)]
*  That's the guy that got nabbed by some, you know some [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=38.16s)]
*  Anonymous hacker type guy with some pretty rudimentary AI [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=42.24s)]

*  But it is funny that there was a signal account with the display name Marco dot Rubio at state got [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  I don't know. I'm guessing that's not his email address [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=57.32s)]
*  It's just somebody with a good sense of humor that they chose Rubio that that's what I appreciate is it someone out there [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=60.0s)]
*  It's like, you know what I could do any one of these guys. Let's let's take Rubio is the biggest lightweight among them [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=64.9s)]
*  Yeah, let's have a good time. Yeah, like Hegseth is almost too believable, you know, you just assume [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=69.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's signaling you [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=73.76s)]
*  Anyway, we got a great show for you guys today. We're gonna talk about is really Prime Minister BB Net and Yahoo visiting Washington [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=75.88s)]
*  again [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=82.64s)]
*  We'll talk about all this hope and sort of pre trip signaling that Trump was gonna push him for a ceasefire in Gaza [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=83.72s)]
*  With some interesting new polling about how Democrats view support for Israel or support for the Palestinians [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  We're also going to talk about Trump's headspinning policy change when it comes to providing weapons to Ukraine [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=96.22s)]
*  The latest kind of naive idiotic commentary from him about Putin and then we'll talk about the latest news on tariffs [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=100.8s)]
*  We were supposed to have a bunch of big trade deals done by today [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=107.84s)]
*  We'll update you on whether that happened and what plan B and C looks like we're also gonna do some Iran updates [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  Including Tucker Carlson's interview with the president of Iran will explain why there's a growing border crisis in Afghanistan [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=117.08s)]

*  Who comes next to the reincarnation? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=126.16s)]
*  We'll update you on some just crazy stuff happening in Thai politics [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=128.28s)]
*  And then the latest awful US immigration policy news and then Ben you did our interview today [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=132.5s)]
*  Yeah, I checked it Jason Crow [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=137.64s)]
*  Who is [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=139.79999999999998s)]
*  on the Armed Services Committee [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=141.72s)]
*  He's a congressman from Denver [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=144.27999999999997s)]
*  Veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan and just one of the better guys up-and-coming Democrats [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=147.55999999999997s)]
*  He's actually in charge of recruiting candidates with D triple C. So we talked about [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=152.35999999999999s)]
*  Iran intelligence we talked about what Pete Hegseth is doing to the military [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=155.6s)]
*  We talked about what worries him in the big beautiful bill [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=160.39999999999998s)]
*  He was pretty chilling actually on the the ice funding among other things and we talked, you know, really interesting about [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=163.16s)]
*  Where the Democratic Party needs to go on the issues that world those care about [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=169.16s)]
*  It's a pretty wide open slate and and let's just say Jason Crow agrees that wherever we go. It's not going back [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=175.04s)]
*  So we definitely agree on that so it should check it out. We covered a lot of ground. We're not going back [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=181.8s)]
*  That's a that's a slogan from the past, you know, I really like Jason Crow. I think he's a good guy a principal guy [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=186.6s)]
*  It's an important conversation and then I [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=192.24s)]
*  Didn't realize until like a couple days after the big beautiful piece of shit bill passed that [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=194.95999999999998s)]
*  When fully funded ice will now be a larger force than like the Israeli military and a bunch of militaries in Western Europe [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=201.68s)]
*  So that is pretty unnerving. Yeah. Yeah it is and Crow was pretty chilling about it [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=209.04s)]
*  Because it's also like with purpose right? I mean they're building a network of [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=215.04s)]
*  Concentration camps across the country right and they have basically more money than they could possibly spend and as you know [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=220.52s)]
*  Particularly when militarization is involved if you lot the money that tends to get spent so yeah very worrying [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=229.16000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, when you're a hammer every problem looks like a nail when you're a military everyone looks like the war on terror [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  It's not good. All right. Well, let's start with our first story, which is Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu's visit to Washington again [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=242.12s)]
*  This is his third visit since Trump took office [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=248.4s)]
*  Netanyahu arrived at the White House with his lips firmly puckered. Here's a quick clip [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=252.04s)]
*  From his little press avail with Trump before their dinner Monday night. I want to present to you [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=258.4s)]
*  The letter I sent to the Nobel Prize Committee [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=264.96s)]
*  It's moment in view for the Peace Prize, which is well deserved and you should get it [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=268.72s)]
*  Thank you very much this I didn't know [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=274.64s)]
*  Well [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=277.64s)]
*  Thank you very much [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=279.4s)]
*  Coming from you in particular. This is very meaningful. Yeah, I'm sure that Nobel Committee is [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=281.28s)]
*  Very they're swayed by an indicted war criminal. So anyway, Netanyahu is also visiting Capitol Hill on Tuesday [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=287.28s)]
*  He's gonna be back at the White House again Tuesday night for more Gaza talk on the hill [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=292.8s)]
*  He's meeting with Senate Majority Leader John Thune [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=298.52s)]
*  Chuck Schumer a bipartisan group of US senators who all apparently just don't care that Netanyahu has been indicted [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=301.08s)]
*  By the International Criminal Court for war crimes in advance of Netanyahu's visit [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=306.21999999999997s)]
*  The Trump team was spinning to reporters about how tough he was gonna be on Netanyahu [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=310.9s)]
*  I was gonna push him on a Gaza ceasefire deal. Nothing is materialized as of this recording. It's to 13 p.m [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=315.5s)]
*  Pacific on Tuesday [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=323.06s)]
*  It seems like if there is no deal it will be for familiar reasons [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=324.58s)]
*  Hamas wants to permanently end the war while Netanyahu just wants a temporary ceasefire and hostage release deal [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=328.38s)]
*  And it's just hard to square that circle. Um [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=334.46s)]
*  Also, Ben, I mean at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=337.38s)]
*  You had Steve Witkoff saying they're in proximity talks that they've resolved all but one issue is that he expects maybe some news by [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=340.38s)]
*  The end of the week. I don't know. We'll see meanwhile though in Israel [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=346.53999999999996s)]
*  Israel Katz the Israeli defense minister announced that he has ordered the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=349.82s)]
*  IDF to prepare for the construction of what he called a humanitarian city on the ruins of the city of Rafa in Gaza [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=353.34s)]
*  So Katz's plan is to move [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=361.14s)]
*  600,000 Palestinians into the area and then prevent them from leaving [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=364.18s)]
*  This is phase one [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=368.58s)]
*  And then I guess phase two is to eventually force all two million Palestinians into this tiny area of the Gaza Strip [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=369.42s)]
*  Before implementing a forced emigration plan. So in other words a full ethnic cleansing of the Gaza Strip, which is a crime against humanity [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=375.38s)]
*  Then it feels like the it really felt like going into this visit the Trump administration was kind of trying to cook up yet another narrative [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=383.38s)]
*  That the Israelis have agreed to a peace deal and the only impediment is that Hamas won't take it [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=390.38s)]
*  Therefore they're at fault for the war continuing that kind of blame game is a tougher sell when the defense minister is [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=395.14s)]
*  Simultaneously pitching a plan to ethnically cleanse the Gaza Strip [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=403.17999999999995s)]
*  But I don't know do you have any hope of some kind of peace deal coming or ceasefire lease coming out of this trip? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=406.82s)]
*  I mean very little I mean this depressing thing about this Tommy is that [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=411.54s)]
*  Gee, we've seen this play before Joe Biden ran it a bunch of times [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=416.94s)]
*  Yep, Joe Biden used to love to say that the Israelis had agreed to a ceasefire when they hadn't I mean they just had they're the ones [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=419.86s)]
*  continuing the war [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=426.94s)]
*  and and look [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=428.66s)]
*  the idea that [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=430.66s)]
*  They need to continue the war for what purpose you know? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=433.22s)]
*  For what purpose you know Hamas is not posing some threat to Israel right now [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=437.46s)]
*  They're just not like if you if you if you're convincing yourself of that still at this point. They're not like fighting back [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=442.17999999999995s)]
*  There's not like a necessity to cut off assistance, and there's certainly not a necessity for this kind of [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=449.38s)]
*  Clear in the open planning for ethnic cleansing so if the idea is that [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=456.78s)]
*  We want to just have a ceasefire get the hostages back and then resume [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=462.90000000000003s)]
*  the ethnic cleansing and the bombing and the killing and the war crimes [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=467.42s)]
*  That's not agreeing to a ceasefire. That's just not what that is you know and [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=472.14000000000004s)]
*  They they did the same thing Biden did to kind of message this you know visit [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=476.70000000000005s)]
*  through [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=481.86s)]
*  But there's no nothing there now. I hope that they get a ceasefire. I hope that there's some [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=482.94s)]
*  You know lull in the fighting. I hope the hostages are returned [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=487.66s)]
*  But there's just so much cynicism piled on top of cynicism here [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=490.62s)]
*  And then meanwhile they're just telling us out loud that they're they're literally gonna build camps in Gaza for these people [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=494.06s)]
*  And then move them someplace else that is the definition of ethnic cleansing so I don't know [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=500.62s)]
*  I will say on the Nobel Peace Prize. I don't know if BB listen to our last [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=506.9s)]
*  Podcast Tommy I don't know if that you know guess I'm not maybe the Intel guys [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=511.58s)]
*  I don't know if you like slid into the comments [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=515.46s)]
*  But I mean it is there's just something so [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=518.46s)]
*  cynical about [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=524.18s)]
*  Kind of essentially trolling any morality right when when Trump says this means something coming from you [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=525.9s)]
*  He's talking to an indicted war criminal [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=531.86s)]
*  Who has been responsible for the deaths and maiming of tens of thousands of children in Gaza and you know [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=534.1s)]
*  Whatever you think of the Israeli [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=540.9s)]
*  Strategy they've launched wars in you know more countries than I could count now in the Middle East and and so [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=543.86s)]
*  Down is up. You know black is white truth is lies [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=550.74s)]
*  I mean that's all you can take away from this facade and actually and we'll talk about the Democratic Party [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=554.6999999999999s)]
*  The fact that this kind of gets treated normally and you know [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=560.6999999999999s)]
*  There's bipartisan people meeting with Netanyahu and and even the kind of a lot of the tone of the media coverage is it's like a [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=563.98s)]
*  Here's the Israeli prime minister coming to meet to consult on Middle East issues and just kind of no [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=570.5s)]
*  Basis for evaluating how extreme what's happening is you know I think that's gonna make people [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=577.18s)]
*  Cynical on the left and the right for that matter. I totally agree man. What we'll get into that in a second. I mean, yeah [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=582.94s)]
*  One interesting note just on this ethnic cleansing plan. I mean this would have been [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=589.3s)]
*  unthinkable to say out loud two or three years ago even if people like you know [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=594.02s)]
*  Ben Kabir wanted to ethnically cleanse the Gaza Strip, but I was listening to this Haaretz [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=597.9s)]
*  Reporter talk about how when Trump first kind of outlined this ethnic cleansing plan like kind of like Gaza becoming a resort town [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=603.0600000000001s)]
*  It really did just open the floodgates of Israel and allow the political space for every minister in the Likud Party or to the right [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=610.3000000000001s)]
*  of Likud to adopt this position to Ben is also just remarkable to me like the volume of coverage about [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=617.46s)]
*  Anti Israel comments and made at the glass and Barry music festival last week as compared to the amount of coverage of [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=624.98s)]
*  Israel cats [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=633.26s)]
*  Outlining a plan the defense minister outlining a plan to ethnically cleanse of Gaza Strip [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=634.82s)]
*  It's just it's it's glaring and shocking and I think speaks to some of this how broken the conversation is around this stuff [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=639.9s)]
*  No, we're still talking about you know [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=645.86s)]
*  Bob villain like two weeks after the fact or whatever it was and it's the same thing by the way that happened with [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=647.94s)]
*  protests at Columbia like it was convenient for people to talk about this [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=654.0600000000001s)]
*  But if you what is more important in the world today? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=657.78s)]
*  What Israel's doing in Gaza or like what Bob villain somebody that nobody had heard of? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=660.46s)]
*  That's a pretty small circle people said it in kind of the second stage at Glastonbury. I mean [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=666.0600000000001s)]
*  The people that want you to be focused on that [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=672.0600000000001s)]
*  I mean some of them have earnest, you know [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=675.38s)]
*  Concerns about it, but a lot of them are just people who want you to focus on that so they're not focusing on Gaza [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=678.02s)]
*  Yeah, so, you know we talked about Glastonbury last week and just sort of and what it says about the shift in support for Israel [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=682.58s)]
*  among young people in particular [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=689.14s)]
*  CNN highlighted some numbers from Quinnipiac polls that sort of put some data behind this conversation [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=691.38s)]
*  So voters were asked in a couple of surveys if they sympathize more with the Israelis or the Palestinians in [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=697.5400000000001s)]
*  2017 Democrats said they sympathize more with is with Israel by 13 points today [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=704.0600000000001s)]
*  Democrats sympathize with the Palestinians by 43 points [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=710.12s)]
*  So that's a 56 point swing the change was even greater among Democrats aged 18 to 49 [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=713.48s)]
*  They swung 71 points towards being more sympathetic with the Palestinians [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=719.28s)]
*  So this is a political sea change [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=724.04s)]
*  But like we were just saying like people in Washington have not come caught up with it like establishment Democrats have not caught up with it [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=726.0s)]
*  That's why you end up with someone like Andrew Cuomo [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=734.56s)]
*  Running this hard like pro-israel campaign against Zoran Mondani and really like actually probably motivating his voters [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=737.4s)]
*  More than he helped himself [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=744.6s)]
*  Yeah [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=746.6s)]
*  And it's deeply unhealthy for democratic leaders to be this out of touch with their own constituents their own voters [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=747.1s)]
*  The people they need to mobilize and appeal to on on a pretty fundamentally important issue [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=753.24s)]
*  It's just not it's not healthy the same [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=758.28s)]
*  Let's just say it too is true of kind of a lot of the people that work in foreign policy national security [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=760.76s)]
*  They don't look at actual public opinion [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=764.92s)]
*  They're constantly still looking to like very small numbers of people who are kind of the arbiters of opinion on these matters, right? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=767.8399999999999s)]
*  That nobody else listens to if Democrats care about young voters if Democrats care about seeming authentic [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=775.0799999999999s)]
*  This is a way to turn those people off. This is the way to make them cynical [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=782.1999999999999s)]
*  This is a way and it's not just about Israel [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=786.7199999999999s)]
*  you can't just get a pass on this because and this is what drove me nuts about that the reaction to kind of the [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=788.68s)]
*  Uncommitted movement, right? It was like [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=794.8399999999999s)]
*  Inconvenience, you know, why are these people inconvenient us by caring about what's happening in Gaza? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=798.04s)]
*  They're not gonna believe you on health care and other things if they think you're full of shit on this [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=803.0799999999999s)]
*  And and that's what I think people have to realize that there's a cost of this and the last thing I say is it [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=807.64s)]
*  If you think you can continue to take money from a pack, you know, whether you're Hakeem Jeffries or Chuck Schumer whomever [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=813.6999999999999s)]
*  APAC is part of the constellation of forces that have delivered this country into the hands of Donald Trump and Steve Miller and [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=820.76s)]
*  and you cannot give them a carve out and and I we need to have this fight as a party because [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=827.08s)]
*  These are the wrong people to have under your tent [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=832.36s)]
*  I'm usually a big tent person but the kind of people that are supporting BB Netanyahu and Donald Trump [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=835.14s)]
*  I don't want them like, you know [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=840.4399999999999s)]
*  My leaders of my political party like cozying up to those people [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=843.48s)]
*  Yeah, and in a pack spent the last few cycles basically funneling money to upfront organizations that primary progressive Democrats [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=847.1600000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's it's really [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=853.76s)]
*  Infuriating and then so we're talking about this like sea change and public opinion on the left. There's something very interesting [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=855.48s)]
*  Happening on the right as well [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=862.44s)]
*  Like I don't know how closely you're tracking this [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=864.08s)]
*  MAGA revolts over Trump's DOJ saying Epstein didn't judge Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=866.1600000000001s)]
*  But I've been consuming a lot of right-wing media about it and in all these conversations [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=871.5600000000001s)]
*  It's just like it's taken as an article of faith that Jeffrey Epstein was a massage agent or maybe a CIA agent [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=877.5s)]
*  But probably massage probably both and some of these guys are even saying that like the release of this DOJ memo saying [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=882.88s)]
*  Epstein didn't have a client list was timed for Netanyahu's visit. And so like look I raised this [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=890.84s)]
*  I've been consuming this stuff because it's fun to watch like cash Patel [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=896.8000000000001s)]
*  And Dan Bongino get crushed by the MAGA right for [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=900.8s)]
*  Coming out and saying actually Jeffrey Epstein did kill himself [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=906.56s)]
*  No [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=909.56s)]
*  There is not a client list when those are the guys who are like fanning the flames of this conspiracy for years and years and years [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=910.04s)]
*  But there's a serious point here too when it comes to [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=914.9599999999999s)]
*  US support for Israel because like this Epstein stuff is just another data point that is driving [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=919.04s)]
*  Negative views of Israel on the far right in this case, it's like weird and kind of specious and unfair maybe but it dovetails with the [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=926.6s)]
*  conversation around the war with Iran [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=934.44s)]
*  And I just think it's like it's gonna have a political impact and none of it bodes [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=936.9200000000001s)]
*  Well for strong US Israel ties over the long term. Yeah again if you are, you know someone who's you know [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=941.6800000000001s)]
*  More supportive of Israel than than than we are [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=949.9200000000001s)]
*  On certain things what I would say to you is if you [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=953.8399999999999s)]
*  Criminalize and that's actually what's happening, right? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=959.0s)]
*  Kind of just criticism of the Israeli government, right? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=961.8s)]
*  If you just try to banish it from the mainstream because in some cases literally by statute you say, you know [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=964.3199999999999s)]
*  It's against the law to boycott [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=971.54s)]
*  You know Israel or you know or at least we were gonna shame people who criticize Israel [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=974.0799999999999s)]
*  Zoran Mamdami is like not you know, we're gonna [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=981.16s)]
*  Denaturalize him because of his views on Israel those kinds of things [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=984.92s)]
*  You're going to drive the the criticism of Israel to the darker spaces [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=988.9599999999999s)]
*  If you cannot have an honest and open discussion of things like Gaza in [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=995.4399999999999s)]
*  mainstream spaces [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1001.04s)]
*  It's going to migrate to conspiracy theory spaces to the darker sides of the right in the left [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1002.4399999999999s)]
*  That that's what's happening, you know [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1009.4s)]
*  so one [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1011.4399999999999s)]
*  One reason to have healthy criticism as part of how you discuss these issues is to prevent [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1013.12s)]
*  The pushing into the fringes like this [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1019.76s)]
*  Yeah, and look just to tell myself a little bit more because I'm a weirdo and a sicko [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1022.12s)]
*  I watched the other night like a two hour. You're an enthusiast dude. You're not ready for how fucked up [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1026.3799999999999s)]
*  This is I watched a two-hour debate [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1031.86s)]
*  hosted by Alex Jones on Infowars [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1034.24s)]
*  Between Dinesh D'Souza and Nick Fuentes Nick Fuentes for those who don't know is this [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1037.3200000000002s)]
*  26 year old young guy like straight-up anti-semite neo-nazi [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1042.88s)]
*  Like really really bad scary dude, but my takeaway from watching this first of all is incredibly [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1047.68s)]
*  Like it was it was not an ugly debate [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1054.92s)]
*  It was very history focused and substantive and like they treated each other respectfully [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1057.64s)]
*  Respectfully and and the fear might the scary thing I took away from it was that Nick Fuentes despite having like [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1063.28s)]
*  Vile extreme views can be really compelling and convincing sounding and I think when someone like seems like they know their history [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1070.52s)]
*  What seems like they're rational and reasonable suddenly? It's a lot easier for them to launder like [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1079.16s)]
*  deeply anti-semetic fucked up views kind of like into the mainstream and I think that like when people like Charlie Kirk and other kind of [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1085.36s)]
*  More they're not like mainstream Republicans or mainstream MAGA [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1092.46s)]
*  Type influencers type like kind of look out at the landscape at the competition. It is that [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1096.1s)]
*  Fringe far right that is the problem. It is not the kind of you know, normie Dems who are left over in Washington [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1101.86s)]
*  you know that well like it's funny I I had a thought that going to Nick Fuentes and [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1109.62s)]
*  Alex Jones and Dinesh D'Souza is like kind of skipping from the marijuana to the heroin [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1116.5s)]
*  But then to like actually send the metaphor because it actually works [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1122.78s)]
*  If you make the marijuana illegal [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1127.58s)]
*  Equally to the heroin then you make people think well like if I criticize Israel, you know, I'm already out of bounds [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1130.74s)]
*  So I'm gonna go all the way over here, you know [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1138.1399999999999s)]
*  And that's what I mean by like creating a you have to create a space [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1141.1s)]
*  Where you can like have an actual open discussion or else people are gonna be like well, you know [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1144.54s)]
*  Wait a second like I I'm not finding this here. Maybe I can find it there, you know [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1150.18s)]
*  And and then that's when you get into conspiracy theory and ethno-nationalism kind of views and and that's when shit gets real dangerous [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1154.46s)]
*  And the guys who are having this debate like Jones and the two [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1160.7s)]
*  Panelists were saying explicitly what you were saying, which was this this debate would be kind of banned anywhere else [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1164.5400000000002s)]
*  Which is why we're having it here, which is why I bet they did big numbers. But anyway, I'm bogging us down [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1169.38s)]
*  I'm sorry with my my freakish [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1173.42s)]
*  Content consumption so Ben last week we talked about this this [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1176.26s)]
*  Pentagon sort of surprise announcement that weapons shipments to Ukraine including air defense missiles and precision munitions [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1181.8200000000002s)]
*  We're on pause and there's a lot of weirdness around it [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1188.18s)]
*  Like the State Department was reportedly caught off guard by it and not informed [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1190.66s)]
*  The move seemed to contradict statements that Trump had made like just days before at the NATO summit [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1194.22s)]
*  Here's one example from the NATO press conference that I think stuck out to a lot of people [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1199.1000000000001s)]
*  It was a back-and-forth with a Ukrainian reporter. Where are you from? I'm from Ukraine [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1203.26s)]
*  Oh, so my question to you is whether or not the US is ready to sell [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1207.86s)]
*  anti-air missile [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1214.62s)]
*  Systems patriot to Ukraine. We know that Russia has been pounding Ukraine really heavily right now [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1216.74s)]
*  You living yourself now in you my husband is there Wow, and I can see you very you know [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1222.74s)]
*  Amazing and me with the kids I mean was so actually because he wanted me to be your husband a soldier now [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1228.8s)]
*  He's he's there now. Yeah. Well, that's rough stuff, right? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1236.0s)]
*  That's tough. So let me just tell you they do want to have the anti missile missiles. Okay as they call them [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1240.8s)]
*  the Patriots and [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1248.04s)]
*  We're gonna see if we can make some available, you know, they're very hard to get we need them too [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1250.44s)]
*  we were supplying them to Israel and [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1254.96s)]
*  They're very effective a hundred percent effective hard to believe how effective and they do want that more than any other thing as you probably know [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1257.64s)]
*  That's a very good question. And I wish you a lot of luck. I mean I can see it's [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1264.72s)]
*  very upsetting to you, so [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1269.28s)]
*  Say hello to your husband. Okay, so it's like kind of like the closest Trump seemed to ever get to empathetic there [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1272.76s)]
*  But um, so Ben after this announcement happened, you know [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1277.88s)]
*  Politico initially pointed the finger and as did a lot of people on Twitter at the undersecretary defense for policy this guy Eldridge Colby [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1280.48s)]
*  Said he was responsible for the decision [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1287.0s)]
*  They reported that he was concerned that our weapons stockpiles were running dangerously low and which is something I've actually heard from other defense experts [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1288.88s)]
*  But NBC said the move was actually a unilateral step by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1296.14s)]
*  Even though a report by the Joint Staff on weapons numbers found that some stockpiles of these high precision munitions [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1301.92s)]
*  Were at lower levels than we want but we're not at like critical minimums yet [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1309.0s)]
*  Apparently though, this is like the third time Pete Hegseth has ordered weapons shipments to be paused only for those [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1313.5600000000002s)]
*  Decisions to be almost immediately reversed by Trump. So something weird's going on on Monday, though [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1319.96s)]
*  Trump said we'd be sending more weapons to Ukraine saying they have to be able to fend themselves [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1325.24s)]
*  They're getting hit very hard this change of heart followed a call Trump had on Friday was Zelensky [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1330.72s)]
*  Where Zelensky said afterwards it was the best conversation he's had with Trump that it was maximally productive [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1336.1200000000001s)]
*  And then I guess Trump had spoken to Putin the day before got nowhere and said publicly that he didn't make any progress of Putin [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1342.44s)]
*  so [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1349.32s)]
*  And by the way a couple hours after that conversation Russia launched its largest aerial assaults [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1350.48s)]
*  I think ever on Ukraine because on July 4th, so [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1356.12s)]
*  For those who keep score of these things Trump is currently down on Putin [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1359.84s)]
*  Here is what he had to say about Putin on Tuesday [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1363.28s)]
*  We get a lot of bullshit thrown at us by Putin for you want to know the truth [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1366.08s)]
*  It's very nice all the time, but it turns out to be [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1370.28s)]
*  meaningless [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1374.12s)]
*  Who could have predicted that except for? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1375.12s)]
*  Yeah, don't what a great judge of character [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1377.12s)]
*  Yeah, so Ben I've been talking to some defense geeks for a long time who are genuinely like sincerely concerned about the US stockpiles of [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1379.36s)]
*  Interceptor missiles in particular most mostly for the Patriot system because between US weapons shipments for Ukraine [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1387.7199999999998s)]
*  Support for Israel against Iranian ballistic missiles and drones and then US intercepts of missiles fired by the Houthi rebels in Yemen [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1394.6s)]
*  We are burning a lot of these suckers and we just like don't have the capacity to replace them that quickly [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1402.08s)]
*  So there was some honest concern the Houthis are ramping up by the way [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1407.6s)]
*  But I think they sank a ship on Sunday and they killed two sailors in a separate attack on Monday [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1411.78s)]
*  So that threat's still out there [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1416.12s)]
*  But I'm just wondering what did you make of how this all went down? [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1417.28s)]
*  Like is this really heigstath freelancing did Trump just decided he cared at some point like it's just it's so [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1420.6399999999999s)]
*  Incoherent and I can't wrap my head around it. Well, I think look first of all [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1427.48s)]
*  I'm glad that these shipments are resuming and particularly for things like the Patriots and the aircraft, you know [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1431.16s)]
*  That saves lives and that's the only thing that they have otherwise [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1436.04s)]
*  They're kind of defenseless against these Russian bombardments this people should know this is not like some big new shipment [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1439.04s)]
*  This is just kind of continuing the pipeline of stuff that was already allotted for Ukraine [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1444.54s)]
*  And yeah, maybe some of this was his you know peak at Zalansky some of this was being concerned about [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1448.8799999999999s)]
*  The drawdown because we have shoveled so many things out the door to Israel or had to use in the Middle East [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1454.24s)]
*  The two things that sent it to me [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1458.8s)]
*  The first is we've talked a lot on this podcast about how weird it is that they have no National Security Council, right? [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1460.72s)]
*  Marco Rubio is currently the Secretary of State and the National Security Advisor [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1466.24s)]
*  The NSC has been downsized dramatically the people that would normally coordinate the different agencies of the government seems like wonky stuff [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1469.36s)]
*  This is what we mean. There's no process here. There's nobody running a process [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1477.1200000000001s)]
*  It's like one guy decides to like pause stuff another guy decides to resume it [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1481.5s)]
*  Like you get a sense that there's a handful of people with power [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1486.76s)]
*  but you know Eldridge Colby and and then you know, there's Pete Hegseth and then there's you know, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1490.64s)]
*  somebody that's sitting at the White House and [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1495.5600000000002s)]
*  And there's not people sitting around a table working this through a process to make decisions [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1497.5600000000002s)]
*  And this is what that looks and feels like and we'll get to it on tariffs too because that feels the same way [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1502.48s)]
*  It's all episodic. It's all ad hoc. It's all short-term. It's all tactical [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1507.36s)]
*  It's all about like how do we feel today about things? How are we gonna get through next week? [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1511.76s)]
*  That's not a way to make a strategy [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1515.2s)]
*  Whatever you think about Putin he has a fucking strategy that he's been implementing [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1517.44s)]
*  For years, right and you're not gonna combat that week by week and that leads me the thing about Trump. I [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1522.16s)]
*  Mean it's flabbergasting that he can just it's obvious Putin lies to you [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1527.76s)]
*  Like Donald Trump's the last person on earth who realizes that a lot of what comes out of Vladimir Putin's mouth is bullshit [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1533.8799999999999s)]
*  That's been clear to everybody and I don't do this that much [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1539.1999999999998s)]
*  but if any other US president had spent five months after saying you'd end this thing in a [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1543.32s)]
*  24 hours [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1548.7199999999998s)]
*  Just wasting everybody's time, right? [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1550.04s)]
*  Like think of all the you know things that failed here, right the the ceasefire the the the one month ceasefire the three-day ceasefire [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1552.68s)]
*  The the negotiations in Istanbul. What what what did we get from that? [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1560.2s)]
*  Other than the US apparently making a bunch of concessions to Russia for nothing in return [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1564.6000000000001s)]
*  And now we're right back where we started and the thing is just resuming weapons shipments [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1568.72s)]
*  Doesn't really matter if the Ukrainians don't know what they can count on six months from now one year from now at the negotiating [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1572.92s)]
*  table, so yeah, this is like a [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1579.5600000000002s)]
*  You know half step in the right direction, but this is not like, you know inspiring a lot of confidence [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1581.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I hope it [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1587.24s)]
*  Represents a bit of a sincere and broader change in terms of Trump's views on the matter and like that [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1589.28s)]
*  He's not just primarily angry at Ukraine [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1595.32s)]
*  I do worry that this is going to be kind of like another log on the fire [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1597.72s)]
*  That's burning and kind of the right-wing mago world of all the things they're mad about right because they've decided that [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1602.1399999999999s)]
*  Ukraine is evil and that our this was gonna lead to World War three in part because Trump told us all these things [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1608.68s)]
*  I told them that yeah. Yeah, so who knows like I it is a no-brainer to give [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1614.32s)]
*  Defensive weapons to Ukraine you you read these like I was reading a firsthand report from a journalist the other day [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1620.3600000000001s)]
*  Kind of like how for a while in Ukraine people from [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1626.64s)]
*  Eastern Ukraine would come to Kiev because it was just so much safer because of missile defense systems and now [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1631.1200000000001s)]
*  People are getting killed far more regularly. They just have far less layered defense people are you know? [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1637.92s)]
*  High-rise buildings are getting hit all the time innocent people are dying [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1643.3600000000001s)]
*  There was a poet who wrote this famous poem about how you know [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1646.32s)]
*  It just sort of like felt like they all circled up when the missiles were fired and the you know [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1650.1200000000001s)]
*  It was only luck that saved you and then that person was killed in a strike that hit a cafe [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1654.92s)]
*  I think so it's just that it's a tragic awful situation. Hopefully Trump is fucking wising up here [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1659.24s)]
*  But I don't know you just can't tell them and just like you know [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1663.96s)]
*  It's like we were taking about on Gaza. It's kind of been normalized right over here [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1666.8400000000001s)]

*  The Trump administration set to settle the global trade war that they started [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1900.22s)]
*  Trump has now of course [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1904.98s)]
*  Delayed his own deadline again to August 1st [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1907.98s)]

*  But those are mostly just kind of like sort of political agreements the devil's in the details and the details are not done [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1918.1599999999999s)]
*  But it gets way more complicated from there. So Trump threatened new tariffs [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1924.1599999999999s)]
*  on Monday [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1929.28s)]
*  Basically these the old tariff rates on 14 countries on truth social Trump released these letters [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1931.2s)]
*  He had written to each country that were clearly thrown together at the last minute. For example the letter to Bosnia and Herzegovina [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1937.6599999999999s)]
*  Misgendered the president not sure that was a proofread [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1944.5s)]
*  well at a cabinet meeting Tuesday [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1947.78s)]
*  Trump also said he was going to impose a 50% tariff on copper and then a 200% tariff on [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1949.58s)]
*  Pharmaceuticals, but those might not go into a place for 18 months, which is again confusing [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1954.9399999999998s)]
*  Trump also picked a fight with the BRICS countries [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1959.6999999999998s)]
*  It's a Brazil Russia India China South Africa as well as the UAE Egypt Iran and Ethiopia [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1962.28s)]
*  He posted a truth social message that said any country quote aligning themselves with the anti-american policies of BRICS and quote [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1968.52s)]
*  We'll get additional 10% tariff with no exception. So it was just a mess [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1975.12s)]
*  Here's Trump kind of ranting about these BRICS countries earlier today at this cabinet meeting [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1979.6s)]
*  because BRICS was set up to hurt us BRICS was set up to [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1983.6399999999999s)]
*  Degenerate our dollar and take our dollar as the standard take it off as the standard [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1988.36s)]
*  And that's okay if they want to play that game, but I can play that game too [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1993.4799999999998s)]
*  So anybody that's in BRICS is getting a 10% charge [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=1997.32s)]
*  I thought BRICS was you know, I said this about a year ago and it largely broke up [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2000.0s)]
*  But you know, there are a couple that hang around but I thought it largely broke up BRICS is not [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2006.76s)]
*  My opinion not a serious there. But what they're trying to do is destroy the dollar [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2011.9599999999998s)]
*  Like he talks about like a band that broke up [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2015.92s)]
*  I think I think he's mostly mad that they're like currently having a meeting and they're like disagreeing with us bombing around like whatever [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2018.92s)]
*  So look guys if this segment has you confused join the fucking club [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2025.3200000000002s)]
*  None of this makes sense. The best example of why this process makes sense [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2028.88s)]
*  No sense and is so stupid is South Korea [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2032.2s)]
*  The US signed a free trade agreement with South Korea in 2012 and Trump just put out a letter that he says he's gonna slap [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2034.4s)]
*  Them with a 25% tariff like make it make sense [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2039.92s)]
*  So Ben sports fans may have heard of red panda, do you know red pandas? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, right [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2042.3999999999999s)]
*  She's a Chinese American acrobat. She rides on an eight foot tall unicycle [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2048.2s)]
*  She like juggles these bowls and flips them up with her feet and catches them on her head pretty badass [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2051.96s)]
*  Trump's trade policy right now to me is like red panda style like [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2057.64s)]
*  It's cool. It could work for a minute. It's distracting for a minute, but red panda recently fell and broke her wrist [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2062.68s)]
*  Yes, and so I think that's what's gonna happen to Trump here eventually that is my metaphor [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2069.2799999999997s)]
*  There's so much just bullshit or here too. I mean I do think with the bricks too [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2073.7999999999997s)]
*  first of all, you know Trump likes to sound like smart about stuff like [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2080.4399999999996s)]
*  But you can almost always tell that like one person got to him was like hey these bricks countries [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2086.24s)]
*  You know what? That's about that's about a bunch of countries all and led by China that don't want us to have the dollar be [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2091.6s)]
*  The reserve currency anymore, which by the way is something that anybody who's ever like paid any attention to a bricks meeting [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2097.0s)]
*  Has known for like a decade and he comes out and says it like he's you know dropping some like penetrating insight, right? [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2102.24s)]
*  He brought what about his buddy Modi right? [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2108.4s)]
*  Like isn't he best friend like what do you what does he think the fucking eye is in bricks, right? [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2110.96s)]
*  It's India like like you're your good friend Narendra Modi, you know [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2115.16s)]
*  So I don't I probably couldn't even name the countries in the acronym an acronym [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2119.32s)]
*  By the way was coined by a golden-sax analyst, right? So hardly started like in the way that Trump said [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2123.2s)]
*  This tariff stuff is the only thing that Trump cares about is that he has the power in the [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2129.64s)]
*  Capability to turn the dial up and down. Yeah, he loves the attention [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2137.16s)]
*  He loves the corruption potential part of what happened in that Vietnam scenario [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2140.7s)]
*  Is that lo and behold a 1.5 billion dollar golf course was approved? [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2145.04s)]
*  During an Eric Trump visit to Vietnam right after the suspension of tariffs he loves being the center of attention [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2149.36s)]
*  He loves, you know, the bricks are having a meeting in Brazil [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2155.32s)]
*  So he's gonna you know grab the the you know [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2157.86s)]
*  The camera and put it on himself like a lot of this is just about that is about like I control this [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2160.76s)]
*  I can make this pain go up go down and I think what people have to realize is a lot of these countries [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2165.92s)]
*  Almost I think too much, you know including in Europe. They kind of kiss his ass a little bit like, you know to try to [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2171.8s)]
*  Avoid the tariffs. Oh, yeah [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2177.56s)]
*  But what they're gonna be doing behind his back is all kinds of planning to D dollar [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2179.06s)]
*  What Trump is doing far more than anything the bricks have ever done [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2184.6800000000003s)]
*  Trump is putting the dollar as a reserve currency risk because who the hell wants their entire economy [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2188.6800000000003s)]

*  tariffs on every country in the world like he's far more disruptive to the US [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2200.64s)]
*  Leadership of the global economy then like a bricks meeting is yeah him and the Republican Party's policy [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2205.4s)]

*  By the way, the only way you're gonna finance a debt is to hope that the bricks countries continue to buy our treasuries [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2216.4s)]
*  Yep, and and the Japanese continue to buy our treasuries [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2221.7200000000003s)]
*  He's threatening 25 percent tariffs in Japan that recently said for the first time like hey [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2224.84s)]
*  We might have to go away from the dollar here. If you want to look for a reality check, I mean [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2229.2400000000002s)]
*  You can nerd out here a little bit [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2233.88s)]
*  But watch the bond markets right because the stock market continues to like snort whatever white powder is making them think that this is all [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2235.56s)]
*  Okay, the bond markets are not the dollar is down more than it has been in a very long time [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2243.12s)]
*  Ten percent or something massively down because people are like I don't want to put my stuff in and by the way [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2248.32s)]
*  If the bill comes due, I think what Trump is just hoping is it that the bottom falls out after he's gone? [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2254.2s)]
*  But at the rate he's going like, you know, it may not be the next Democratic president it may happen, you know sooner than that [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2260.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's a is not a good setup. But yeah, so I think the bricks [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2266.28s)]
*  Meeting they they criticized US policy on Iran. So that brings us to some Iran updates Ben [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2271.28s)]
*  So over the weekend you and I both were reading these I guess the Times in the Post Washington Post [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2276.06s)]
*  Dug into something we had talked about on the show [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2281.96s)]
*  The last couple episodes which was this surprising bizarre Israeli strike [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2284.68s)]
*  On even prison in in Iran. This prison is this new notorious [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2290.08s)]
*  hellhole torture chamber [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2295.2799999999997s)]
*  Where Iran often houses political prisoners? So the Israeli Defense Ministry said the goal of the strike [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2297.84s)]
*  Even prison was to target government repression bodies in the heart of Tehran [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2304.68s)]
*  But these you know the reporters who dug into the impact found it did the opposite [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2309.0s)]
*  The Times found that the strike on the prison angered Iranians including dissidents and that the attack killed or wounded quote [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2313.9199999999996s)]
*  Visiting family members of prisoners social workers a lawyer [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2320.3199999999997s)]
*  Physicians and nurses a five-year-old child teenage soldiers guarding the doors as part of mandatory military service [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2323.52s)]
*  Administrative staff in residents of the area again. I think the strike happened at like noon [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2329.8399999999997s)]
*  So it's during visiting hours the death toll stands at 79. That is almost certainly an undercount [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2334.08s)]
*  but it seems like a pretty catastrophic mistake if the idea was to [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2338.8s)]
*  Foment regime change or turn people against the regime in other news Ben [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2344.2s)]
*  Tucker Carlson who's been a vocal opponent of war with Iran spoke with Iran's president Masoud Pesachian [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2348.7599999999998s)]
*  In an episode of his podcast that was released on Monday [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2355.12s)]
*  The it like it was about 30 minutes long. It you know, there wasn't a ton of groundbreaking stuff [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2358.24s)]
*  I thought this was probably the most interesting revelation to come out of it. Let's listen to a clip [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2363.36s)]
*  Do you believe the Israeli government tried to assassinate you? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2367.44s)]
*  They did try yes and [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2373.1200000000003s)]
*  They acted accordingly [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2376.7200000000003s)]
*  But they failed so I take everything he says with a bit of a grain of salt [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2379.2000000000003s)]
*  But it wouldn't surprise me at all if there was an attempt to decapitate the leadership of Iran [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2383.6s)]
*  Even though that's long been seen as [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2388.7200000000003s)]
*  taboo in [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2390.76s)]
*  War but Ben, I mean I think like my biggest reaction to this whole thing was how annoying it was to have people [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2392.0s)]
*  Attacking Tucker Carlson just for conducting the interview like I'm not a Tucker Carlson fan [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2399.28s)]
*  But like the idea that we can't interview people we disagree with is so annoying like you and I [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2404.28s)]
*  you and I watched an [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2409.88s)]
*  Excerpted and made fun of Tucker's interview with Vladimir Putin because the substance of it was bad [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2412.2s)]
*  but like the I like I will defend to the death his [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2417.4s)]
*  Ability to interview interview people we find odious just as we would like defend the the right for diplomats [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2421.28s)]
*  To talk to countries that we disagree with otherwise like how are we ever gonna learn? [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2428.48s)]
*  Like a bridge our disagreements or learn more about them. It's just such a fucking stupid stupid argument. It drives me crazy [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2433.4s)]
*  Yeah, no, and and look I mean [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2439.84s)]
*  It's not the first person that's interviewed an Iranian foreign minister. I mean, I remember, you know [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2442.44s)]
*  Both Rahani the president and Zareed the foreign minister did multiple interviews with like major US media outlets [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2449.26s)]
*  Yes, Obama years and we weren't upset by it [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2454.7400000000002s)]
*  Because it was actually it was helpful and I helpful to see what their message was like, you know [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2457.2200000000003s)]
*  Like it's actually you learned, you know, even if you don't like them you kind of learn like oh what are they serving up? [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2462.0200000000004s)]
*  Like what's their message right? Like you kind of learn what their strategy is, you know [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2467.3s)]
*  so I look I do think that [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2471.1400000000003s)]
*  It connects the even prison thing though because [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2474.78s)]
*  There's this kind of weird sheen on how that this war is being presented like we just bombed these nuclear sites [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2478.86s)]
*  We the lot many people were killed, you know more far more by Israel and it's bombing and even prison thing [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2486.46s)]
*  You know Neelu to breezy who's on this show a couple weeks ago did [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2493.5800000000004s)]
*  Participate in that Washington Post investigation. The Times runs great, too. People should check it out [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2497.5s)]
*  Why would you bomb the place where the dissidents are [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2502.54s)]
*  It's not like a prison break bomb. It's not like you're precision blowing up a wall so they can escape [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2507.14s)]
*  They're like they're literally bombing. Yeah. Yeah, these are big bombs. They're literally bombing the the so what it what it tells me is it [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2511.8199999999997s)]
*  There's always been this kind of faux bullshit like we stand with the Iranian people [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2519.7s)]
*  like MO from the hardliners in Israel in the United States and it used to drive me nuts with those people come after a [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2525.2599999999998s)]
*  People like us, you know because you don't care about the Iranian people you you want to use their suffering to justify [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2531.66s)]
*  What you want to do in militarily against the Iranian government? That's really like let's that is what's happening here [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2539.98s)]
*  Why does BB Nenya when he gives speeches to the Iranian people? [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2545.8599999999997s)]
*  He gives them in English. She doesn't give them in you know, Farsi right like or even in Hebrew, right? [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2550.54s)]
*  it's for Americans and [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2557.42s)]
*  In you know Western journalists so they can say see look we actually stand with these people [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2560.02s)]
*  That's not what's happening here [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2565.46s)]
*  even if you support even if you hate the regime this only [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2566.9s)]
*  Strengthens the regime's position and by the way gives them like a pretext to crack down more and more on people and again the [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2571.38s)]
*  To come back to the Tucker thing. It's the absence of an ability to kind of speak openly about this like [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2579.02s)]
*  Is been is very? [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2585.14s)]
*  Leads to bad outcomes and this is one of them where it's like, you know [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2587.7799999999997s)]
*  I would have been a much bigger story a few years ago if you bombed Avon prison and killed potentially [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2591.98s)]
*  At least dozens if not hundreds of people there [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2598.5s)]
*  And now it's this kind of side note to you know debating whether or not, you know [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2601.7s)]
*  How much Trump obliterated like a couple sites? [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2606.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I just the the debate like the platforming debate is so stupid [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2610.1s)]
*  It drives me crazy and like there's everything to the plant every day, you know, every like everything is debated about that [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2614.34s)]
*  Yeah, and it's just like it is censorious. It is anti free speech [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2620.82s)]
*  I regret that the Democratic Party has embraced it at times and it's like why why is like ICC indicted BB Net and Yahoo? [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2624.3s)]
*  Allowed to go on five Sunday shows a week, but like what you can't interview the president of Iran once why not? [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2630.7000000000003s)]
*  It's newsworthy. It's interesting. Maybe he'll say something that provides an opening for diplomacy and finding middle ground often [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2636.38s)]
*  Those sorts of signals are sent in public remarks because they're hoping they'll be picked up when there isn't a diplomatic relationship [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2643.6600000000003s)]
*  So the shit just drives me fucking crazy [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2649.82s)]
*  All right, but so one, you know, the the war in Iran is also exacerbating this border crisis with Afghanistan [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2651.82s)]
*  So the Iranian government says that there's about six million Afghans who live in Iran about four million or undocumented [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2658.5s)]
*  The New York Times reported that since March over eight hundred thousand Afghans have returned home to Afghanistan [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2664.7000000000003s)]
*  This came after Iran announced that all migrants and refugees had to leave Iran by July 6th [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2671.7s)]
*  But on top of that Afghans were getting increasingly blamed for economic and social problems in Iran and then there was this conflict [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2677.7s)]
*  So meanwhile as we discussed on the show before Pakistan has been conducting its own campaign [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2683.82s)]
*  To expel the three and a half million Afghans living there [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2689.18s)]
*  That's leading to thousands of families crossing basically every single day into Afghanistan like one day last week [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2693.7799999999997s)]
*  I think there were thirty thousand people who passed through in the day and all of this has led to people arriving who are [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2699.9s)]
*  Exhausted hungry. They have no money. They have nowhere to go and they're they're landing in border towns [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2706.02s)]
*  They're not even close to equipped to handle that many people and then plus I mean we shouldn't probably don't have to say this [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2710.94s)]
*  But Afghanistan is having its own humanitarian crisis. There were decades of war then there was the US [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2716.7400000000002s)]
*  Canceling aid for Afghanistan. There's ongoing sanctions by the West and the US in particular [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2722.6200000000003s)]
*  And the UN warns that this many returnees could destabilize Afghanistan in the region and again like you know [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2727.9s)]
*  While life is could be awful for women for example in Iran life under the Taliban is going to be even worse [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2734.26s)]
*  Especially for women who are forced to travel alone because the Taliban will not let them move freely or work [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2741.14s)]
*  So it's just like another example of a truly awful [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2746.9s)]
*  Man-made crisis that is getting next to no attention [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2751.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and like the two things that add to that one is it it shows you how much all these different things connect, right? [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2754.46s)]
*  I mean you you have like bombing in Iran [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2761.38s)]
*  You're gonna you know drive people back in Afghanistan like you've got a complete mess and dysfunction in Pakistan same thing [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2764.6200000000003s)]
*  But the other thing that really worries me and I mentioned this to Jason Crowe because he served in Afghanistan cares a lot about this [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2771.78s)]
*  We are about to be deporting a bunch of Afghans. Yes, who are in this country [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2777.94s)]
*  Right including people that work with the US military including people who are women's rights advocates including people that work with USAID [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2784.3s)]
*  You know people who didn't kind of get fully naturalized or get their status fully in order [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2791.6600000000003s)]
*  But you know a lot of those people that a lot of people to help to get out in that chaotic [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2796.86s)]
*  Evacuation they're kind of here and they're ripe [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2801.0200000000004s)]
*  You know they're the kind of people that that have been targeted by ice and I cannot think of anything more chilling than [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2803.42s)]
*  Someone that worked with the United States for all those years or believe the things we told them about values and [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2810.94s)]
*  Came to the United States and came here [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2818.0200000000004s)]
*  Expecting that they were going to be resettled and now being risked at being put on a flight to God knows where you have not back [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2820.94s)]
*  To Afghanistan, you know South Sudan or somewhere, right? Yeah [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2827.7400000000002s)]
*  So it's just another reason to keep some attention on trying to protect at least that [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2830.5400000000004s)]
*  Population of Afghans are here because right now things are so bad in Afghanistan is just like whatever individual you can help [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2835.58s)]
*  That's that's one less person who's kind of dealing with this absolute nightmare [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2843.34s)]
*  All right. Yeah, we're gonna talk about some more terrible immigration news in a minute Ben, but let's bounce around a bit first [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2848.2200000000003s)]
*  On Sunday thousands of people braved monsoon like rain and turned out to celebrate the Dalai Lama's 90th birthday in [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2852.82s)]
*  Daramshala India, but as a rager the that's the location of the Tibetan government in exile [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2860.34s)]
*  So in a video the aforementioned spiritual leader of the Tibetan Buddhism [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2866.02s)]
*  Announced that the centuries-old tradition of his form being reincarnated after his death will continue [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2870.58s)]
*  That is very important to the Dalai Lama's followers because the Chinese Communist Party claims [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2875.7s)]
*  They alone have the authority to approve the next Dalai Lama [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2880.54s)]
*  But this time the Dalai Lama says the identity of his successor will come with preconditions [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2883.62s)]
*  Including the child must be born in the free world and the office of the Dalai Lama will have quote sole authority to recognize the future [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2888.74s)]
*  reincarnation so we don't have time to go through all the history here the long history of [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2896.1s)]
*  China and Tibet sort of conflict but a bit of recent history just for context [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2900.98s)]
*  So the Dalai Lama fled China in 1959 after the Chinese military brutally crushed a Tibetan uprising [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2905.22s)]
*  He's lived in exile in India ever since the Chinese government views the Dalai Lama as an enemy [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2911.62s)]
*  He's called the Dalai Lama a separatist a wolf and monks groves [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2916.46s)]
*  He's they've instituted this regime of just far-reaching [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2919.82s)]
*  repression and indoctrination of people in Tibet and the question of reincarnation and succession for the Dalai Lama is [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2923.34s)]
*  especially important when you understand the history because [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2930.06s)]
*  1995 after the Dalai Lama identified a six-year-old boy as the chosen [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2933.46s)]
*  reincarnation of the Panchen Lama who was seen as the second holiest figure in Tibetan Buddhism the Chinese government [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2938.5s)]
*  Disappeared the child and his family and installed their own pick and so this six-year-old kid and his family literally haven't been seen since so Ben [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2944.22s)]
*  You know that the US and I think you know Western countries generally now have so many issues [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2951.74s)]
*  With China that Tibet has really like kind of fallen [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2957.98s)]
*  Way off like the front page, but I wonder if you think that'll change if Beijing [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2961.86s)]
*  tries to appoint the Dalai Lama successor and then like bully the world into [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2966.66s)]
*  Following along with it because there still is like I think like Richard gear was at this Dalai Lama's birthday party [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2971.62s)]
*  There is some like, you know lingering [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2976.62s)]
*  Memory of how important this issue was for many many years. I mean the sad truth is probably not [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2979.66s)]
*  You know that and look anybody that's kind of so frustrated with the US right now [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2986.14s)]
*  That they're tempted to kind of you know start being sentimental about the Chinese Communist Party [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2991.7s)]
*  Should just look at Tibet where essentially not only has there been this erasure of the Dalai Lama, but they've really you know [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=2997.38s)]
*  repopulated parts of Tibet [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3004.86s)]
*  Tried to eradicate the use of Tibetan language culture and you know literally trying to [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3006.86s)]
*  Some Chinese Party functionary is gonna pick the next Dalai Lama like I mean how cynical do you get here? [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3013.2599999999998s)]
*  I do think and something kind of sad about it cuz you know [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3019.58s)]
*  I met the Dalai Lama a couple times and like, you know [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3022.82s)]
*  Let's just say there's not many people you're in a room with where you're like, oh that guy's [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3026.02s)]
*  Guy lives up to the billing right? [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3030.02s)]
*  truly spiritual the holy good person [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3032.5400000000004s)]
*  The him in in his later years in this kind of isolation [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3036.02s)]
*  Is kind of a sad commentary and how far we've come from like, you know [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3040.5400000000004s)]
*  He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 89 when things were looking like history was moving in one direction [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3044.6600000000003s)]
*  I should have got it down. Yeah, you know [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3048.78s)]
*  Now what I will say is that I I think that if the Chinese mess with the success which I probably will I [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3050.86s)]
*  Think it'll rekindle [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3056.7799999999997s)]
*  First of all, they'll probably be a reaction in Tibet [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3058.98s)]
*  And the Chinese will be nervous about that and they'll you know, probably crush it [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3062.06s)]
*  But we've seen this before like and tragically sometimes involves like self emulations, too [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3066.54s)]
*  but I I also think that [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3072.42s)]
*  You know the Dalai Lama clearly chose to do this. He didn't need to do this [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3075.38s)]
*  And I think he sees it as an effort to kind of keep this flame alive [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3079.62s)]
*  And I do think enough people will care that there will continue to be this movement of a Tibetan exile community [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3082.98s)]
*  Tibetan exile spiritual community and yes that spiritual community has made inroads into cultures around the world, too [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3089.62s)]
*  So I the hopeful point I would make is that you're not going to extinguish this, you know [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3096.2s)]
*  The flame will pass to somebody else. It's just maybe a while before [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3101.9s)]
*  China's changed enough that that flame can get any traction inside of inside of China really tells you everything [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3107.98s)]
*  You know about that government that they took a six-year-old boy as a political prisoner and just disappeared him for 30 years [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3113.46s)]
*  And they bully they bully you the hell out of governments to not meet with I mean you remember it's like they really [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3119.62s)]
*  You know, they'll use all their muscle to if you meet with the Dalai Lama suddenly you're you're cut off from China for years [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3125.7s)]
*  Yeah penalized for years, yeah, yeah creepy about it [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3132.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, all right switching gears a little bit [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3135.14s)]
*  So crazy shit has been happening in Thailand and our incredible producer Michael will probably quit if we do not tell you about it [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3137.18s)]
*  So buckle up. No, I'm kidding. This is actually a [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3143.94s)]
*  Legitimately really crazy story. So just to set the stage a bit here. So Thailand and Cambodia [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3146.38s)]
*  They share a 500 mile land border, which has been disputed since 1907 [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3150.98s)]
*  Thanks to French colonial boundaries drawn by the French again. Thank you [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3155.94s)]
*  Colonizers, um, so fast forward to late May [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3160.74s)]
*  Thai and Cambodian troops shot at each other in a disputed area of the border and a Cambodian soldier was killed [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3164.3399999999997s)]
*  Both sides blame the other since then there has been this escalating tit-for-tat between the two countries [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3170.7799999999997s)]
*  Cambodia has banned produce media and fuel from Thailand Thailand has blocked tourists from entering Cambodia [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3176.66s)]
*  That was a particularly big blow to Cambodia's [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3182.66s)]
*  Lucrative casino industry which Ben I think you and I spent some time in [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3186.56s)]
*  together back in the day on an Obama trip and it was a weird spot and [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3190.68s)]
*  Then both sides have shut down some like lane crossings, but so that's obviously bad [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3195.16s)]
*  But the story heats up when Thai Prime Minister [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3199.0s)]
*  Peytung Tharn Shinawatra had this ill-fated and unfortunate phone call with former Cambodian leader Hun Sen in an attempt to ease [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3202.64s)]
*  Tensions so we talked about Shinawatra last year when she took office. She's part of this Thai political dynasty [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3210.6s)]
*  I think her dad and aunt also served as prime minister. She is very young. She's 38. She's the daughter of a billionaire [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3216.4s)]
*  She is not remotely qualified. She's a degree in hotel management [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3223.44s)]
*  so in this 17 minute call [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3227.68s)]
*  the the Cambodian side recorded it and then they leaked it and [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3230.6s)]
*  In the call she called Hun Sen uncle [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3235.2s)]
*  He was like an old buddy of her dad's and she talked about how quote the other side in other words the time [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3237.92s)]
*  Military commander who has been handling the border dispute quote just wanted to look cool and said things that are not useful [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3243.5200000000004s)]
*  And when this leaked it really really pissed off like everybody it pissed off her coalition it pissed off the Thai public [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3250.5200000000004s)]
*  They did not take kindly to her deferential tone the disparagement of her own military and [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3257.1200000000003s)]
*  Despite like a lot of groveling there was a public apology that she was trying to spin it and say look I'm just being [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3263.4s)]
*  Conciliatory to the Cambodian side as kind of a negotiating tactic. She is now in a full political crisis [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3270.7599999999998s)]
*  The second largest party in her governing coalition pulled out leaving them with a tiny majority [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3277.16s)]
*  Then last week she was suspended from her job by the Constitutional Court pending an ethics investigation [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3282.48s)]
*  And the government is already on I think it's second caretaker Prime Minister, so it's a total mess [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3288.44s)]
*  One of the big questions here Ben is whether Thailand is vulnerable to yet another military coup [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3293.68s)]
*  There have been at least 12 since 1932 and it runs in the family [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3298.36s)]
*  I mean her father was removed from office by a coup in 2006 [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3302.88s)]
*  I think a coup followed her aunt's removal from office by the Constitutional Court in 2014 [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3306.2s)]
*  So all of which is to say Thai politics never boring never boring [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3311.52s)]
*  Like there's layers of this that are really interesting. So [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3317.0s)]
*  Let's start on the Thai side because yeah Thaksin her father [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3320.44s)]
*  You know really rich guy, but a populist rich guy he gets asked about the military [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3325.8s)]
*  Ying luck who is his sister the aunt? [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3331.2000000000003s)]
*  We went to Thailand and you know [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3335.36s)]
*  Barack Obama met her, you know [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3338.28s)]
*  During press conference things like seemed like things are going great and then the military put her on a plane to London [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3340.6400000000003s)]
*  I think you know like two years later, right? [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3346.28s)]
*  So the military coups can happen with regularity and there was this kind of strange deal [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3348.92s)]
*  Remember between the Thai military and the kind of Thaksin dynasty to kind of let him return let her [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3353.6800000000003s)]
*  Take power, but it was always kind of tenuous and part of what was creepy about the deal [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3361.0800000000004s)]
*  Is that they completely sidelined the one hopeful progressive younger political party in Thai politics? [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3366.08s)]
*  So though if you if you're wondering who the good guys are the good guys are the people that kind of got muscled out of the picture [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3372.88s)]
*  No, no one mentioned before this is a good guy. Yes [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3378.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and and so like nobody's that sympathetic to the military here, even though, you know, she handled this poorly [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3382.3199999999997s)]
*  It's people always also forget Thailand is a treaty ally the United States [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3387.68s)]
*  Now I don't think it was expecting we're gonna come to their defense on the Cambodian border dispute dispute [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3392.16s)]
*  But the problem here is it you know, you just don't the military to be I mean part of what she was probably [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3397.4s)]
*  Indicating is that maybe the military is ginning this up because you know, they want to kind of re assert their you know [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3403.24s)]
*  position at the vanguard of nationalism, I will say also Hun Sen [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3409.44s)]
*  Really creepy bad dude like not a good guy like like this history goes all the way back to Khmer Rouge [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3414.84s)]
*  He's crossed the opposition not a lot of good actors in this [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3420.88s)]
*  What you would like to do though is actually calm down [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3424.6800000000003s)]
*  You don't want like a border dispute in that part of the world [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3427.28s)]
*  You don't want violence in that part of the world and you would hope that there's some process to maintain a civilian government in Thailand [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3429.48s)]
*  But yeah [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3436.1600000000003s)]
*  This this has the rumblings of a situation that will probably not lead to better outcomes in either Thai or Cambodian politics [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3436.84s)]
*  Yeah, and also watch what you say on an open line never good. Yeah. Yeah, well that [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3444.0800000000004s)]
*  Everybody should be learning that lesson. I mean Marco Rubio. Yeah, what watch who's gonna sliding into your signal? [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3449.7999999999997s)]
*  Final story Ben, so let's just end on some immigration news before we get to your interview [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3456.52s)]
*  So on Monday the Department of Homeland Security terminated yet another temporary protected status designation this time for Hondurans and Nicaraguans [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3459.8399999999997s)]
*  This comes on the heels of the administration's efforts to get rid of TPS for migrants from Venezuela, Haiti, Afghanistan [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3467.7999999999997s)]
*  Cameroon Nepal [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3475.2s)]
*  So there's a US District judge blocked the DHS termination for Haiti last week [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3476.64s)]
*  So we'll see how long that lasts though given that the Supreme Court has rolled in Trump's favor over and over again on immigration [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3482.72s)]
*  For example allowing the administration to end TPS for Venezuelans in May and letting them deport eight men to South Sudan [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3488.4399999999996s)]
*  Just last week as you mentioned earlier only one of whom is from there [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3495.06s)]
*  So lots of terrible stuff happening on this front, but the people impacted by this [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3498.72s)]
*  The rescinding the designation for Honduras and [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3504.04s)]
*  Nicaragua so it's estimated to be about 72,000 Hondurans and 4,000 Nicaraguans [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3507.6s)]
*  They will now have 60 days to comply with the termination luckily about I think 21,000 Hondurans and 1,100 Nicaraguans have green cards [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3512.44s)]
*  So hopefully they won't be affected [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3519.92s)]
*  But and then there's also some of them are being encouraged to use like this self deportation app [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3521.3199999999997s)]
*  Which gets you a free plane ticket and like a thousand dollars cash if you leave [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3526.2799999999997s)]
*  But then just like stepping back if you believe the State Department [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3529.86s)]
*  They have a travel notice up that says Nicaragua and Honduras are not safe places to visit because of crime limited health care [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3533.62s)]
*  sliding Democratic norms corruption and repression and then the most recent Human Rights Watch World Report for Nicaragua says that [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3540.82s)]
*  President Ortega and his wife are seeking to consolidate power [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3548.66s)]
*  Overhaul the government and have quote expanded the use of forced exile and citizenship revocation as a way to target critics [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3551.58s)]
*  But we're still gonna send all these people back to their home countries anyway [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3557.62s)]
*  And in addition to those like political and safety considerations that make this just a gross shitty thing to do [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3561.06s)]
*  the decision just is unbelievably cruel given the history because [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3568.9s)]
*  TPS was granted to Honduran in Nicaraguans in 1999 [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3572.9s)]
*  After Hurricane Mitch tore through Central America [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3577.9s)]
*  It killed over 11,000 people and was just devastating [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3581.22s)]
*  I think seven thousand people died in Honduras a million were displaced so just decimated these countries and so, you know, I think [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3585.22s)]
*  The critics of TPS would say the T and TPS stands for temporary and sure that's fair [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3592.7s)]
*  but like what we're talking about doing here in practice is [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3598.5s)]
*  Expelling people from the country who have lived in the United States for over 20 years. They have jobs. They have families [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3602.2599999999998s)]
*  They're part of communities [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3608.62s)]
*  There's a guy, you know who had worked in construction around New Orleans for two decades who told a Fox affiliate [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3610.8199999999997s)]
*  Basically if I lose my TPS I lose my dream of becoming commercial pilot like kids [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3616.2999999999997s)]
*  You can't get hired if you aren't in good legal status [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3621.66s)]
*  So we're just like we're we're we're creating these nightmare scenarios for all these people who are in the country [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3623.9399999999996s)]
*  Legally trying to do the right thing responsible parts of communities [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3630.54s)]
*  Like I don't think but the Republicans like whenever some horrible immigration thing [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3633.8999999999996s)]
*  Happens will be tweet like I did vote for this like I don't think anyone voted for [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3637.66s)]
*  You know a Honduran whose home was destroyed in 1998 to be sent home in 2025 like it's just like [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3643.54s)]
*  Completely unnecessarily cruel. Yeah, I mean one thing about the Trump administration yet [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3651.78s)]
*  There's that I think it's that quote attributed to Stalin, right? [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3657.42s)]
*  You know one death is a tragedy and you know, whatever however many million is a statistic [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3661.66s)]
*  Like Trump wants to numb you with this the scale of this think of how many? [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3666.9s)]
*  Absolute human tragedies are unfolding before eyes [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3672.26s)]
*  Yeah [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3674.6200000000003s)]
*  Like people who've been here for decades who are good members of the community who give back to the community [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3675.1000000000004s)]
*  Not only are they gonna be subject to the kind of terror being returned to places that they don't know [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3680.7000000000003s)]
*  Where they're losing their dreams where they could be subject to violence or have no means of making living [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3685.7000000000003s)]
*  But think of all the people that they'll be separated from maybe family members or maybe just people in their community the ripple effects [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3690.7000000000003s)]
*  of this the other thing that bears saying is yeah hurricane Mitch may have been the proximate cause of TPS, but [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3696.82s)]
*  American fingerprints are all over how messed up Central America is you know [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3703.6200000000003s)]
*  I mean these are the places where the United States was backing death squads, right? [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3707.94s)]
*  These are the places where we were meddling in politics [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3712.9s)]
*  And so that bears in mind to this didn't just happen out of nowhere like you know [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3715.7000000000003s)]
*  And frankly a lot of the best immigrant communities the United States come from these places [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3721.46s)]
*  You know like El Salvador like Vietnam. You know where frankly you know we had a complicated history [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3726.02s)]
*  But the only positive that came out of it is [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3733.1s)]
*  Like people made something of themselves in this country and just to try to wipe that away [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3735.78s)]
*  It to me is like a real tragic loss for this country even if it's a big you know win for for Stephen Miller [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3741.7400000000002s)]
*  you know and so I mean we really just need do need to keep the [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3748.1s)]
*  Attention on this because this is not normal and the only political point I make and you know hesitate to make it, but [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3752.46s)]
*  Some of these communities you know [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3759.5s)]
*  Like because I've seen I deal with this on Cuba right the Cuban Americans supported Trump and and and now [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3762.5800000000004s)]
*  Like there's a Cuban American that died in an ice facility and they're deporting people back to Cuba [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3768.5s)]
*  Same thing with Nicaragua where a lot of people didn't like Daniel Ortega well now [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3773.26s)]
*  They're sending people back to Daniel Ortega a lot of Venezuelans [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3777.0600000000004s)]
*  The the Republican Party has been selling you a fiction that they cared about the Venezuelan people the Nicaraguan people or the Cuban people [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3780.7400000000002s)]
*  They didn't they use it as a wedge political issue in places like Florida to call Democrats a week or to call Democrats [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3788.26s)]
*  Communist what they're doing now tells you everything that they actually believe about those people. Yeah, it's cruel. It's stupid [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3794.2200000000003s)]
*  It's unnecessary. I think it's gonna hurt our economy [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3801.0600000000004s)]
*  It's politically unpopular a pew had a poll last month that found [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3803.5200000000004s)]
*  59% of voters oppose ending TPS for immigrants who fled war natural disasters [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3807.5s)]
*  That's exactly what we're talking about like you don't find very many issues that pull at like 59 60 percent [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3811.54s)]
*  I mean, that's like overwhelmingly unpopular. So Stephen Miller Rogan and John Fabro agree about it. Yeah [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3816.7s)]
*  Right, Stephen Miller might like, you know, it's sitting is like sad little cuck chair at night and like get off to this stuff [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3821.22s)]
*  But this is the second cuck comment. I mean, I'm really out of control [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3826.96s)]
*  But no one else wants this to happen and it's just it's wrong and we should talk about it [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3829.2999999999997s)]
*  We should not be scared if I talk about this. No, we should not be scared to talk about this [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3833.2599999999998s)]
*  Because it's both the right thing morally and politically you've hit this point just end on the lighter note [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3836.5s)]
*  Because we need a levity here. Stephen Miller is 39 years old [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3841.3799999999997s)]
*  And he looks he looks literally like the Empire the Emperor from star [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3845.3399999999997s)]

*  Who's just being eaten alive from the inside? I know like it's it's better to not be cruel, you know [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3853.4599999999996s)]
*  Yeah for your health. Look, I know I got some bags under my eyes [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3859.1s)]
*  After I crossed the 40 Mendoza line and with two kids, but boy when I read that he was 39 years old [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3862.46s)]
*  I could [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3868.54s)]
*  Look a 59 year old man and you know the [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=3870.7000000000003s)]

*  Thanks for having me. I know this is great. Well, we'll have to you know, make this a regular appointment [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4049.06s)]
*  So I there's a lot to cover. I want to start with the you know bill that just passed. I hate to [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4055.42s)]
*  It feels weird to be a grown-up and call it the big beautiful bill [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4062.58s)]
*  Or even call it one of the pejorative [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4066.54s)]
*  I know I [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4070.86s)]
*  Piece of garbage it just passed but you know so much focus rightly so on [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4072.2599999999998s)]
*  You know the inequality on the Medicaid cuts on the the harm it's gonna do to Americans. I think you know [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4076.62s)]
*  Probably less front of mind for people though [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4083.86s)]
*  Is it there's a bunch of dimensions where this is potentially dangerous for our foreign policy in our global competitiveness? [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4085.7s)]
*  I mean I could run the gamut from our long-term fiscal health to our ability to compete with China [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4093.82s)]
*  to the strange fixation on missile defense [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4100.34s)]
*  I just want to start by asking you to frame for people [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4103.9800000000005s)]
*  You know kind of a national security or foreign policy or your competitiveness argument against this massive bill that just passed Congress [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4107.3s)]
*  Yeah, well, I mean the the energy [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4114.38s)]
*  production tax credit rollbacks the wind and solar tax credit rollbacks are probably one of the largest [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4118.74s)]
*  National security strategic blunders that we've seen [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4125.54s)]
*  In years if not a generation right you at no point in American history has there been a closer tie [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4128.780000000001s)]
*  to our ability to produce [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4136.38s)]
*  quick clean safe [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4139.46s)]
*  Low cost energy and our ability to have economic and military might then it right there this point in American history [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4142.740000000001s)]
*  Right you look at AI you look at the data centers you look at the the new [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4150.22s)]
*  Defense systems that are in development or that we're fielding right now [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4155.42s)]
*  Extremely energy consumptive right so that tie is is very very [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4160.3s)]
*  Close and China knows it China is doubling tripling down on this they've actually last year [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4165.3s)]
*  They produced more wind and solar [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4171.54s)]
*  Than the rest of the world combined [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4174.099999999999s)]
*  They are investing in this very heavily because they know this to be true [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4176.42s)]
*  So the rollback is gonna be really really devastating for the production of energy that we're gonna need for both economic and military might [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4180.7s)]
*  There's just no other way to put it [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4187.78s)]
*  Yeah, I'm gonna ask you a follow-up question about this because I kind of can't understand something about the Trump administration [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4189.34s)]
*  Which is on the one hand they talk a lot about you know China and competing with China [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4195.14s)]
*  But they also talk a lot about critical minerals and and the kind of supply chains that are necessary for [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4200.64s)]
*  Clean energy and and the kind of technologies of the future and yet at the same time [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4208.62s)]
*  They're doing these massive massive cuts in [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4214.78s)]
*  clean energy [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4218.0199999999995s)]
*  And in this kind of bizarre effort to kind of bring back coal right and and whether you look at that from a climate change [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4219.5s)]
*  Perspective and energy cost perspective or national security perspective. It doesn't make sense [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4225.74s)]
*  How do you square? [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4230.74s)]
*  The fact that they're talking about the supply chains for things like batteries and solar power [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4232.46s)]
*  While they're cutting the investments in it. Do you see the internal inconsistencies that I'm struggling with? [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4239.5s)]
*  Asking me to square any of the inconsistencies in this administration is a is quite a task [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4246.9800000000005s)]
*  And you know frankly impossible in a lot of respects [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4253.14s)]
*  The way the way that I make some sense of this is that there is an internal ideological battle happening within this administration [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4257.38s)]
*  Between you know what I would call defense hawks [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4265.7s)]
*  traditional, you know conservatives [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4268.86s)]
*  Which is a small and dying faction of mega world and then the isolationists [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4271.7s)]
*  Those who are more focused on the the culture war aspects of this, you know, and it's that [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4277.58s)]
*  Wing that won out on this renewable energy rollback right that wing that basically just said [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4283.94s)]
*  You know, this is this is liberal progressive energy, right renewable energy wind and solar even though I'll say even though Texas [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4290.38s)]
*  A red state and most of these large projects are actually in red states Republican governed states [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4299.06s)]
*  So senators voted for things that are gonna roll back [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4305.02s)]
*  Hundreds of billions of dollars of projects and cost tens of thousands of jobs in red states [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4307.48s)]
*  What wanted wanted these tax credits and advocated for it, but you know that mega [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4314.32s)]
*  Ideological wing which won out this battle is prevailing more and more and we're seeing this [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4320.719999999999s)]
*  I mean it is a dying faction, you know, these kind of national security hawks [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4326.5199999999995s)]
*  Of the Republican Party. There are very few of them left at this point [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4331.08s)]
*  Yeah, well actually that's a good transition to I wanted to ask you about Iran where the national security hawks [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4334.84s)]
*  Were able to at least for a couple days get Trump to obviously [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4339.92s)]
*  Bomb Iran and its nuclear facilities [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4346.799999999999s)]
*  Although then he kind of abruptly halted that bombing [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4349.88s)]
*  I want to ask you about the intelligence piece of this though to start with because you know, you sit on Armed Services [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4352.599999999999s)]
*  I'm sure you're supposed to be privy to briefings about [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4358.92s)]
*  Battle battle assessments damage assessments of the Iranian nuclear program. Obviously, this is a hugely consequential action [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4362.96s)]
*  But it all depends on how far we set back the Iranian nuclear program whether that's sustainable whether they decide to go covert and [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4371.2s)]
*  develop their own [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4379.48s)]
*  nuclear capability without anybody being able to get access to their facilities and [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4380.92s)]
*  You know Trump said it was obliterated [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4387.5599999999995s)]
*  After really clearly lying about you know, the fact that there was an imminent weaponization [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4390.4400000000005s)]
*  And he kind of forced Tulsi Gabbard his DNI to take back [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4396.4400000000005s)]
*  Their own assessment that they did not think Iran was weaponizing. The question I want to ask you is how do you trust? [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4400.360000000001s)]
*  The information that you're given as a member of Congress [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4407.360000000001s)]
*  How should we trust what is told to us publicly when it is so clear that they are essentially directing [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4410.320000000001s)]
*  Intelligence agencies to give them the information they want and there was even a story that [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4418.400000000001s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard is fired intelligence officials who won't kind of bend the facts fit their narrative and that she is hoping to get access to [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4422.320000000001s)]
*  Emails and chats of people in the IC and use AI to see who's weaponizing intelligence [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4429.280000000001s)]
*  I mean, this does not seem like people trying to get the facts, right? So how do you as a consumer of intelligence? [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4434.72s)]
*  How do you deal with that? [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4440.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'm asking myself that actually it kind of goes to the core one of the core questions of [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4441.320000000001s)]
*  How long will the professional civil service? [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4447.64s)]
*  Be able to hold out in this administration, right and whether this is the IC whether this is DOD [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4451.280000000001s)]
*  Whether this is EPA whether this is FAA you have these, you know lifetime civil servants [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4457.84s)]
*  You know spies Intel analysts air traffic controllers, you know weather forecasters you fill in the blank [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4464.320000000001s)]
*  and [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4471.4400000000005s)]
*  Of course if their intelligence doesn't meet the narrative if it doesn't match [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4473.36s)]
*  What the public narrative is for Donald Trump and mega world then they come under fire [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4478.2s)]
*  And that's of course why in May Tulsi Gabbard literally fired the acting chair of the National Intelligence Council [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4482.599999999999s)]
*  Because they came right out and they said there is no evidence that shows that that the gang trend day [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4488.839999999999s)]
*  Aragwa is controlled by the Venezuelan government [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4494.48s)]
*  Gabbard and Gabbard's chief went back to the chair of the NIC and said [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4497.88s)]
*  This does not match what we're saying what the president is saying [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4502.96s)]
*  So why don't you take another look at it and rewrite it which of course they did not do and they lost their jobs [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4506.36s)]
*  So that that is my question is how long can this how long can they hold out? [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4512.72s)]
*  I mean, we're an eighth of the way through this administration, right? And you all look at what's happened so far and [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4517.72s)]
*  And [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4524.48s)]
*  You know you fast-forward another six months another year [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4525.599999999999s)]
*  It could be a dire it could be a really dire position [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4529.2s)]
*  Where you know the information that we're getting on Capitol Hill or that you know people are getting downrange [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4532.919999999999s)]
*  In the co-coms are not getting good information. So what I'm doing is I'm looking at changes [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4539.04s)]
*  Right now I have a pretty good steady flow of [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4545.4s)]
*  Regular, you know why CIA wires we get our weekly brief, you know members of Congress [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4549.44s)]
*  That sit on the Intel Committee. We fly in every Monday. We have hot spots. We get our briefing book [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4554.36s)]
*  We read through all the briefs for all the major conflicts in the world [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4559.48s)]
*  We take deeper dives and areas of special interest, you know, I think I've taken special interest in covert action programs and a variety of other [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4563.84s)]
*  counterterrorist [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4572.08s)]
*  Things in Russia Ukraine. So we take a deep dive there. So I'm looking for changes and I'm looking for shifts and I'm looking for [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4573.719999999999s)]
*  Who changes and who is doing the briefing to and [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4581.120000000001s)]
*  Right now that seems to be holding and I hope it can hold longer [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4585.400000000001s)]
*  Because I'm worried about it and deeply worried about it. Yeah, I mean I just to play this out [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4590.6s)]
*  you know [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4595.52s)]
*  It's hard to believe that [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4597.04s)]
*  If six months from now, right the assessment is well actually the Iranians [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4600.280000000001s)]
*  You know, they they took their fuel and some of the handful of events centrifuges and they kind of went off the grid [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4604.200000000001s)]
*  with them and you know, you know [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4609.36s)]
*  It doesn't seem like you know [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4611.96s)]
*  It seems like Trump would rather have the narrative be that these strikes solve the problem obliterated the facilities [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4614.28s)]
*  Then he'd want people to give him bad news, right or give Congress hate for a new [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4620.0s)]
*  So I guess to your point you if you start to see that the kind of whether it's Iran or any other issue [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4625.16s)]
*  That the people are changing and the news is always good for Trump [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4632.48s)]
*  You know that then do you think there's a capacity to come out and kind of blow whistle and be like [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4635.92s)]
*  Hey, we see what you guys are doing here. I think so. I mean there's a there's a [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4641.2s)]
*  To the extent that the law matters for this administration, which also is a open question [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4645.8s)]
*  There are special and certain laws just for the IC that allow whistleblowers to come forth to Congress [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4651.04s)]
*  Actually, this is a whole different whistleblower system as you're well aware from your time and in the administration [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4657.8s)]
*  So protecting that system is going to be really important and maintaining [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4663.2s)]
*  Whistleblower capacity is going to be really important, but there there is a truth here, right? I mean Iran [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4667.4s)]
*  Either will or won't reconstitute its program, right? [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4673.32s)]
*  The the three facilities that hit either were obliterated or were obliterated or they weren't obliterated [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4676.16s)]
*  Yeah, and Israel has a dog in this hunt too, right and [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4681.76s)]
*  Donald Trump says that they were obliterated and doesn't want anybody else to say that [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4686.64s)]
*  They were obliterated and doesn't want anybody else to say differently and he's willing to move on [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4690.76s)]
*  You know Israel if they're not obliterated [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4696.0s)]
*  Is probably gonna speak up and take action as well. So that I see there being a potential wedge [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4698.68s)]
*  Between Donald Trump's narrative in what Israel wants to be able to do here and many other countries by the way [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4704.52s)]
*  I mean again as you know well from your time negotiating these agreements pretty much [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4711.76s)]
*  Nobody wants Iran to have a nuclear weapon right including China including Russia. Nobody really wants this to happen [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4716.38s)]
*  and and we know [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4724.82s)]
*  We have a pretty good sense for what Iran is doing and we also know that you can't bomb your way out of this [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4727.1s)]
*  Which is why you know you help negotiate that agreement because unless it's permanent and unless it's verifiable [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4733.860000000001s)]
*  We will always be doing this, right? [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4740.78s)]
*  We will always just be playing the game of whack-a-mole and bombing them every six months or year or 18 months if that's the [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4743.22s)]
*  Strategy if that's what you want to call it with this administration [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4749.58s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I want to I want to come back to that at the very end on the Democratic Party on Iran [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4752.22s)]
*  But I do want to ask you just two more things about Trump because knowing your personal expertise in history, right? So you're a veteran [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4757.46s)]
*  and [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4764.62s)]
*  When you look at Pete Hexeth and what he's doing at the Pentagon [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4766.900000000001s)]
*  How concerned are you that? [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4770.7s)]
*  The combination of the changes are making at the kind of general officer level on down [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4773.38s)]
*  the cultural [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4778.860000000001s)]
*  kind of uber-maga [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4780.58s)]
*  You know Hexeth Ian [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4782.62s)]
*  Approach to things right down Trump military parades [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4784.9800000000005s)]
*  Everything Trump says is right and the deployments to the US military right in the United States [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4788.38s)]
*  Like I'm from Los Angeles like the military is in my streets literally [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4793.26s)]
*  How worried what are you seeing? [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4797.42s)]
*  You know about and how worried are you about the [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4799.54s)]
*  The the you know people always thought that military be the last you know, the hardest nut to crack for Trump, right? [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4802.46s)]
*  It's the biggest, you know most [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4808.78s)]
*  Entrenched kind of bureaucracy that there is there's millions of people in it [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4812.02s)]
*  But are you worried that that they could be trying to remake the military and Trump or Hexeth's image and that that might open up [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4814.9800000000005s)]
*  The door to the use of the US military in the United States in ways that we've not seen before [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4821.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, well a couple of things number one the way that that Pete Hexeth [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4827.98s)]
*  operates his leadership style again if you want to call it that even in and Donald Trump is completely [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4834.34s)]
*  Antithetical to everything I learned in the military right this notion of servant leadership [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4841.06s)]
*  You know from day one of boot camp and I was a private and then when I became an officer [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4845.38s)]
*  It's drilled into you its servant leadership [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4849.82s)]
*  You know when you're a paratrooper you jump out of the plane first and then your soldiers follow [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4852.58s)]
*  You you you know eat last you go to sleep last [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4857.0199999999995s)]
*  You suffer with your soldiers [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4861.179999999999s)]
*  You know this administration and the the the you know [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4864.66s)]
*  What the message they send over and over again is the rules don't apply to me, right? [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4869.42s)]
*  They apply to everybody else, but not me whether it's signal gate whether it's [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4874.34s)]
*  kicking out trans members from the military [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4878.86s)]
*  Military [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4880.9s)]
*  Restrictions on women in service and on and on it's truly abhorrent stuff [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4882.099999999999s)]
*  and [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4888.46s)]
*  You know you look at my own combat experience. You know I went to war three times in Iraq and Afghanistan [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4889.54s)]
*  and it was that experience that [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4894.86s)]
*  Underscored for me the importance of protecting civilians and conflict zones the importance of diplomacy and humanitarian aid [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4897.98s)]
*  And all of the the tools in our toolbox as a country not just military power and frankly the inherent limitations of [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4905.54s)]
*  Military power those are the lessons that I took away, and I see what's happening now that [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4913.02s)]
*  Basically the only thing that does matter is hard power and military power [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4918.42s)]
*  It's a recipe for disaster, and it's not going to end well [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4922.02s)]
*  Yeah, and then you add on top of that you know per your previous question [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4926.14s)]
*  You know I went to war in Iraq based on politicized intelligence [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4929.780000000001s)]
*  You know we spent 20 years in the war and terror [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4933.820000000001s)]
*  And a good chunk of that in Iraq trillions of dollars thousands of US soldiers lives [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4938.42s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of other lives [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4945.34s)]
*  ruined [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4948.22s)]
*  because [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4949.58s)]
*  Politics was driving the intelligence. Yeah, well and to just kind of tie it together to one other issue [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4951.3s)]
*  I know you care a lot about [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4957.06s)]
*  Which is Afghans? [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4959.46s)]
*  Or Iraqis that that served with us who are the United States [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4961.62s)]
*  I had the kind of haunting feeling that you could have the US military deployed in support of ice raids as is the case in [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4965.06s)]
*  Los Angeles that are going to roll up [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4971.42s)]
*  Afghans who were here without permanent status and try to send them back to Afghanistan [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4974.02s)]
*  I mean is there anything that can be done to protect particularly you know [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4979.94s)]
*  People like from Afghanistan and Iraq who you know served with the US military or [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4984.7s)]
*  Supported the values that we were standing for there [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4990.54s)]
*  Well, we're I mean there are an action quite a few Republicans who are still involved in this issue [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4993.3s)]
*  We started in 2021 we started the bipartisan honoring our promises working group in Congress [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=4998.5199999999995s)]
*  There there's a number of Republicans that we continue to work with who served with [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5005.139999999999s)]
*  Afghans during the war who or whose families served with [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5009.38s)]
*  Afghans who are working with us to push back on this and try to protect them on an individual basis [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5013.46s)]
*  So there's that piece but then [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5018.139999999999s)]
*  To go back to your point about the use of military domestically obviously a big concern of mine [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5021.0599999999995s)]
*  but what keeps me more awake at night is the provisions of the the [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5027.54s)]
*  Big beautiful bill if you will with Donald Trump's disaster bill last week [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5033.58s)]
*  This is really what keeps me awake that bill [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5039.0599999999995s)]
*  Just tripled the budget of ice and in one fell swoop [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5043.339999999999s)]
*  May it gave it a budget that is now bigger than the FBI the DEA the ATF and [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5051.58s)]
*  Customs Service combined [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5059.0599999999995s)]
*  Right it made it the largest law enforcement [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5061.219999999999s)]
*  Entity in American history [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5064.82s)]
*  bigger than the US Marine Corps [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5067.42s)]
*  Right and so they're gonna hire loyalists they're gonna hire they're gonna create this this ice force [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5070.06s)]
*  Almost from scratch and it's gonna have [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5078.1s)]
*  very broad [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5081.9800000000005s)]
*  jurisdiction and authorities within the United States it's gonna be tens of thousands of new agents and it's gonna have [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5083.62s)]
*  unbelievable amounts of money including large incarceration camp in the incarceration camp system around the [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5090.9800000000005s)]
*  Around the entire country that is scary as hell [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5097.82s)]
*  Yeah [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5101.3s)]
*  That's kind of the the ultimate manifestation of the kind of darkness that we're dealing with in this period [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5102.38s)]
*  And I want to ask you one last question that I should be the beginning of a conversation Jason [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5108.3s)]
*  Which is essentially about the future the Democratic Party on these issues, right? Yeah [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5114.94s)]
*  So I noticed in the Iran debate some of the old kind of left right, you know cleavages in the party [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5119.94s)]
*  between people who were opposed to the strikes or [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5127.32s)]
*  Posing them on their unconstitutional grounds as you did [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5132.4800000000005s)]
*  Or that they're not the best way to solve the problem [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5136.52s)]
*  And then maybe people who weren't necessarily supportive, but who just were very quiet about it including some of the leadership in the party [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5138.9800000000005s)]
*  And and look to be blunt like these issues often get pretty intense obviously around Israel and Gaza or Israel and Iran [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5145.68s)]
*  I think also traditionally they've been on defense. They've been on China [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5152.16s)]
*  And it's usually framed as a left-center [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5155.96s)]
*  Difference and frankly could bring the border and refugees right some people who are who want to be more welcoming of refugees [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5158.639999999999s)]
*  Some people want to take a harder line [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5164.679999999999s)]
*  It feels like Trump is scrambling all this anyway, right? I mean in part because what he's doing is so extreme that everybody opposes [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5166.759999999999s)]
*  It like the ice [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5172.799999999999s)]
*  Money you just talked about but also because he doesn't fit naturally an ideological spectrum. So [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5174.5599999999995s)]
*  You know you're involved in leading candidate recruitment for instance for the D [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5179.799999999999s)]
*  CCC the Democratic Congressional Committee and you're you're you're someone who's navigated. I've noticed over the years [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5184.32s)]
*  You know between these different wings, you know, you don't have to be just you know [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5190.36s)]
*  Dogmatically this way progressive or centrist just trying to find things that make sense [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5195.16s)]
*  How do you frame this? How do you think about this? [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5200.32s)]
*  How do we take what is kind of a blank slate after Joe Biden? [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5202.84s)]
*  I think of what the Democratic Party stands for on foreign policy and try to both build consensus [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5206.5199999999995s)]
*  But also consensus it isn't just like hey, let's run back the tape to you know [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5212.2s)]
*  The rhetoric about American exceptionalism and and you know act like it's permanently the 90s. Yeah. Yeah [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5216.84s)]
*  Well, there's a couple of ways I think about this one is [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5222.8s)]
*  that [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5226.96s)]
*  Americans want something different and if different Democrats are not [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5228.32s)]
*  serious about that [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5233.5199999999995s)]
*  And honest about that if our solution is hey, we're just gonna fight back to Trumpism [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5235.0s)]
*  And we're gonna try to preserve institutions as they are and we're gonna build what once was [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5242.04s)]
*  That will be a fail a massive failure. We will have missed the point [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5247.6s)]
*  We will have not heard America which is telling us very resoundingly that we want a new foreign policy vision a national security vision [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5252.6s)]
*  So then it has to look different has to feel different has to deliver differently [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5259.96s)]
*  So that's a [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5265.08s)]
*  And and this is that this is Democrats [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5266.68s)]
*  opportunity to say [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5269.64s)]
*  You know, we don't want everything to be destroyed and torn down, but that is what Trump is doing [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5272.16s)]
*  So if they're gonna dismantle this system then then now we have the opportunity to build something new [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5277.76s)]
*  Right. What is the new? [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5284.96s)]
*  Progressive vision for national security and foreign policy for America that delivers for American people that communicates with them [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5287.24s)]
*  That has an ecosystem and an infrastructure that looks more like the American people rather than you know [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5294.0s)]
*  The same people over and over again making making policy in this town, right? [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5300.72s)]
*  Which are great people like a lot of them are great great friends of mine and they're really smart people [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5306.56s)]
*  But listen that the sad reality is and I'm running her all around the country doing this recruiting helping candidates [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5311.72s)]
*  campaigning doing this work and [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5319.56s)]
*  I can tell you [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5321.68s)]
*  People are pissed off [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5323.92s)]
*  They think the system has failed them. They don't want to go back [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5325.68s)]
*  And they want they want it to look and feel and be different and they want some different people [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5330.82s)]
*  Doing it too. So we have to learn that lesson and then the second piece is [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5337.5s)]
*  The two camps the camps who are the one camp that is willing to allow [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5344.379999999999s)]
*  Unbelievable presidential power right that we were in an era of the height of presidential power versus the camp that that says no [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5351.74s)]
*  Congress is gonna take it back, right? [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5358.94s)]
*  So this is a whole different way of looking at the Iran thing [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5361.0199999999995s)]
*  Right so much of the rhetoric around the Iran strike is was it an obliterated was it not obliterated was this successful? [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5363.86s)]
*  Was it not successful? Well, that lens is a might makes right lens. Yeah, it was illegal, right? [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5370.18s)]
*  Right, like I mean so much of that it was frustrated that the hell out of me because it was like [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5378.58s)]
*  Yeah, wait a minute. All we're talking about is was it successful or not because [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5382.26s)]
*  The assumption is if it was successful then it's okay [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5386.200000000001s)]
*  No, it's not shouldn't do things that aren't necessary that are illegal even if they blow some things up, you know [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5389.320000000001s)]
*  I mean, right and I've been pretty consistent about this, you know that for over 20 years now [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5394.56s)]
*  Democrat and Republican controlled Congresses and Democrat and Republican controlled [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5401.400000000001s)]
*  administrations [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5406.360000000001s)]
*  Have allowed war powers have allowed immigration authorities have allowed all sorts of things [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5407.72s)]
*  to [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5414.360000000001s)]
*  to go outside of the control of Congress as our [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5415.8s)]
*  Constitution divisions and I'm you know me and Tim Kaine and others are like no it's time to take it back, right? [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5419.400000000001s)]
*  We're not gonna allow that to happen anymore. And the reason you have 20 years. Sorry, I'm on a I'm on my soapbox here [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5426.0s)]
*  But the reason you know, it's great years [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5431.76s)]
*  Preach you get 20 years of a war that should have ended much sooner. We spend three trillion dollars [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5433.88s)]
*  Thousands of lives lost credibility lost opportunity is because we stopped having a debate we financed it with debt [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5441.0s)]
*  Congress literally took one vote the entire 20 year period and it stopped and [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5449.32s)]
*  You know, I get jazzed about it because obviously I I went and I fought in those wars and I saw people [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5455.8s)]
*  give their lives in these wars and [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5461.92s)]
*  It should have ended much sooner [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5465.04s)]
*  And [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5467.08s)]
*  If Congress were [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5469.24s)]
*  Involved in the way that our Constitution [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5471.4s)]
*  Envisions, I think it would have yeah. No and not to mention the fact that the [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5474.16s)]
*  extraordinary [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5479.76s)]
*  immigration [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5481.0s)]
*  Sanctions and other powers that were kind of accumulated in the war on terror [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5481.88s)]
*  That's what Trump is using right now people should know that for everything from tariffs to deportations [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5486.16s)]
*  It's all these extraordinary, you know declarations of national emergencies [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5491.5199999999995s)]
*  You know [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5495.4800000000005s)]
*  All these things that he's doing are kind of part of this infrastructure of presidential power [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5496.72s)]
*  So I I I want to leave it there, but you have to come back to talk more about this [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5500.8s)]
*  I think this is a great starting point though, which is one way to think about it is before we start solving [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5505.64s)]
*  What our China policy is let's just agree on [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5510.52s)]
*  Maybe we should actually have checks and balances in the Congress that brains in the out-of-control executive because frankly you'll get more progressive outcomes [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5513.160000000001s)]
*  As you say if you don't concentrate power like this, but Jason Crow I want to thank you so much [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5520.12s)]
*  It's a wide-ranging conversation. We'll have much more to get to [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5525.16s)]
*  We'll have to have you obviously back on before the midterms [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5529.36s)]
*  To talk about kind of where this is all going as a party, but thanks for your your work on this and for joining us [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96_k7rGTNE&t=5532.36s)]
