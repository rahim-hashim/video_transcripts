# Breaking Down Biden's New Trade War with China
**Pod Save the World:** [May 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE)
*  Welcome back to Pod Save the World. I'm Ben Rhodes, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=0.0s)]
*  and Tommy is out again this week. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2.1s)]
*  For those of you who are not close followers [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4.64s)]
*  on social media, you may not know that he shared [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=7.84s)]
*  that he and his wife Hannah have welcomed a new baby boy. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=10.68s)]
*  So, a growing VTour family, we're thrilled for them. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  And of course, he's taking some time off with family. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=16.98s)]
*  We do, though, have a great show for you today. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=21.12s)]
*  We've got an amazing one-two punch, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=23.52s)]
*  two amazing guests, co-hosts, and friends of mine. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=25.8s)]
*  The first is Dan Kurtz-Faelin, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=29.86s)]
*  who is the editor of Foreign Affairs Magazine, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=31.54s)]
*  and the author of a really terrific book, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  if you want to go back to the history [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=37.0s)]
*  of the United States and China, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=38.5s)]
*  kind of the origin story for how we got here today in many ways, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=40.0s)]
*  a book called The China Mission. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=43.08s)]
*  Dan will be joining us to talk about [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  the latest developments in Gaza, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=46.34s)]
*  Joe Biden's new tariffs on China, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=48.019999999999996s)]
*  China policy more broadly, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=49.980000000000004s)]
*  as well as the situation in Russia and Ukraine, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=51.58s)]
*  and protests in Georgia over a foreign agent law. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=54.019999999999996s)]
*  Then, Rana Ayyub, someone we've heard from on this podcast [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=57.86s)]
*  before, will be joining me in the second half of the show [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=60.56s)]
*  to talk about the Indian elections, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=62.86s)]
*  what another Narendra Modi term might mean [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=64.9s)]
*  for India and the world. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=67.4s)]
*  Rana is a journalist and global opinion columnist [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=68.88s)]
*  at the Washington Post. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=71.08s)]
*  So, before we get to Dan here, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=73.08s)]
*  I just wanted to bring people up to speed [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=75.82s)]
*  on where things stand in Gaza. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=77.92s)]
*  So, a few updates. First of all, according to the UN, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=80.48s)]
*  over 360,000 civilians have fled Ra'afah [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=82.92s)]
*  after last week's evacuation orders were given by Israel. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=86.53999999999999s)]
*  No food or aid has entered the Ra'afah border crossing [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=89.64s)]
*  with Egypt in over a week. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=92.61999999999999s)]
*  That's one of the most significant through lines [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=94.17999999999999s)]
*  for aid to get into Gaza. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=97.66s)]
*  And according to the World Food Program, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=99.42s)]
*  a full-blown famine is already underway [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=101.42s)]
*  in the north of Gaza, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=103.86s)]
*  and that's related to the Ra'afah crossing [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=105.3s)]
*  because the fuel that gets in for aid trucks [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=107.1s)]
*  has come across that crossing. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=109.3s)]
*  Israel's continued to carry out what they call, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=111.19999999999999s)]
*  quote, limited scope operations in Ra'afah. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=113.69999999999999s)]
*  This is a way to kind of be somewhere in between [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=115.96s)]
*  doing nothing and a full-scale invasion. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=118.89999999999999s)]
*  But reports of civilian casualties keep coming in. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=120.74s)]
*  The overall death toll in Gaza has passed 35,000. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=123.53999999999999s)]
*  Humanitarian organizations keep reiterating [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=126.64s)]
*  that there is nowhere safe to go in Gaza. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=128.82s)]
*  A UN employee was killed and another injured [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=131.18s)]
*  in a strike on a vehicle with the UN flag flying on it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=133.22s)]
*  Some reports have said that there are larger numbers [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=136.66s)]
*  of Israeli troops massing on the edge of Ra'afah [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=139.2s)]
*  that could signal a bigger military push that's coming. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=141.85999999999999s)]
*  At the same time, there's a lot of diplomacy. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=144.74s)]
*  Jake Sullivan, the National Security Advisor, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=147.88s)]
*  is planning to go to the region, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=149.62s)]
*  in part probably to forestall a full-scale Ra'afah invasion. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=151.38s)]
*  And all this is happening despite President Biden [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=155.56s)]
*  saying in an interview with CNN last week [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=158.35999999999999s)]
*  that he would cut off some offensive military assistance [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=160.6s)]
*  to Israel if a large-scale offensive in Ra'afah [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=163.4s)]
*  were to happen. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=165.84s)]
*  However, there continue to be kind of mixed messages [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=167.34s)]
*  coming out of the Biden administration. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=170.44s)]
*  Last Friday, the State Department [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=172.46s)]
*  submitted a report to Congress that found that Israel, quote, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=174.0s)]
*  potentially violated humanitarian law. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=176.94s)]
*  But that report did not formally conclude [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=179.48s)]
*  that Israel did violate humanitarian law. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=181.68s)]
*  And it said that the US did not have, quote, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=184.34s)]
*  complete information about whether or not [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=186.38s)]
*  US weapons were used in those actions. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=188.12s)]
*  So a bit of a hedge there. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=190.57999999999998s)]
*  There's also now more fighting that's happened [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=192.42s)]
*  in northern Gaza where parts of Hamas [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=194.12s)]
*  seem to have regenerated and launched [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=195.92s)]
*  some attacks of their own. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=198.26s)]
*  This has led to some of the more vocal criticism [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=199.88000000000002s)]
*  of Israel's lack of an endgame that we've heard to date [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=202.22s)]
*  from the administration. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=205.02s)]
*  Let's hear a clip from Secretary of State Tony Blinken. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=206.32000000000002s)]
*  We believe two things. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=208.5s)]
*  One, you have to have a clear, credible plan [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=209.70000000000002s)]
*  to protect civilians, which we haven't seen. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=212.70000000000002s)]
*  Second, we also need to see a plan for what [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=214.9s)]
*  happens after this conflict in Gaza is over. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=217.4s)]
*  And we still haven't seen that. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=220.74s)]
*  Because what are we seeing right now? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=222.14000000000001s)]
*  We're seeing parts of Gaza that Israel has cleared, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=224.54000000000002s)]
*  of Hamas, where Hamas is coming back, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=227.74s)]
*  including in the north, including in Khan Yunis. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=230.08s)]
*  As we look at Ra'a, they may go in [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=233.34s)]
*  and have some initial success, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=236.42s)]
*  but potentially at an incredibly high cost to civilians. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=238.42s)]
*  But one that is not durable, one that's not sustainable. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=242.78s)]
*  And they will be left holding the bag [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=245.62s)]
*  on an enduring insurgency because a lot of armed Hamas [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=247.62s)]
*  will be left no matter what they do in Ra'a. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=250.26s)]
*  Or if they leave and get out of Gaza, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=252.96s)]
*  as we believe they need to do, then you're going to have [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=255.46s)]
*  a vacuum and a vacuum that's likely to be filled by chaos, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=258.7s)]
*  by anarchy, and ultimately by Hamas again. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=261.36s)]
*  So that's a pretty searing indictment, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=263.66s)]
*  albeit in Tony's understated way, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=268.64s)]
*  of I think the gap between the Israeli military [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=270.9s)]
*  objective of destroying Hamas and US concerns [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=273.78s)]
*  that that's not an achievable objective. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=276.92s)]
*  Just a few thoughts from me before we get to Dan on this. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=280.32s)]
*  First of all, Joe Biden's comments to CNN [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=283.24s)]
*  got a lot of attention. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=285.74s)]
*  I don't think they should have come as any surprise. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=287.54s)]
*  He's warned for months now that Ra'a would be something [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=289.54s)]
*  of a red line for him. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=293.08000000000004s)]
*  And clearly the administration didn't feel [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=294.62s)]
*  like the Israelis had been able to address US concerns [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=296.28000000000003s)]
*  about the civilian cost of going into Ra'a. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=299.62s)]
*  So that was, I think, the right step. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=303.02000000000004s)]
*  Ultimately, you have to back up words with action [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=305.66s)]
*  and withholding military power. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=307.76000000000005s)]
*  You have to back up words with action [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=310.46s)]
*  and withholding military assistance [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=312.02s)]
*  is one of the biggest pieces of leverage that the US has. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=314.26s)]
*  But you still sense this kind of ambivalence [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=318.06s)]
*  around kind of following that logic all the way. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=320.56s)]
*  The administration was kind of walking back parts of it [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=323.8s)]
*  the next day. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=325.74s)]
*  They seem to kind of not want to have the rift with Netanyahu. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=326.94s)]
*  And yet the substance of the situation suggests a rift. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=330.8s)]
*  Israel seems determined to go into Ra'a in some fashion. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=335.18s)]
*  It's not surprising to me that Netanyahu's kind of trying [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=340.16s)]
*  to do this in a way in which he can say, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=342.0s)]
*  well, it's not a full scale invasion, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=344.06s)]
*  but if you seal the border crossing [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=345.36s)]
*  and you're taking airstrikes and you're doing ground incursions, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=348.04s)]
*  at some point this becomes about semantics. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=351.6s)]
*  Possibly there's still efforts to negotiate some ceasefire. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=355.18s)]
*  Jake Sullivan's going to Saudi Arabia on his trip. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=358.64s)]
*  That's also going to bring him to Israel. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=361.42s)]
*  And that suggests they're still trying [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=362.52s)]
*  to assemble this idea of a Saudi normalization [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=364.12s)]
*  as a part of an incentive for Israel [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=366.92s)]
*  to refrain from going into Ra'a. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=369.0s)]
*  But that's a long shot. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=371.15999999999997s)]
*  And we'll see, hopefully, best case scenarios, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=373.15999999999997s)]
*  you get a ceasefire. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=375.29999999999995s)]
*  If you don't, though, it's hard to see how it's sustainable [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=376.34s)]
*  to have the US and Israel in such different positions [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=381.94s)]
*  without Biden following through on his threat, really, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=384.52s)]
*  to withhold offensive military assistance. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=389.58s)]
*  And so we're kind of in this no man's land right now [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=393.35999999999996s)]
*  where there's a kind of slow motion invasion of Ra'a, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=396.06s)]
*  threats of US withholding assistance, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=399.86s)]
*  some assistance being withheld, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=401.86s)]
*  but we're kind of poised before a real break [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=404.8s)]
*  between Biden and Netanyahu on the substance of this. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=408.4s)]
*  And I will just note that the longer these border crossings, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=413.64s)]
*  particularly the Ra'a crossing, is closed, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=417.54s)]
*  the more the famine-like conditions [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=419.12s)]
*  and humanitarian crisis is going to be growing, too. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=421.46s)]
*  So unfortunately, that's the update, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=425.09999999999997s)]
*  and it's not a good one. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=429.47999999999996s)]
*  A couple of things that people might want to also check out. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=431.78s)]
*  The New York Times reviewed a trove of Hamas documents [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=435.28s)]
*  that I think effectively illustrates their brutality [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=438.28s)]
*  of their governance of Gaza over the years. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=442.12s)]
*  And CNN has an amazing story with some Israeli whistleblowers [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=444.62s)]
*  about the mistreatment of Palestinian detainees. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=447.96s)]
*  So again, a reminder that on all sides of this conflict, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=450.56s)]
*  there's extreme suffering, especially for civilians in Gaza. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=454.82s)]
*  With that, though, I want to turn to Dan Kurtz-Faelin, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=458.46000000000004s)]
*  great editor of Foreign Affairs, good friend of mine. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=462.2s)]
*  Dan, welcome to Pods of the World. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=464.90000000000003s)]
*  Thanks, Ben. Really good to be with you. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=466.76s)]
*  I've listened to the show for a long time, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=468.46000000000004s)]
*  so glad to be doing my best to channel Tommy [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=470.44s)]
*  under these circumstances. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=473.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, here you are. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=475.44s)]
*  Well, look, Dan, I want to start with this question about Gaza. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=476.94s)]
*  And really, you're somebody in your position [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=481.7s)]
*  who can take a step back and kind of look at trends [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=484.9s)]
*  and look at thinking and look at where debates are going. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=487.64s)]
*  People Should Read Foreign Affairs has had some great articles, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=490.64s)]
*  both online and in print, about the future of Gaza, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=494.38s)]
*  the future administration of Gaza, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=498.08s)]
*  the future of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict generally. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=500.58s)]
*  I think looking beyond kind of this parade of horribles [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=503.65999999999997s)]
*  in the news that I just went through, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=506.92s)]
*  what are you seeing as the key questions in this debate [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=509.68s)]
*  about what happens even after a Ra'aq invasion [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=514.78s)]
*  in terms of how is Gaza administered? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=518.0600000000001s)]
*  What do you see the contours of that debate [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=520.16s)]
*  in terms of who's in control of Gaza [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=522.66s)]
*  and how you try to minimize Hamas's authority [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=524.84s)]
*  while creating some window for peace? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=528.7s)]
*  So it's a really good question. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=531.2s)]
*  I think what you see in that answer, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=532.94s)]
*  the clip you played from Tony Blinken, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=535.04s)]
*  is in his quiet diplomatic way, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=537.0799999999999s)]
*  a lot of frustration coming to the surface, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=540.38s)]
*  and that represents really pretty deep disconnects [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=542.48s)]
*  between the US view of the course of this war [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=545.78s)]
*  and the future of Gaza that has been boiling for some time. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=550.4s)]
*  I think, you know, use the word ambivalence. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=555.3s)]
*  There's been a lot of ambivalence about really coming out [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=556.8s)]
*  and reacting to that, you know, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=559.3s)]
*  the withholding of some number of 2,000-pound bombs, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=561.4s)]
*  but without being especially clear [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=566.32s)]
*  about what future consoles would be, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=568.1800000000001s)]
*  as I think a kind of example of just how difficult this is [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=570.02s)]
*  for President Biden especially to do. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=572.92s)]
*  You know, they've been talking for months now [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=574.82s)]
*  about using US leverage to constrain Israeli action, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=576.46s)]
*  shape Israeli actions, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=580.5s)]
*  and are just finally kind of getting to it [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=581.76s)]
*  in pretty subtle ways. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=583.96s)]
*  But when you go back, I think, even to the weeks [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=586.26s)]
*  after October 7th, there was this already [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=588.74s)]
*  a pretty profound difference [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=592.24s)]
*  between the US view and the Israeli view [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=594.3199999999999s)]
*  about how you think about success in Gaza, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=597.0799999999999s)]
*  how you define success, and kind of understandably [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=599.66s)]
*  in those traumatic first weeks after the October 7th attack, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=602.3199999999999s)]
*  the Israelis were very, very intent [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=606.4s)]
*  about talking about the kind of destruction [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=608.9s)]
*  of all of Hamas, you know, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=611.3399999999999s)]
*  chasing down every last member, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=613.4s)]
*  also getting back the hostages. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=615.3399999999999s)]
*  I think there was a kind of effort [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=617.1s)]
*  by members of the Biden administration, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=618.3s)]
*  members of the US government, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=621.14s)]
*  from Bill Burns, the CIA director, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=622.5s)]
*  to Tony Blinken and Jake Sullivan and others, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=624.2800000000001s)]
*  to kind of talk about what exactly that would take [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=626.2800000000001s)]
*  and what that would require. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=629.4200000000001s)]
*  In a sense, from the US side, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=631.44s)]
*  that there was never really a clear kind of [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=632.9200000000001s)]
*  Israeli explanation, a clear Israeli theory of victory. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=635.2800000000001s)]
*  And the biggest disconnect is when it comes [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=639.2800000000001s)]
*  to this question of governing Gaza, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=642.32s)]
*  and that's true in the short term. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=644.5600000000001s)]
*  You hear Tony Blinken talking about chaos, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=646.76s)]
*  which is allowing Hamas to return. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=649.76s)]
*  If Israel doesn't have some other vision [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=651.62s)]
*  of creating a new Palestinian governing authority in Gaza, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=654.26s)]
*  then it's going to leave the way of Hamas [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=660.0s)]
*  short of a full-scale Israeli occupation, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=662.0s)]
*  which it says it is not going to do. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=664.2s)]
*  So even in the near term, without some kind of vision, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=667.44s)]
*  you are going to really undermine [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=671.72s)]
*  the very basic strategic goals of the Israeli operation. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=673.82s)]
*  But then when you also step back [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=677.62s)]
*  and look at the long-term formula, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=678.98s)]
*  everything that Washington is trying to do [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=680.48s)]
*  when it comes to this bigger regional normalization deal, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=682.5600000000001s)]
*  trying to find some way forward [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=686.5600000000001s)]
*  in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=688.22s)]
*  some path back to a two-state solution, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=689.82s)]
*  or negotiations around a two-state solution, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=693.1s)]
*  it really requires some vision of a Palestinian state [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=695.36s)]
*  and a path to a Palestinian state. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=698.3000000000001s)]
*  That's what all of the regional governments say, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=699.8000000000001s)]
*  whether it's the Saudis or the Emiratis or others. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=702.2800000000001s)]
*  They say they're very willing to get back [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=705.58s)]
*  to some kind of a more formal, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=707.44s)]
*  they're willing to get back to some kind of diplomatic process [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=709.1999999999999s)]
*  with the Israelis, but there also has to be [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=711.5s)]
*  a Palestinian component of this. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=713.8s)]
*  And that's where you get to the politics of this in Israel. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=715.8s)]
*  You have a governing coalition led by Netanyahu, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=719.04s)]
*  but with some extremely right-wing figures [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=721.9s)]
*  who say they will never stand for a path [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=723.68s)]
*  to a Palestinian state. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=727.28s)]
*  They have a very, very different vision [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=728.42s)]
*  of what should happen. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=730.38s)]
*  And so all of the everything [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=731.68s)]
*  that the administration is trying to do [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=733.72s)]
*  is that the government ultimately needs to create [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=735.9399999999999s)]
*  some kind of Palestinian components [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=738.14s)]
*  and political horizon for the Palestinians. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=740.64s)]
*  And that seems still politically impossible for the Israelis. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=743.3399999999999s)]
*  So you can come up with lots of different formulas [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=746.52s)]
*  for how you get a version of the Palestinian Authority, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=749.12s)]
*  which is governing in the West Bank, into Gaza. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=752.56s)]
*  But how you square that with Israeli politics, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=754.7199999999999s)]
*  I still think the problem that the administration [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=757.56s)]
*  still hasn't figured out. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=760.06s)]
*  And you can see that kind of, I have sympathy for them. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=761.5999999999999s)]
*  I imagine you do too, watching these smart people [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=764.96s)]
*  trying to find some way forward. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=769.7600000000001s)]
*  But how you overcome that disconnect [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=771.5600000000001s)]
*  between the Israeli politics and the need for some kind of [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=774.84s)]
*  serious path towards a Palestinian state, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=779.34s)]
*  I think is just something that no one has a clear theory of [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=782.2800000000001s)]
*  at this point. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=784.2800000000001s)]
*  So I have a question for you [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=785.3800000000001s)]
*  that's kind of an existential question, Dan. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=786.6800000000001s)]
*  And you and I have talked a bit about this over the years. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=790.32s)]
*  And I'm genuinely asking this with not knowing [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=793.2s)]
*  the answer myself, which is, okay, foreign affairs is, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=798.14s)]
*  where people can offer their best judgments [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=804.28s)]
*  about the right formulas, the right approaches, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=806.12s)]
*  the right strategies. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=808.48s)]
*  And you just put your finger on something [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=809.98s)]
*  I think incredibly important, which is like, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=811.0600000000001s)]
*  you could have the best formula in the world, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=814.12s)]
*  but it's the politics of Israel [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=815.72s)]
*  and the politics inside the Palestinians [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=818.66s)]
*  that is ultimately the determining factors [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=821.6600000000001s)]
*  whether any strategy can work. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=824.6600000000001s)]
*  I mean, I'm just kind of curious as someone who's engaged [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=827.7s)]
*  at the highest level of strategy on foreign policy, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=831.1400000000001s)]
*  it feels like we're in a time when increasingly politics, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=834.44s)]
*  and this will come up in the China discussion we're gonna have, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=837.08s)]
*  like politics is driving more and more of world events. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=838.74s)]
*  I'm just wondering, how do you marry those two things? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=844.32s)]
*  Like, how do you account for politics [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=847.84s)]
*  in trying to formulate good strategy? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=852.86s)]
*  And this is a huge question I know, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=856.96s)]
*  and it just occurred to me, listen, you talk, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=858.46s)]
*  but I thought, I mean, you must have reflected on this [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=860.36s)]
*  as you edit pieces and think about, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=863.26s)]
*  hey, this is a great idea, but I don't know if this is, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=865.8s)]
*  the politics can make it possible. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=868.9s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it is a kind of central, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=870.4s)]
*  not sure I have an answer to the existential dilemma [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=873.64s)]
*  for wonks that you're laying out and for policymakers. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=877.48s)]
*  It's obviously one that you kind of lived every day [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=879.88s)]
*  in government, and I think that what we try to do, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=882.62s)]
*  the kind of editorial solution to this is to have someone [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=888.0200000000001s)]
*  lay out their kind of optimal plan [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=890.82s)]
*  for getting to a two-state solution to another version of this [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=893.72s)]
*  is you can craft visions of some kind of single state, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=899.4000000000001s)]
*  a binational state for Israelis and Palestinians, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=904.2s)]
*  and then you can have a plan for the Palestinians, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=906.9399999999999s)]
*  that would be another way of addressing [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=910.14s)]
*  where we are currently, but then we would always press [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=913.54s)]
*  the person laying out that plan to say, okay, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=917.54s)]
*  here are the four or five initial steps [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=919.62s)]
*  you would have to take to set us on that path [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=923.38s)]
*  and to show that that's possible. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=926.96s)]
*  It's often the kind of boring part of any piece of writing. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=928.52s)]
*  It's much more fun to kind of spin out these grand visions [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=931.9s)]
*  and then you can kind of critique the failures [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=935.3199999999999s)]
*  of existing policymakers or existing leaders [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=938.02s)]
*  to solve the problem, but it's really those kind of very [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=941.18s)]
*  in the weeds concrete things that you would need to do [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=945.3199999999999s)]
*  when it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=948.46s)]
*  I think what is so, to say it's difficult [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=953.16s)]
*  doesn't even quite capture it, but it makes it such a source [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=956.5s)]
*  of kind of anguish and pain above all for the people [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=958.8s)]
*  who have spent their lives working on this on various sides [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=962.14s)]
*  and I think kind of any one of these paths forward, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=964.86s)]
*  you run into really terrible politics. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=968.3s)]
*  So we've run pieces in recent months and years [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=971.54s)]
*  on what a one-state solution would look like, right? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=976.64s)]
*  People saying, look, there's no path to two states. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=980.22s)]
*  There's not gonna be a Palestinian state [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=983.68s)]
*  in the West Bank and Gaza that the Israelis [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=985.0799999999999s)]
*  are gonna allow to flourish and allow to have anything [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=986.72s)]
*  resembling real sovereignty. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=991.06s)]
*  So we've talked about what a one-state formula [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=992.44s)]
*  would look like, we've similarly had lots of pieces, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=994.48s)]
*  including recent one from Martin Indyk, very long time, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=996.38s)]
*  American policymaker worked on peace negotiations [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1000.26s)]
*  with the Obama administration and long before that [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1003.86s)]
*  on how you get back to a two-state solution from this, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1006.7s)]
*  but they all require essentially changes in leadership, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1009.42s)]
*  though in Israel, a change in the prime minister's office [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1013.5s)]
*  and also on the Palestinian side, you have Mahmoud Abbas, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1017.6s)]
*  who is quite old, not super effective, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1020.86s)]
*  doesn't have lots of corruption in the Palestinian authorities, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1024.0s)]
*  so you can kind of spin these out, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1027.2s)]
*  but again, it's gonna come down to the decisions [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1030.54s)]
*  of political actors and in these cases, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1033.8799999999999s)]
*  people in both Palestinians and Israelis coming up [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1037.78s)]
*  with some kind of change in leadership [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1041.58s)]
*  to really unlock this, and you know this better than anyone, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1044.18s)]
*  there are tools that American diplomats have [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1048.4199999999998s)]
*  to put pressure on that and try to shape that, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1051.76s)]
*  you had Chuck Schumer, a senator who's been [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1053.56s)]
*  a very, very long time supporter of Israel [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1057.7399999999998s)]
*  calling for a change in leadership, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1059.6399999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure that that really had a huge effect [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1061.3999999999999s)]
*  on politics in Israel, if anything, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1064.6s)]
*  it might have helped me be a little bit unintentionally. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1066.08s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think you put your finger on it, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1069.1799999999998s)]
*  the best laid plans do rely upon politics, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1074.3799999999999s)]
*  and moving to another issue in which [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1078.8200000000002s)]
*  there's domestic politics on both sides, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1080.8200000000002s)]
*  the US-China relationship, and this is really an area [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1083.0s)]
*  that you're one of the leading experts on, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1085.76s)]
*  and so I wanna start by talking about the increasing, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1089.0s)]
*  well, it's been increasing for a while, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1092.94s)]
*  economic competition between the US and China. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1094.28s)]
*  President Biden has now announced [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1097.04s)]
*  an aggressive new round of tariffs on Chinese goods, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1098.44s)]
*  including steel and aluminum, semiconductors, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1101.3400000000001s)]
*  electric vehicles, battery components, critical minerals, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1103.3400000000001s)]
*  and other things like cell cells, cranes, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1106.04s)]
*  and medical products. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1107.54s)]
*  The administration has been framing the policy [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1109.04s)]
*  as a way to invest in the resilience of our own economy [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1111.22s)]
*  and our domestic production, in large part, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1114.88s)]
*  responding to overproduction from China. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1117.96s)]
*  We were lucky, Dan, to have US Trade Representative [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1121.0s)]
*  Catherine Tai here in the studio last week, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1124.0s)]
*  we're gonna be using that in a variety of episodes, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1126.56s)]
*  but let's begin by listening to a clip of what she said [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1130.54s)]
*  in terms of the administration's motivations [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1133.1s)]
*  for the Paris that she obviously played a central role in. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1134.92s)]
*  You have to start with what is the challenge [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1137.4s)]
*  that we are facing today? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1140.5s)]
*  So the inequities in the relationship, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1141.8600000000001s)]
*  what we in trade parlance call [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1144.14s)]
*  non-market policies and practices, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1146.0s)]
*  of which IPR abuses, forced tech transfer, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1148.38s)]
*  comprise one aspect, which is economic policies [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1151.74s)]
*  that are made by Beijing that are not based on, say, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1155.74s)]
*  a supply and demand model. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1160.0800000000002s)]
*  And the impacts that those decisions made in Beijing [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1162.78s)]
*  will have on markets far and wide [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1168.96s)]
*  because of the very interconnected and open nature [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1171.22s)]
*  of the global economy and our economy in particular. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1176.16s)]
*  So you start there and you see the amount of exposure [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1180.76s)]
*  that our market has to these types of practices [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1185.78s)]
*  and the negative effects. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1188.92s)]
*  And then you think about where we're trying to go. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1191.84s)]
*  We're trying to get to a place where we have more leverage [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1194.7s)]
*  with respect to persuading China to change its policies, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1198.78s)]
*  to blunt the negative impacts on our economy. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1205.02s)]
*  A place where if they don't change, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1207.58s)]
*  we can increase the resilience of our economy [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1211.52s)]
*  and our market, our ability to retain opportunities [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1214.52s)]
*  and create jobs here, especially in critical sectors. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1218.1799999999998s)]
*  And then you have to map out [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1221.8799999999999s)]
*  if we're not where we want to be today [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1223.56s)]
*  and we can articulate where we want to be in the future, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1225.86s)]
*  what is the best path to transition [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1230.26s)]
*  to get from today to tomorrow? [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1233.24s)]
*  So, Dan, that was very diplomatically stated [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1235.6399999999999s)]
*  by Catherine Tai. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1239.48s)]
*  Not surprisingly, China reacted negatively [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1243.9199999999998s)]
*  to these tariffs. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1247.06s)]
*  I just wanted to ask you one, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1248.7s)]
*  how aggressive do you think this move is? [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1251.64s)]
*  How do you situate it in terms of the US-China competition? [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1254.08s)]
*  And how would you decode Ambassador Tai's kind of, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1256.94s)]
*  you know, framing of how China's manipulating markets? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1261.18s)]
*  So this is in some ways, you know, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1264.82s)]
*  of a piece with a lot of moves that have probably started [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1267.06s)]
*  even the Obama administration, I think, you know, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1271.0s)]
*  a focus on the ways in which China's, you know, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1272.84s)]
*  economic growth and role in the global economy [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1277.58s)]
*  had affected American workers. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1279.66s)]
*  You know, some of that was just the sheer fact [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1282.46s)]
*  of China becoming this huge exporter [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1284.36s)]
*  and that really undermining manufacturing employment [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1286.92s)]
*  and large-scale United States, the, you know, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1290.66s)]
*  quote-unquote, China shock. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1292.7s)]
*  Some of that was about a new focus [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1294.3s)]
*  on theft of intellectual property, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1295.94s)]
*  which Ambassador Tai was alluding to. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1297.84s)]
*  And, you know, concerns about China kind of taking [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1301.96s)]
*  American tech and using that for either its own, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1305.66s)]
*  just economic advantage or military advantage. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1308.3000000000002s)]
*  But, you know, this has been kind of on a steady upward curve [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1312.5400000000002s)]
*  kind of growing exponentially year by year [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1315.48s)]
*  through the Trump administration. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1318.68s)]
*  And then Biden has really, I think, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1320.6200000000001s)]
*  amped it up to the surprise of the Chinese. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1322.42s)]
*  And it's not what they expected, I think, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1324.8600000000001s)]
*  when Biden came into office, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1326.1200000000001s)]
*  but when it's come to anything from, you know, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1328.84s)]
*  export controls on advanced semiconductors [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1331.34s)]
*  to restrictions on investment into certain Chinese sectors, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1335.02s)]
*  keeping the Trump tariffs on, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1339.32s)]
*  and now, you know, really ramping these up [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1340.82s)]
*  in pretty startling ways. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1344.02s)]
*  So even I think people have been paying attention [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1345.32s)]
*  pretty closely to the economic, you know, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1347.66s)]
*  to call it economic offensive is too strong [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1351.66s)]
*  and probably using a CCP talking point there. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1353.64s)]
*  But, you know, to the economic tools, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1356.2s)]
*  the economic leverage that the United States [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1359.1000000000001s)]
*  is trying to use, both the pressure China in certain ways [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1360.3000000000002s)]
*  and also to protect our own, you know, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1363.2600000000002s)]
*  critical sectors and our economy from the Chinese. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1365.8000000000002s)]
*  You know, this surprised me, frankly, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1368.64s)]
*  just in terms of some of the numbers [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1370.38s)]
*  that we saw the 100% tariff on electric vehicles, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1372.74s)]
*  something that, you know, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1376.3400000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump was talking about, right? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1377.18s)]
*  That was a Trump promise [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1378.5200000000002s)]
*  that Biden basically preempted. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1380.3200000000002s)]
*  So it's a pretty striking, you know, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1382.5800000000002s)]
*  striking step forward, even if it's not, you know, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1385.16s)]
*  in the interest of the Chinese in keeping [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1387.56s)]
*  with the trends we've seen. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1388.9s)]
*  I mean, two things that really strike me, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1391.56s)]
*  listening to Catherine Tai [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1393.8s)]
*  and then looking at these broadly, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1396.4s)]
*  I mean, one is just watching the kind of, you know, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1398.1s)]
*  politics and economics of China and the United States [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1402.78s)]
*  just kind of crash right into each other. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1405.12s)]
*  So, you know, as listeners probably are pretty well aware, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1407.02s)]
*  you know, the Chinese economy, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1410.92s)]
*  which had been growing at incredibly high rates [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1412.08s)]
*  for a long time has been really struggling [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1414.22s)]
*  in the last couple of years in the hope for kind of, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1415.96s)]
*  you know, big bounce coming out of COVID, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1418.3200000000002s)]
*  didn't exactly happen. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1420.2s)]
*  You have reports of extremely high, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1422.5600000000002s)]
*  you know, youth unemployment in China, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1425.3600000000001s)]
*  like above 20% in cities, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1426.9s)]
*  which is pretty scary if you're a Chinese leader [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1428.8400000000001s)]
*  where a lot of your kind of legitimacy and security, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1432.44s)]
*  you know, the reason why you don't give your people [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1435.24s)]
*  political freedoms, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1437.44s)]
*  you're delivering this incredible economic growth. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1438.28s)]
*  Suddenly that's slowing growth [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1441.44s)]
*  is a really critical threat to you. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1443.48s)]
*  And what Xi Jinping has done is not, you know, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1445.7s)]
*  resort to the kinds of economic reforms [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1449.36s)]
*  that Western economists might tell him to make, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1451.2s)]
*  but instead is just really investing [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1453.56s)]
*  in these huge export sectors, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1456.04s)]
*  electric vehicles being a great example of them [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1459.44s)]
*  where they're subsidizing these companies [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1461.6s)]
*  and trying to ship just incredible amounts [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1463.8799999999999s)]
*  of goods out into the world. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1466.02s)]
*  So that's, you know, kind of critical [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1467.24s)]
*  to the regime security in China, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1469.02s)]
*  to the future leadership in China, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1471.52s)]
*  and then the next thing you know, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1473.1399999999999s)]
*  smack into the political and economic interests [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1474.1799999999998s)]
*  of the Biden administration and an election year [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1477.58s)]
*  when there's going to be a lot of, you know, [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1480.58s)]
*  pressure to protect these sectors. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1482.9199999999998s)]
*  So even with all of the efforts, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1484.96s)]
*  I think pretty well-meaning and well-handled efforts [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1487.52s)]
*  over the last six or so months [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1490.26s)]
*  since President Biden and Xi Jinping [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1492.6s)]
*  met in San Francisco in November [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1494.96s)]
*  to bring some degree of just stability [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1496.8s)]
*  to the U.S.-China relationship, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1499.1599999999999s)]
*  you know, not to make it dramatically better, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1500.3999999999999s)]
*  but to make it a little bit less scary and unstable. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1502.26s)]
*  I think a lot of that's going to be kind of swamped [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1506.14s)]
*  by just these very, very different economic interests [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1509.6s)]
*  that are running smack into each other here. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1512.38s)]
*  And then one other thing that really, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1515.48s)]
*  I think, is quite striking in what you hear from, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1517.22s)]
*  you know, Catherine Tai, but also from Jake Sullivan [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1520.48s)]
*  and Tony Blinken and the president himself, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1522.68s)]
*  just how broadly we think of national security now. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1525.42s)]
*  So, you know, when you look at the things [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1528.22s)]
*  that fall under those tariffs, you know, semiconductors, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1529.54s)]
*  you know, that makes sense as something that we think of [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1534.08s)]
*  as part of national security, but, you know, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1536.28s)]
*  solar cells and cranes and medical equipment, you know. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1538.58s)]
*  It used to be that there were a few things [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1543.52s)]
*  that we would think of as kind of having [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1545.36s)]
*  special national security carve-outs [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1546.9s)]
*  when it came to the economic relationship, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1548.96s)]
*  but then a lot of things you could kind of, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1550.46s)]
*  you know, trade normally, and we kind of leave it to businesses [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1552.26s)]
*  to figure out what made sense from a commercial [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1554.54s)]
*  or financial perspective. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1557.2s)]
*  And now there's just more and more that's getting swept [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1558.52s)]
*  into this category of national security. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1561.26s)]
*  And, you know, you can look at each one of those [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1562.96s)]
*  and even things that, you know, the average person [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1565.2s)]
*  might not think immediately have big national security [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1568.54s)]
*  implications when you, you know, hear the explanation. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1571.78s)]
*  It does make sense, you know, when you hear that the cranes, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1574.74s)]
*  for example, have sensors that might be sending information [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1577.74s)]
*  about American ports back to China. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1580.6200000000001s)]
*  So, you know, all of that makes sense, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1583.68s)]
*  but it does kind of raise this question of where this ends, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1585.54s)]
*  right, if you assume that you want some, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1588.98s)]
*  to preserve some economic relationship, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1590.68s)]
*  that it's good for, you know, the health of the American economy, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1592.32s)]
*  that it's probably, you know, probably good [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1595.16s)]
*  for the relationship to have some balance [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1596.56s)]
*  that comes from an economic relationship. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1598.8600000000001s)]
*  It's hard to know where you stop kind of adding things [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1601.16s)]
*  to that category of national security. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1603.66s)]
*  Yeah, well, this is a good, this is, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1605.46s)]
*  we're about to wind up here, Dan, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1607.2s)]
*  to the question I was most excited to ask you. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1608.74s)]
*  To set that up, we have one more short clip from Kath and Ty, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1612.08s)]
*  and then I'll ask you the question after it. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1614.82s)]
*  I think that there are some people [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1616.32s)]
*  who were surprised by that. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1618.4s)]
*  I think there are people who maybe aren't very read into [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1620.5s)]
*  the challenges of the U.S.-China trade [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1623.44s)]
*  and economic relationship. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1625.1s)]
*  Ben, I know you served in the Obama administration. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1626.7s)]
*  In that second term of the Obama administration, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1630.68s)]
*  so 2012 through 2016, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1633.04s)]
*  I think that it was pretty clear that this relationship, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1637.42s)]
*  the tensions were really intensifying. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1641.1399999999999s)]
*  Over the course of that time, if you remember, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1644.28s)]
*  there was that moment where President Obama [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1646.58s)]
*  brings Xi Jinping aside, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1649.02s)]
*  at least as it's been reported and says, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1651.36s)]
*  hey, we know what you guys are doing [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1653.12s)]
*  with respect to cyber thefts. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1655.06s)]
*  Yeah, I remember that well. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1657.56s)]
*  You need to stop it, and that got reported out [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1659.06s)]
*  and it was commonly known. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1661.56s)]
*  So, you know, I think just on this issue alone, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1663.3999999999999s)]
*  but more broadly in the economic competitive, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1666.6s)]
*  competitive tensions between the United States and China, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1670.82s)]
*  I feel like no matter who was going to take over [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1674.66s)]
*  as U.S. president in 2017, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1677.46s)]
*  that this relationship was going to be [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1680.2s)]
*  on a very, very different track. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1682.4s)]
*  Okay, I actually thought that set up [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1684.44s)]
*  something really well, Dan, which is... [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1686.7s)]
*  And what you're saying at the beginning there [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1689.94s)]
*  is that people might be surprised [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1691.44s)]
*  that Biden's gone this far on tariffs, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1693.44s)]
*  but they shouldn't be, right? [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1694.64s)]
*  What I want to set up here is you have a really great issue, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1696.28s)]
*  and I'm not just saying this because I write for Foreign Affairs [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1699.46s)]
*  sometimes and you're a friend of mine. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1701.3000000000002s)]
*  This China issue that is out now, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1703.3600000000001s)]
*  Can China Remake the World? [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1705.24s)]
*  I really liked it because it surfaced a debate. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1707.14s)]
*  And to break this down, we're going to nerd out here a bit, Dan. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1710.44s)]
*  But for people who don't follow this intricately, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1714.78s)]
*  you know, the U.S. establishment, for lack of a better term, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1717.42s)]
*  you know, for a long time after the Cold War, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1720.52s)]
*  kind of bet on engagement with China, right? [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1722.52s)]
*  The idea that by engaging China, [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1724.38s)]
*  we make them stakeholders in the international system, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1726.5600000000002s)]
*  perhaps as they plug into the global economy, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1729.46s)]
*  they might liberalize. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1731.76s)]
*  And as Catherine Tai was indicating on the economy, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1734.16s)]
*  but the same is true on national security and politics, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1738.54s)]
*  by the end of the Obama administration, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1741.74s)]
*  I think there was a sense of like, wait a second, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1743.14s)]
*  Xi Jinping is in charge. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1745.24s)]
*  Their behavior in terms of trade practices [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1747.0s)]
*  is getting more concerning. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1749.28s)]
*  They're claiming the whole South China Sea. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1750.92s)]
*  They're becoming more threatening to Taiwan. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1753.52s)]
*  And there was this kind of decision [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1755.88s)]
*  that everybody made, Dan, like, on mass, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1757.6s)]
*  like, we need to become hawks on China. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1760.76s)]
*  Like, we need to correct here. We need a correction. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1762.36s)]
*  And she names it. You know, it's starting with Trump, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1765.06s)]
*  but whoever was president in 2017 [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1767.84s)]
*  was going to be a harder line on trade, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1769.8799999999999s)]
*  but probably on a bunch of stuff. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1771.78s)]
*  As you indicated, with Biden, this has been, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1773.78s)]
*  we talked about the trade piece, it's manifesting the tariffs. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1776.24s)]
*  There's also export controls, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1779.48s)]
*  trying to choke off inputs to Chinese technology. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1780.8799999999999s)]
*  But also, like a far more, I think, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1783.58s)]
*  containment, confrontational approach [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1785.62s)]
*  in terms of building U.S. alliances in the Asia Pacific, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1787.86s)]
*  around the South China Sea, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1790.8s)]
*  a far more of a willingness to arm Taiwan [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1792.76s)]
*  with things that are designed for a China contingency. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1795.8s)]
*  What I like about your foreign affairs issue is, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1800.8s)]
*  you kind of, I think, are intentionally reconsidering this. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1803.48s)]
*  And not saying it was wrong, but saying, like, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1808.04s)]
*  here's a variety of different perspectives. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1809.8799999999999s)]
*  And so you've got the hawkish view from Mike Gallagher [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1811.4199999999998s)]
*  and Matt Pottinger. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1814.74s)]
*  You've got the, you know, I think, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1817.04s)]
*  a kind of view of China's alternative order. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1819.56s)]
*  You've got the kind of alarmist view [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1822.06s)]
*  that China's part of an axis of bad guys. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1823.38s)]
*  You've got a really good piece from a friend of ours, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1826.82s)]
*  Evan Maderos, about, hey, we're making a mistake here. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1829.3s)]
*  We're acting like China's getting weaker. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1831.9s)]
*  We need to realize they're going to be here, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1834.2s)]
*  they're going to be players, right? [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1836.26s)]
*  And so I just, I want to take this opportunity [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1837.94s)]
*  to ask you to step back. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1839.94s)]
*  Where do you see this debate? [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1841.64s)]
*  Like, because I'm, as you know, and I, you know, spoiler alert, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1842.8s)]
*  might have a piece coming for you, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1845.96s)]
*  where I'm beginning to get alarmed at, like, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1847.24s)]
*  the logic of all this. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1849.14s)]
*  Like you said, we're crashing into each other. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1850.6s)]
*  There's reasons for it. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1852.44s)]
*  But I kind of worry about, you know, like, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1854.18s)]
*  in the, when we've already got two wars going, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1857.74s)]
*  like, we don't need a third, you know. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1860.08s)]
*  How do you see the relationship now? [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1862.58s)]
*  And do you see some reconsideration, you know, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1864.18s)]
*  if you had the engagement approach under Obama, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1867.82s)]
*  and then you had the hawkish approach under Trump, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1870.16s)]
*  and then a Biden version of it? [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1871.84s)]
*  Do you think we're due for some other correction, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1873.72s)]
*  or how do you see things? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1876.22s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great question. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1877.36s)]
*  I mean, I go back to a piece, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1879.36s)]
*  not to be overly self-referential here, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1881.12s)]
*  that, you know, now two senior Biden officials, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1883.06s)]
*  Kurt Campbell, who's the Deputy Secretary of State, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1886.76s)]
*  and kind of the, you know, most prominent, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1888.56s)]
*  kind of Asia hand in the administration, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1890.76s)]
*  and then Eli Ratner, who runs Asia Policy of the Pentagon, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1892.84s)]
*  wrote for Foreign Affairs in 2018, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1896.4s)]
*  where they kind of declared the end of the engagement [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1899.08s)]
*  paradigm, you know, this was something [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1901.62s)]
*  that was happening under Trump, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1903.02s)]
*  but it was coming from, you know, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1904.22s)]
*  two people who had been in the Obama administration, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1905.8s)]
*  and had been kind of very associated [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1908.6s)]
*  with that engagement model. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1909.8999999999999s)]
*  And, you know, what they argued, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1911.8s)]
*  I think it's easy to caricature this a little bit, [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1913.1s)]
*  but the basic argument is that, you know, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1914.74s)]
*  we thought that by engaging with China [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1916.74s)]
*  through the, you know, 90s and aughts, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1919.58s)]
*  and I think into the, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1921.78s)]
*  he's the first part of the Obama administration, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1922.82s)]
*  we would, you know, not necessarily see, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1925.04s)]
*  you know, China become just like us, right, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1927.02s)]
*  a kind of nice, nice democracy. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1929.42s)]
*  I agree with this everywhere, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1930.74s)]
*  but it would become, you know, kind of more, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1932.44s)]
*  a different kind of player internationally, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1935.0800000000002s)]
*  and a little bit easier to work with, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1937.0800000000002s)]
*  and we'd see, you know, if not democratization exactly, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1938.3600000000001s)]
*  kind of political reform. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1941.5600000000002s)]
*  You know, this was all kind of a piece with [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1942.72s)]
*  that kind of end of history moment of the 1990s. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1945.16s)]
*  And once we could know, and it was okay, [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1948.5600000000002s)]
*  where we could kind of get our heads around [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1950.5600000000002s)]
*  China becoming richer and bigger and more powerful [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1952.5400000000002s)]
*  in a bigger part of the, you know, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1955.74s)]
*  kind of global decision making, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1957.98s)]
*  if it was becoming a little bit more, you know, liberal, [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1959.56s)]
*  not in the American political sense, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1962.94s)]
*  but in the, you know, kind of global sense, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1964.84s)]
*  and was kind of a part of the, you know, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1967.4s)]
*  quote unquote rules-based order that we had been part of. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1969.84s)]
*  And when it was no longer becoming more liberal, [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1973.84s)]
*  this really happened, I think, under Xi Jinping, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1976.6200000000001s)]
*  that people really woke up to it, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1978.82s)]
*  that we were seeing a different kind of China [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1980.6200000000001s)]
*  that was going to be very nationalist, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1982.18s)]
*  was actually going to be kind of moving backwards [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1984.52s)]
*  on a lot of the kind of political and economic reform [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1986.22s)]
*  that we had been seeing. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1989.74s)]
*  And so, you know, we had been seeing [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1991.08s)]
*  a lot of questions that had been going [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1992.84s)]
*  in a different direction before Xi Jinping. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1995.48s)]
*  We were just dealing with a really, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=1998.8799999999999s)]
*  really different kind of actor. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2000.36s)]
*  And I think we've been trying to figure out [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2002.56s)]
*  exactly how to understand that relationship, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2004.72s)]
*  you know, really ever since. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2007.22s)]
*  And Donald Trump, I think, in his, you know, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2008.52s)]
*  Trumpy way kind of really blew up that paradigm [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2010.6s)]
*  in a way that, you know, if you'd imagined [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2013.36s)]
*  a third Obama term or Hillary Clinton term, [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2015.1s)]
*  you know, it would have been a lot more of a revolution. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2017.24s)]
*  But it was happening. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2018.88s)]
*  And the question now is where we think this should go. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2021.04s)]
*  And I think what's, you know, illuminating about that piece [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2024.68s)]
*  that you referred to by Matt Pottinger and Mike Gallagher [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2028.18s)]
*  and Matt Pottinger was the senior Trump figure on China [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2030.38s)]
*  and, you know, the one who was doing a lot [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2034.42s)]
*  of the actual policy work to make that change. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2035.96s)]
*  Mike Gallagher is a congressman, just resigned from Congress, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2038.72s)]
*  but was leading the China subcommittee, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2041.96s)]
*  very hawkish on China. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2044.4s)]
*  You know, they're willing to come out and say, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2046.1399999999999s)]
*  when we look at China now, we think we need to make [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2047.54s)]
*  American policy all about changing the nature [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2051.18s)]
*  of the regime in Beijing. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2054.44s)]
*  And that doesn't mean they want to, you know, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2056.48s)]
*  launch a war against China, you know, Iraq 2003 style. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2058.08s)]
*  But they do say we need to accept a lot of risk [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2061.92s)]
*  and not really care about having [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2064.66s)]
*  a especially functional relationship [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2066.22s)]
*  with the Chinese government and really set out [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2068.46s)]
*  to, you know, weaken its economy and put pressure on it, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2071.02s)]
*  you know, both in its own region, but also domestically, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2075.22s)]
*  which is a risky strategy. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2078.16s)]
*  You know, they kind of say, look, this is a danger, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2079.56s)]
*  really dangerous strategy, but we have to do it. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2081.2599999999998s)]
*  And I think you have people who are kind of [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2084.3599999999997s)]
*  justifiably kind of nervous about setting that [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2090.58s)]
*  as our objective, but really struggling to figure out [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2092.94s)]
*  what a different kind of relationship looks like. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2095.24s)]
*  So you have, you know, I'm sympathetic. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2097.3199999999997s)]
*  The Biden administration will say, look, we don't, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2099.08s)]
*  we want to manage competition. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2100.92s)]
*  We want to find a way to compete where we need to. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2102.42s)]
*  And I think the tariff announcement today [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2105.78s)]
*  is a pretty good example of, you know, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2107.78s)]
*  a pretty hard-edged strategy, but we're, you know, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2109.78s)]
*  we're not going to set out to change China. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2113.82s)]
*  Our goal is not to change the fundamental nature of China, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2116.0s)]
*  but I think it's still a challenge that's out there [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2119.36s)]
*  for, you know, all of us in the foreign policy world [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2123.06s)]
*  to try to come up with some framework [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2126.34s)]
*  that will allow American presidents, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2128.6s)]
*  you know, again, of either party, [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2131.4s)]
*  to address the real threats when it comes to both [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2132.7s)]
*  some of the economic practices, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2135.48s)]
*  the things that China's doing in its region, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2136.7799999999997s)]
*  but without going, you know, all the way [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2139.24s)]
*  to the very, very hard line policy [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2141.8199999999997s)]
*  that Gallagher and Pottinger lay out. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2143.52s)]
*  And so, you know, that to me is in some ways [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2147.12s)]
*  the kind of biggest question [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2149.08s)]
*  for American foreign policy right now. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2150.06s)]
*  I mean, do you have a view on what our objective should be [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2151.3199999999997s)]
*  other than the, you know, managed competition, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2155.7599999999998s)]
*  as Pottinger and Gallagher say, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2157.7999999999997s)]
*  like it is about process, not about outcome? [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2159.6s)]
*  I, yeah, I... And look, I actually thought that was useful. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2162.12s)]
*  I think Mike Gallagher is a thoughtful guy, actually. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2164.82s)]
*  You know, he's more hawkish than I am, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2167.22s)]
*  but like I, you know, it's good for them [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2169.06s)]
*  to lay that baseline down. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2172.52s)]
*  I mean, my view, Dan, as I've been wrestling with this, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2173.62s)]
*  is Xi Jinping is a concerning figure. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2177.2599999999998s)]
*  He is pushing the envelope in a lot of ways. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2181.2s)]
*  And there is a limit to what can be accomplished [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2183.2999999999997s)]
*  through engagement with him. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2187.68s)]
*  I guess in the, where I am right now is, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2189.12s)]
*  I think in the kind of enthusiasm [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2192.2s)]
*  of the competition strategy, right? [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2194.16s)]
*  And like you said, even with the tariffs, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2196.0s)]
*  like everything is national security, [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2197.6s)]
*  everything is a threat. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2199.04s)]
*  I worry that there's an unintentional logic [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2201.44s)]
*  that leads to conflict. In other words, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2204.38s)]
*  I actually think the number one objective, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2206.38s)]
*  and this is where I might differ, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2209.2799999999997s)]
*  with Gallagher and Pottinger, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2211.32s)]
*  is actually avoiding a war, you know? [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2213.72s)]
*  I mean, that's an objective in its own right. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2215.52s)]
*  And I think in the competition, [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2217.52s)]
*  we may have lost sight of hate. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2219.82s)]
*  Because even as someone who really cares about Taiwan, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2222.12s)]
*  the best thing for Taiwan is for there not to be a war too, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2224.7200000000003s)]
*  you know? And so, I think reintroducing that [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2226.96s)]
*  as an objective in the relationship. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2231.46s)]
*  And I think that's what Biden's kind of been doing [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2233.16s)]
*  with some of the outreach. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2234.94s)]
*  But then also, as a part of that, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2236.44s)]
*  I think it's bad if the entirety of the relationship [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2239.44s)]
*  is negative, in part because we have things [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2241.44s)]
*  where we have to work together, you know? [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2243.28s)]
*  There's no norm building around artificial intelligence [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2245.04s)]
*  that excludes China. And so, it's kind of weird. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2248.14s)]
*  We're trying to limit their ability to develop AI, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2250.44s)]
*  but they're going to develop it. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2252.14s)]
*  And so, we need to really get under the hope with them [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2253.44s)]
*  in protecting our populations from the excesses of AI. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2256.84s)]
*  There is no climate solution without China. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2261.22s)]
*  And if we just spend the next 10 years [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2263.76s)]
*  fighting over critical mineral supply chains, [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2265.96s)]
*  I think that's incredibly inefficient [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2268.96s)]
*  in dealing with the climate crisis. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2270.3s)]
*  And so, to me, you know, in addition to that, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2271.8s)]
*  in addition to avoiding a war, like finding ways [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2274.88s)]
*  to begin to thread their block together with ours, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2278.32s)]
*  you know, on some of these issues like AI and climate, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2282.2200000000003s)]
*  I know that's not easy. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2286.86s)]
*  Like, wolf warrior diplomacy makes it a little harder too. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2288.76s)]
*  But I just, if it's a pendulum that swung very hard [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2292.6s)]
*  in the hawkish direction, I'm not arguing it goes [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2296.34s)]
*  all the way back in that direction, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2298.5s)]
*  but I think we need to take it a little bit back here. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2299.6s)]
*  Because right now, it feels like everything [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2302.6400000000003s)]
*  is a nail, and every, you know, to use a cliche, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2304.94s)]
*  everything is a nail, so we just keep reaching for the hammer, [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2307.92s)]
*  you know? And I thought your issue, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2310.02s)]
*  you kind of elevated, okay, let's at least start thinking [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2312.46s)]
*  about this again, you know? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2315.42s)]
*  It's worth saying to the credit of the Biden administration, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2316.6200000000003s)]
*  they're having, I think this week, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2318.76s)]
*  the first talks with China on AI, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2321.46s)]
*  and it's, you know, it's not super high level. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2323.6600000000003s)]
*  It's probably not getting to the kind of really, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2326.04s)]
*  you know, hardest questions when it comes [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2328.84s)]
*  to the kind of military risks and, you know, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2330.2400000000002s)]
*  the kind of scariest risks when you think about [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2331.98s)]
*  both the China and the US could be applying AI [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2333.96s)]
*  in a, you know, a war context, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2336.0s)]
*  but it's that they are beginning to have these talks, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2338.0s)]
*  and, you know, the fact that we can apply tariffs [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2341.2400000000002s)]
*  on the one hand, but also continue to talk about those, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2344.78s)]
*  you know, big, big shared issues that you lay out, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2347.48s)]
*  I think is a sign of a, you know, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2349.7200000000003s)]
*  step forward in the relationship, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2351.86s)]
*  even if, you know, that might be kind of a low bar, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2353.2200000000003s)]
*  but it's an important one. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2356.1600000000003s)]
*  I still think the other, you know, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2357.46s)]
*  really essential part of this, and this is something that, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2358.96s)]
*  you know, I know this, I imagine this will resonate with you, [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2361.4s)]
*  but it's the focus of the piece by Liz Economy and the issue, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2363.9s)]
*  that, you know, China's actually done a pretty good job [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2367.34s)]
*  of convincing much of the world that it's on the side [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2369.58s)]
*  of kind of, you know, constructive evolution, [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2372.94s)]
*  and it's not great for the United States [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2375.2400000000002s)]
*  to look like we're the kind of, you know, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2377.54s)]
*  bitter defenders of an old order [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2379.48s)]
*  that no one's that happy with, [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2381.7200000000003s)]
*  while China is the kind of advocate of change [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2383.02s)]
*  that will appeal to, you know, governments and populations [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2385.12s)]
*  in a lot of the world, especially developing world. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2389.1600000000003s)]
*  So part of, you know, working with China on those solutions [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2392.14s)]
*  is making clear to people in, you know, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2395.2799999999997s)]
*  in the rest of Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2399.2799999999997s)]
*  and Latin America, even in Europe, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2401.66s)]
*  that, you know, the US is willing to be a kind of, [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2403.62s)]
*  you know, constructive cooperative player [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2406.56s)]
*  when it comes to changing the way [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2408.36s)]
*  the international system works. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2409.86s)]
*  Yeah, that's very well said. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2411.1s)]
*  I mean, this, you know, we're going to make a turn here [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2412.86s)]
*  to the other great power. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2415.2s)]
*  I mean, if the US is kind of the status quo power [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2416.4s)]
*  that's defending international order, [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2419.2999999999997s)]
*  that, as you say, I think rightly, [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2420.7599999999998s)]
*  a lot of people in the global south in particular [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2422.3599999999997s)]
*  don't think works for them. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2425.06s)]
*  China is kind of building a self-interested global order. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2426.4199999999996s)]
*  The wrecking ball is Russia. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2428.6s)]
*  Xi Jinping's actually gonna be hosting Vladimir Putin [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2430.2999999999997s)]
*  in the coming weeks, so that'll spotlight [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2432.3999999999996s)]
*  the China-Russia relationship. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2433.8999999999996s)]
*  But I wanted to get your response [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2435.74s)]
*  to just the latest out of Russia and Ukraine. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2437.5s)]
*  Russia has recently launched two cross-border offensives [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2440.2799999999997s)]
*  in the northern Ukrainian region around Kharkiv. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2444.3799999999997s)]
*  President Zelensky said they anticipated these attacks [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2447.18s)]
*  and was sending reinforcements to the region, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2449.82s)]
*  but it's definitely a troubling sign for Ukraine. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2451.76s)]
*  According to Politico, the governor of Kharkiv [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2454.02s)]
*  said that more than 6,000 civilians [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2456.2200000000003s)]
*  have been evacuated from the region. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2458.26s)]
*  Russia was able to advance in part due to delays [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2460.0600000000004s)]
*  in Western military aid, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2463.1400000000003s)]
*  thanks to the dysfunctional US Congress. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2465.0s)]
*  Now, he said Kharkiv is safe, but, you know, [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2469.48s)]
*  a Ukrainian monitoring group called Deep State Map [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2471.84s)]
*  warns that an estimated 40,000 Russian troops [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2474.2400000000002s)]
*  are in the region and could continue to gain [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2476.92s)]
*  ground, putting the over 1 million civilians [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2479.52s)]
*  in Kharkiv at risk. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2482.32s)]
*  And just to add in another bit of not-so-great news here, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2484.16s)]
*  there's an analysis done by The New York Times recently [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2488.3s)]
*  that suggested that Ukraine is increasingly failing [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2490.6s)]
*  to stop Russian missiles. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2492.6s)]
*  This comes from a combination of Ukraine needing [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2494.06s)]
*  more air defense systems and also Russia [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2496.7s)]
*  adapting their tactics. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2499.2400000000002s)]
*  Look, I mean, stepping back, Dan, the bottom line is, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2501.1s)]
*  Russia seems to be on the offensive, [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2505.44s)]
*  not dramatically changing the front line, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2508.08s)]
*  but if there is change, it's moving in the Russian direction. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2509.88s)]
*  But also there are these kind of worrying signs [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2512.52s)]
*  that the kind of larger population in Russia, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2514.42s)]
*  combined with like an adaptive military-industrial complex, [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2517.92s)]
*  might be beginning to punch holes [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2521.56s)]
*  in some of the Ukrainian defenses. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2523.56s)]
*  You know, you've been obviously following this issue closely. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2526.62s)]
*  What does this mean? [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2530.84s)]
*  What do US and Western policymakers [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2532.4s)]
*  need to think about differently in terms of, [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2535.88s)]
*  if the strategy for the last couple of years has been, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2538.78s)]
*  just get as many weapons as these guys as possible, [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2541.2200000000003s)]
*  and kind of hope that the, you know, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2543.62s)]
*  what was the Ukrainian counter-offensive works, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2545.62s)]
*  we're clearly on the other side of that. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2547.78s)]
*  I mean, where do you see the policy discussion going, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2549.38s)]
*  given these developments? [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2552.4s)]
*  Yeah, so just one thing I would add on Kharkiv, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2554.2000000000003s)]
*  you know, it was in the fall of 2022 [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2558.2000000000003s)]
*  that the Ukrainians drove the Russians out of Kharkiv, [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2563.16s)]
*  it's, you know, second biggest city, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2566.64s)]
*  important province in Ukraine. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2568.7s)]
*  And that was kind of this amazing moment [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2570.74s)]
*  that we all watched when it seemed like, [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2572.68s)]
*  you know, the Ukrainians really could win this war. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2575.7799999999997s)]
*  It was a moment of such incredible hope. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2578.9199999999996s)]
*  So the symbolic, you know, the grim symbolic value [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2580.7799999999997s)]
*  of Kharkiv once again being under threat [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2584.7799999999997s)]
*  is I just think a kind of searing reminder of where we are [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2587.16s)]
*  and also what the cost. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2590.6s)]
*  It's worth saying again and again what the costs of the delay [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2591.82s)]
*  and getting that assistance package to Ukraine has been [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2594.6200000000003s)]
*  because of, you know, our own dysfunctional politics [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2598.7000000000003s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2601.4s)]
*  But when you kind of step back and think about [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2603.1000000000004s)]
*  where this war goes from here, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2606.5400000000004s)]
*  I think the kind of key, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2610.1800000000003s)]
*  there are two big key questions to me, and they're related. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2611.78s)]
*  One is how you kind of show Vladimir Putin [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2614.0800000000004s)]
*  that Ukraine and its backers in both the United States [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2617.2999999999997s)]
*  and in Europe are kind of in this for the long haul. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2622.3399999999997s)]
*  So there's, you know, the $60-plus billion assistance package [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2625.18s)]
*  that is starting to flow now is gonna be really important [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2629.4799999999996s)]
*  to, you know, holding off what will probably be [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2631.8799999999997s)]
*  a pretty nasty Russian offensive in the coming months. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2633.8199999999997s)]
*  And it'll be, you know, the kind of first order of business [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2638.9199999999996s)]
*  for Ukrainians obviously will be, you know, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2641.66s)]
*  using that assistance to make sure that they can contain [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2643.62s)]
*  that offense as much as possible. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2646.92s)]
*  I don't think they'll be able to, you know, [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2648.26s)]
*  hold the line everywhere, but to, you know, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2650.86s)]
*  limit Russia's gains in the coming months. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2653.76s)]
*  But then to really send the signal to Putin [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2655.94s)]
*  and to the Russians that, you know, [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2658.2400000000002s)]
*  they can keep spending money on this. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2660.5s)]
*  They can convert their, you know, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2662.44s)]
*  entire economy to a war economy. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2664.2400000000002s)]
*  They just changed the defense minister [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2666.54s)]
*  and put in someone who's, you know, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2668.2400000000002s)]
*  much more focused on the kind of economic sustainability [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2669.62s)]
*  of this, which is, you know, a sign of what they're [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2672.08s)]
*  really gearing up for. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2674.28s)]
*  But really making, you know, making them see that they can [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2676.14s)]
*  continue to throw, you know, additional men. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2680.04s)]
*  They can recruit more prisoners, more, you know, [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2682.04s)]
*  convicted murderers and throw them into Ukraine. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2684.64s)]
*  And that in the long haul, they're [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2688.2799999999997s)]
*  going to be facing the same exact, you know, challenges [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2689.88s)]
*  that they've faced since starting the war, you know, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2694.38s)]
*  more than two years ago now. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2696.62s)]
*  And then the kind of harder question, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2699.06s)]
*  this is I think a hard question for supporters of Ukraine [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2700.66s)]
*  and obviously for Ukrainians is whether they're [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2704.06s)]
*  some kind of, you know, negotiating space [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2705.96s)]
*  that you can get to. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2708.28s)]
*  And we've spent, you know, a lot of time in our pages [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2709.48s)]
*  trying to figure out how you would think [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2713.46s)]
*  about that negotiation, what, you know, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2714.98s)]
*  you might talk about in terms of neutrality and NATO [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2717.82s)]
*  membership and, you know, kind of how you settle the future [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2722.06s)]
*  of Ukrainian territory that's currently [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2725.6s)]
*  occupied by the Russians. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2727.66s)]
*  You know, we don't run those pieces [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2729.5s)]
*  because we think that's going to happen in time soon. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2731.14s)]
*  But ultimately, you know, that's going [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2732.88s)]
*  to become a key question. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2734.72s)]
*  But you can only get there if you make Vladimir Putin [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2736.02s)]
*  and make the Russians understand that there's not [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2739.3599999999997s)]
*  going to be any, you know, kind of quick win [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2742.2999999999997s)]
*  and there's not going to be any slow win, right? [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2744.7999999999997s)]
*  That this is going to be a war that's [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2746.6s)]
*  going to go on for a long time and Ukraine's backers [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2748.64s)]
*  are going to be there. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2750.54s)]
*  And then it's, you know, you have [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2751.94s)]
*  to say that the wild card here is the US election, right? [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2753.48s)]
*  If Donald Trump is elected in November, [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2757.02s)]
*  he said he'll end the war in 24 hours. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2759.3799999999997s)]
*  What he means by that, probably he doesn't even know. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2762.12s)]
*  You know, anyone around him really knows. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2764.28s)]
*  But if you're Putin, you're sitting there, you know, [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2766.28s)]
*  I'd be willing to take the bet that I pulled out [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2771.5600000000004s)]
*  to November, no matter what happens on the battlefield [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2774.36s)]
*  over the coming months and see what you can get out of Trump. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2777.7000000000003s)]
*  So, you know, you really have to get past that [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2780.6600000000003s)]
*  and then show that the Ukrainian and its backers [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2783.34s)]
*  are there for the long haul. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2787.5s)]
*  Yeah, well, we'll see. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2788.6400000000003s)]
*  You're right, the election is, you know, [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2789.84s)]
*  we'll see where we are on the back end of that. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2792.0400000000004s)]
*  One last question for you. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2793.44s)]
*  In Georgia, we've been following this law [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2794.7400000000002s)]
*  that was recently approved by the parliament, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2797.44s)]
*  which requires NGOs and media outlets [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2799.58s)]
*  that receive more than 20% of their funding [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2801.7400000000002s)]
*  from foreign sources to register as, quote, [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2803.6400000000003s)]
*  organizations carrying the interests of a foreign power. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2806.42s)]
*  Now, this may seem, you know, like just a narrow law, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2808.88s)]
*  but it's clearly like kind of a copycat [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2811.98s)]
*  of what the Russians have done as a kind of creeping way [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2813.82s)]
*  to shut down civil society. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2817.12s)]
*  And so rightly, I think people in Georgia [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2818.76s)]
*  see this as a worrying trend towards autocracy [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2822.58s)]
*  and kind of a Russian view of the world. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2825.26s)]
*  Russia obviously occupies big chunks of Georgia already. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2828.62s)]
*  We've seen huge protests in the street, [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2832.86s)]
*  pretty inspiring protests in the street, [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2834.6s)]
*  and clashes with authorities in some cases. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2837.4s)]
*  We're gonna have more on this, I think, in the coming weeks, [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2841.3s)]
*  but just what's your reaction? [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2843.58s)]
*  How should people think about this [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2844.98s)]
*  as they're watching it play out, Dan? [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2846.14s)]
*  I think you're right that this is the kind of law [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2847.24s)]
*  that can sound kind of technical and wonky [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2849.12s)]
*  and not the kind of thing that, given everything happening [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2851.5s)]
*  in Gaza and Ukraine and U.S.-China relationship [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2853.84s)]
*  that people should be paying attention to, [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2856.58s)]
*  but it is exactly the kind of thing that [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2857.92s)]
*  in places from East Asia to Hungary, to Russia itself, [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2861.98s)]
*  it's the kind of law that is both a kind of sign [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2866.86s)]
*  of democratic backsliding and a kind of means [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2870.6s)]
*  by which autocratic figures really entrench [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2873.26s)]
*  that kind of democratic backsliding. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2876.44s)]
*  So it's extremely worrying for Georgia [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2878.2400000000002s)]
*  for that reason and all you, I think, [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2880.7799999999997s)]
*  sympathetic to the constraints here on U.S. policymakers, [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2882.56s)]
*  but there are a lot of denunciations of it [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2886.12s)]
*  from the administration and European governments, [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2888.06s)]
*  but not a lot of response beyond that. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2891.0s)]
*  It's also just worth remembering that this is ultimately [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2893.8999999999996s)]
*  about how Georgia relates to the rest of Europe, [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2898.04s)]
*  and that's about EU membership, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2901.2799999999997s)]
*  it's about how it thinks of itself relating to Russia, [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2903.3799999999997s)]
*  the kind of dominant power to its north and Europe [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2909.34s)]
*  and the West, and I think European Union officials [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2913.44s)]
*  have said this is the kind of thing [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2916.44s)]
*  that would make it very hard to make Georgia [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2918.08s)]
*  part of the European Union. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2920.28s)]
*  I think that in some ways is the real point here. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2921.88s)]
*  This is a chance for Russia [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2925.08s)]
*  and Russia's sympathetic politicians in Georgia [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2926.98s)]
*  to really keep Georgia in its sphere [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2929.42s)]
*  rather than giving it a chance to aspire [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2932.12s)]
*  to kind of European membership. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2935.8s)]
*  And being part of the West, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2937.48s)]
*  and that's ultimately what Ukraine is about, right? [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2938.6800000000003s)]
*  We talk a lot about NATO, [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2940.1800000000003s)]
*  but it's really about whether Ukraine is more [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2942.06s)]
*  kind of European and Western or whether it's in Russia's sphere. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2945.5s)]
*  So it's very much a piece with this broader conflict. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2949.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's interesting. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2952.8s)]
*  If you look along the eastern front [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2954.1s)]
*  of what used to be the Soviet Union, right, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2955.6s)]
*  you've got the Baltics in NATO, in Europe, [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2957.0s)]
*  you've got Belarus pretty much de facto Russian satellite state, [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2959.64s)]
*  Ukraine in a war, Georgia partially occupied [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2964.9s)]
*  and now teetering, and then Armenia, Azerbaijan. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2967.78s)]
*  I mean, it's an interesting mix of fault lines. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2971.78s)]
*  Well, look, Dan, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2975.52s)]
*  Covered a lot of ground. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2977.7200000000003s)]
*  Really loved catching up with you. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2979.32s)]
*  People should check out your book [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2981.02s)]

*  Indy's election campaign is a great one. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2991.6400000000003s)]
*  It's really good to do. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2993.56s)]
*  Indy's elections are currently underway. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2994.86s)]
*  As we talked about on the podcast, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2996.86s)]
*  this is a six-week long enormous undertaking [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=2998.46s)]
*  for the world's largest democracy, [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3001.74s)]
*  although, as we'll talk about India's [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3003.88s)]
*  on something of a spectrum like we are [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3006.14s)]
*  when it comes to being a democracy. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3008.34s)]
*  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of votes [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3010.54s)]
*  are expected to be cast. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3013.2799999999997s)]
*  Perhaps up to 10% of the global population [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3014.98s)]
*  will be voting in this election. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3017.2799999999997s)]
*  The elections are now halfway complete, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3019.36s)]
*  and there's not any suspense about who's going to win. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3021.7999999999997s)]
*  Narendra Modi and his Hindu nationalist BJP party [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3024.98s)]
*  are very much the favorites. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3028.18s)]
*  We wanted to go in depth on this, [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3030.4199999999996s)]
*  the political dynamics in India, [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3032.18s)]
*  the nature of Modi and the BJP today, [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3033.9599999999996s)]
*  and what his continued rule will mean for the world, [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3036.9199999999996s)]
*  for Indians, for minority groups in India, [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3041.02s)]
*  particularly the very large Muslim minority in India. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3043.7999999999997s)]
*  So there is no human being on Earth [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3047.0s)]
*  in a position to give us this perspective [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3049.42s)]
*  than my very good friend Rana Iyab, [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3051.6000000000004s)]
*  an Indian journalist, a columnist for The Washington Post, [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3053.96s)]
*  terrific substack that everybody should check out [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3057.7000000000003s)]
*  and subscribe to. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3059.94s)]
*  Rana is joining us from Mumbai. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3061.1400000000003s)]
*  Rana, it's great to see you. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3062.6000000000004s)]
*  Hey, Ben, good to be back on the show. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3063.6400000000003s)]
*  So, okay, Rana, let's just begin by setting the scene. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3065.3s)]
*  As I just mentioned, this is an enormous undertaking [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3069.08s)]
*  across many weeks. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3071.94s)]
*  There are 15 million people just overseeing the voting. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3073.7200000000003s)]
*  What is it like to be in India [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3078.34s)]
*  just during the process of this election? [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3081.04s)]
*  What does it say about India's democratic culture [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3083.04s)]
*  that, despite all the problems that we'll talk about, [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3087.08s)]
*  the largest election in human history is taking place? [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3090.42s)]
*  Well, Ben, despite the erosion of democracy [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3092.82s)]
*  that we have been witnessing in India in the last 10 years, [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3095.36s)]
*  elections in India are always this justification [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3098.7200000000003s)]
*  where everybody feels like they have a stake in the game [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3102.36s)]
*  and they will be responsible for who comes to power. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3105.7s)]
*  This election, though, has been a particularly long one. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3108.8s)]
*  The announcement was made in February, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3112.16s)]
*  and the election results will be announced in June. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3114.04s)]
*  So the election stretch is across seven phases, [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3116.24s)]
*  across three months. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3118.8s)]
*  So there's a lot that can happen. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3119.84s)]
*  But this particular election, [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3122.88s)]
*  I think Western commentators have expressed their apprehension [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3124.44s)]
*  that this will be the last ever election for India [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3127.92s)]
*  because we have seen the attack on constitutional bodies, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3130.52s)]
*  the attack on democratic values in India. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3134.5s)]
*  But I would begin by saying that there's very little democracy [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3137.0s)]
*  left in this election. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3141.78s)]
*  Everybody calls this the world's largest democracy. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3142.94s)]
*  And this, you know, and Modi is... [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3145.52s)]
*  I mean, my colleagues will disagree with me, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3149.02s)]
*  but I can stick my neck out and say that this is... [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3151.7200000000003s)]
*  I think Modi will win with a good majority in this election. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3154.62s)]
*  I've been traveling across India, including Kashmir, [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3159.76s)]
*  Manipur, northeastern states of India. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3162.0s)]
*  This is not a level playing field. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3164.46s)]
*  This election particularly is not a level playing field [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3166.1s)]
*  because just before the elections, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3168.64s)]
*  the central agencies arrested key opposition leaders, [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3170.84s)]
*  including Arvind Kejriwal, [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3176.14s)]
*  who was seen as a direct opposition [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3177.6800000000003s)]
*  to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3181.2200000000003s)]
*  again, a very cult-like personality, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3182.52s)]
*  somebody who's been crusading against corruption. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3184.6800000000003s)]
*  Central agencies have been allegedly unleashed [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3188.62s)]
*  against almost every dissenter, journalist, opposition leaders. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3191.52s)]
*  We have a mainstream media which looks like it's... [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3196.56s)]
*  Basically, its job is to relay Modi's speeches more so. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3201.34s)]
*  But one of the crucial elements of this election, [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3207.08s)]
*  which I thought, and we all knew it was going to be a lackluster election, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3210.34s)]
*  but it has been made very interesting that Prime Minister Modi has, [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3214.34s)]
*  you know, we know him as this Hindu nationalist [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3218.42s)]
*  who has always cast the Muslims of India, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3221.04s)]
*  the 200 million strong Muslim population of India as the enemy. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3224.48s)]
*  There have been dog whistles in the past. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3228.72s)]
*  His entire career as a Hindu nationalist leader [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3230.36s)]
*  from Gujarat, where he was the chief minister, [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3233.1s)]
*  when a thousand Muslims were killed, [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3234.8s)]
*  to this day has been about Muslims. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3236.5s)]
*  But this particular election, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3238.76s)]
*  we have already crossed the fourth state, [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3240.46s)]
*  the fourth phase of election. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3242.86s)]
*  Every speech by Prime Minister Modi and his council of ministers [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3244.5s)]
*  starts with Muslims and ends with Muslims. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3248.1s)]
*  So the ruling party has put out a video of the BJP [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3251.1s)]
*  that says that if you vote for the Congress party, [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3254.7799999999997s)]
*  your sustenance and everything that belongs to you [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3258.74s)]
*  will go to the average Muslim in the country. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3262.8199999999997s)]
*  The prime minister has referred to Muslims as infiltrators, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3264.8799999999997s)]
*  as child-producing factories, [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3267.8799999999997s)]
*  as people who have intruded in India, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3269.9599999999996s)]
*  as people who are plunderers. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3272.9199999999996s)]
*  He has never used this language in the past. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3275.8199999999997s)]
*  He might have used dog whistles against Muslims [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3277.7599999999998s)]
*  as chief minister of Gujarat, [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3280.96s)]
*  but he has never been more direct in his attack on Muslims [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3282.76s)]
*  the way he has been this time around. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3286.5600000000004s)]
*  He has said that if the opposition comes to power, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3290.3s)]
*  the cricket team will have more Muslims. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3293.98s)]
*  If the opposition, the Congress party comes to power, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3296.38s)]
*  then your right to resources, your electoral right, [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3298.88s)]
*  your places of worship, everything goes to Muslims. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3303.48s)]
*  So this isn't a level playing field [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3305.88s)]
*  because everything is skewed heavily in favor [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3309.42s)]
*  of the Rehender Modi. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3312.1200000000003s)]
*  And the biggest fear is that he is going to fulfill [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3313.42s)]
*  the ambition of Hindu nationalists in India. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3317.92s)]
*  If he gets a third term in power, [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3320.36s)]
*  many fear that he's going to change [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3322.1600000000003s)]
*  the constitution of the country [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3323.7000000000003s)]
*  because the one thing that Hindu nationalists [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3325.0s)]
*  really detest is the idea of democracy, [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3327.1s)]
*  is the idea of secularism. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3329.5s)]
*  And I think that would be altered [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3331.0s)]
*  if Modi gets a third term in power. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3334.04s)]
*  So I definitely want to come back to that, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3335.94s)]
*  but first, just on the election itself, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3338.12s)]
*  the opposition's been somewhat fractured. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3341.2599999999998s)]
*  The Congress party, which governed India for so long, [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3343.94s)]
*  has struggled under Rahul Gandhi, [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3347.14s)]
*  the leader of the party, [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3350.18s)]
*  although he seemed to kind of find some footing [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3351.64s)]
*  in recent years. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3355.7799999999997s)]
*  What is your sense of the state of the opposition? [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3358.58s)]
*  What chance do you think they have in this election? [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3362.7599999999998s)]
*  And the one thing I wanted to ask about, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3365.56s)]
*  some of the analysis I saw, Rana, [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3367.02s)]
*  suggested that Modi was dialing up [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3368.76s)]
*  this anti-Muslim rhetoric in recent days and weeks, [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3371.06s)]
*  in part because perhaps he was worried [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3375.7s)]
*  that the BJP was underperforming in parts of the country. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3379.04s)]
*  And so he's turning out his voters [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3382.9s)]
*  with this kind of bloodthirsty rhetoric. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3385.04s)]
*  I mean, how do you assess the opposition's chances? [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3387.04s)]
*  And how would you describe for people [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3389.54s)]
*  who don't follow this closely [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3391.54s)]
*  kind of what the state of the Congress party is? [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3392.88s)]
*  You know, to be fair, I mean, I've also been critical [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3394.74s)]
*  of the way the opposition has conducted itself [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3397.04s)]
*  over the last 10 years. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3399.42s)]
*  But to be fair to the Indian opposition, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3401.8199999999997s)]
*  especially the Congress party, [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3404.3599999999997s)]
*  with the odd stand-heavenly against them, [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3406.12s)]
*  and not just the Congress party, [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3408.16s)]
*  but other, the India alliance, [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3409.62s)]
*  in which there's an umbrella group [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3411.1s)]
*  of opposition parties that have come together. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3412.66s)]
*  With each one of their leaders being arrested [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3414.94s)]
*  or being co-opted, [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3417.1s)]
*  if some opposition leader has a political opinion, [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3419.5s)]
*  if some opposition leader has a corruption case [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3422.52s)]
*  and he joins the BJP, immediately his sins are washed. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3425.46s)]
*  So the way the odds are heavily stacked against them, [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3428.46s)]
*  they don't have the finances, [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3431.06s)]
*  they don't have the money power. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3432.06s)]
*  But still, I think in the last two weeks, [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3433.66s)]
*  the Congress party, with the way it has put this advertisement, [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3435.64s)]
*  the way Rahul Gandhi has been going, [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3438.4s)]
*  all about the Adani Ambani, [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3439.94s)]
*  the crony capitalism in India, [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3442.2400000000002s)]
*  the way he is consistently attacking unemployment in India. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3444.2400000000002s)]
*  He is not, he's not sitting ground to, [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3447.78s)]
*  Modi wants this entire election to be polarized [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3450.2599999999998s)]
*  on the basis of Hindus and Muslims. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3452.72s)]
*  But to give credit to the opposition, [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3454.62s)]
*  they have been very consistent [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3457.16s)]
*  in talking about unemployment and inflation. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3458.66s)]
*  But had I said that, and I agree that, [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3461.2599999999998s)]
*  and I agree that Prime Minister Modi is talking this, [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3463.16s)]
*  this Hindu-Muslim polarization, [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3466.6s)]
*  this anti-Muslim bigotry, [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3468.7999999999997s)]
*  because there is a sense of disenchantment on the ground, [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3470.14s)]
*  that there are people who genuinely do not have jobs, [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3474.04s)]
*  that there be this genuine anger on the ground [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3476.64s)]
*  because there is inflation. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3479.02s)]
*  But at the end of the day, Modi is also speaking a language [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3481.32s)]
*  that is acceptable to a larger section of the Indian Republic. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3484.6s)]
*  This is an average Hindu voter [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3489.6s)]
*  who has been made to feel like a victim in his own country. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3492.84s)]
*  He's been told that ideas like democracy [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3497.28s)]
*  are being weaponized against the average Hindu, [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3499.88s)]
*  and he has found figures. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3502.54s)]
*  For instance, Modi's inauguration [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3503.78s)]
*  of the Ram Temple in January, [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3506.22s)]
*  January 2022 at a Ram Temple [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3508.5s)]
*  which was built over a demolished mosque. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3510.7200000000003s)]
*  And I had just left India, [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3514.5s)]
*  and I came back around Republic Day. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3517.04s)]
*  And I have seen, I've never seen that site in India [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3519.4s)]
*  where on Republic Day, we normally have national flags [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3522.08s)]
*  in every Indian household. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3524.28s)]
*  This time we had the saffron flag everywhere. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3525.78s)]
*  And it's ironic that there are certain Muslim families [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3528.04s)]
*  who decided to post the national flag in the tricolor, [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3532.98s)]
*  and they were tickled for not posting the saffron flag. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3535.2799999999997s)]
*  So there is this public wave, [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3540.68s)]
*  and there are these well-being, [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3543.2799999999997s)]
*  including these well-being people who believe [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3544.8599999999997s)]
*  that Modi is finally realizing the dream of a Hindu India. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3546.98s)]
*  And this is not like a small population. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3551.8599999999997s)]
*  I have friends who are Ivy League grass, [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3554.2s)]
*  and we are on WhatsApp groups. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3557.46s)]
*  And some of them have these well-being conversations [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3558.8999999999996s)]
*  where they say that Muslims are so many countries. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3561.44s)]
*  We Hindus have just one Hindu nation. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3563.62s)]
*  Why can't Prime Minister Modi lead us to that? [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3565.86s)]
*  So I think that it is, I mean, yes, Modi is dialing up [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3568.5s)]
*  because, yes, he has failed to deliver on unemployment. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3571.94s)]
*  Yes, there is a great deal of propaganda, [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3574.8399999999997s)]
*  but all the propaganda has managed to stick [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3578.0s)]
*  with the average Indian, [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3580.04s)]
*  because he has successfully managed to cast [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3581.54s)]
*  the 200 million Muslims as the enemy [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3583.98s)]
*  of the Hindu success, of Hindu progress in India. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3586.8199999999997s)]
*  You know, constantly dialing up the Mughal invasion, [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3589.7799999999997s)]
*  constantly dialing up about, you know, [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3593.24s)]
*  talking about issues like, for instance, [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3595.18s)]
*  just about a week ago, the Prime Minister's internal, [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3598.18s)]
*  his own department, his own ministry, [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3602.3199999999997s)]
*  has released a population report, which is so skewed, [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3604.72s)]
*  but he says that Muslim population is increasing [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3608.22s)]
*  and Hindu population is decreasing. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3610.3199999999997s)]
*  Now, by the time a report like that is fact-checked, [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3612.2999999999997s)]
*  that report has reached the average Indian, [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3615.0s)]
*  and they actually genuinely believe that this is the case, [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3617.4s)]
*  and we need somebody like Modi to stop this kind [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3620.98s)]
*  of Muslim implosion in India. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3623.6600000000003s)]
*  And that's what Modi's campaign has been about. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3625.2200000000003s)]
*  And I don't think, I mean, I have spoken to people [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3628.06s)]
*  on the ground, and these are people who are suffering, [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3631.26s)]
*  and these are people I have met who say that, [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3633.7000000000003s)]
*  oh, they have not had jobs, and they have, you know, [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3636.1s)]
*  they have taken loans, [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3639.0s)]
*  and they are unable to repay their loans. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3640.94s)]
*  And then in the same breath, some of them have told me, [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3642.48s)]
*  but at the end of the day, [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3644.98s)]
*  he has got Lord Ram back in India. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3646.48s)]
*  He has got Lord Ram's respectability [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3649.0s)]
*  by building this Hindu temple, [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3651.54s)]
*  which liberals have not allowed us to have in our own galaxy. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3653.64s)]
*  So he has, in a way, weaponized that, [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3658.88s)]
*  and he has successfully used that in this election. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3661.32s)]
*  A lot of my critics believe that Ram temple is not an issue, [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3664.6800000000003s)]
*  that Hindu Muslim is not an issue. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3667.56s)]
*  I think it's a very, very crucial issue, this election. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3669.42s)]
*  And that's the only way Modi knows how to win elections. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3672.06s)]
*  If you see his entire career trajectory from 2002 [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3674.3s)]
*  when he was a Gujarat Chief Minister to this day, [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3677.68s)]
*  the only way he has won an election [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3681.18s)]
*  is by bringing in the Muslim card. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3684.52s)]
*  When 9-11 terror attacks happened, [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3686.72s)]
*  I mean, now, of course, Modi does not come on television TV. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3689.2599999999998s)]
*  He has not taken a single press conference in 10 years. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3691.7599999999998s)]
*  And I remember when 9-11 happened, [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3694.6s)]
*  he went to a television TV or any TV [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3696.2599999999998s)]
*  where he cherry-picked verses from the Koran [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3698.54s)]
*  and alluded that Muslims are terrorists [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3701.54s)]
*  and Muslims are terrorist inclinations. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3704.4s)]
*  So this is what Modi's politics is all about, [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3707.3799999999997s)]
*  and this is why he was elected to power, not despite it. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3709.62s)]
*  He was elected to power because of the Hindu nationalism [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3712.52s)]
*  that he is, and to kind of fulfill [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3716.46s)]
*  the dream of a Hindu India. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3718.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's interesting how [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3719.96s)]
*  it's a Hindu nationalist flavor of a kind of ethno-nationalism [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3724.3599999999997s)]
*  we're seeing around the world, right? [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3730.24s)]
*  Make India great again. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3731.9s)]
*  But I mean, for people who are interested, [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3734.44s)]
*  you did a great podcast with me, [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3736.48s)]
*  Missing America, in the background, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3738.04s)]
*  but essentially, the BJP, the Hindu Nationalist Party, [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3739.44s)]
*  has roots in kind of pre-World War II, [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3741.92s)]
*  literally, fascism, the RSS, the origin group [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3744.62s)]
*  that led to the BJP espousing a Hindu nationalist vision [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3748.02s)]
*  for the country rather than the kind of pluralistic vision [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3754.46s)]
*  that Mahatma Gandhi and Nehru and India's founding generation [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3759.44s)]
*  chose. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3763.44s)]
*  So here we are at this kind of decisive point [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3765.06s)]
*  where Modi is consolidated power. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3768.1s)]
*  He looks like he's poised to win another significant majority. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3770.2000000000003s)]
*  Looking ahead to a third Modi term, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3775.14s)]
*  and we'll start inside of India, and then the next question, [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3778.42s)]
*  I'll go global. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3780.7200000000003s)]
*  But what is the scenario that, what [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3782.7200000000003s)]
*  do you think a third Modi term will be like? [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3786.48s)]
*  How far could he go in kind of transforming India [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3789.32s)]
*  into a Hindu national state? [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3793.46s)]
*  What does that mean for Indian democracy? [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3794.86s)]
*  What does it mean for the 200 million Muslim minority [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3797.1600000000003s)]
*  population inside of India? [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3801.1s)]
*  With the 200 million Muslim population, [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3803.84s)]
*  just, I mean, literally on the day of Eid, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3805.9s)]
*  on the day of Ramadan, on the day Ramadan began in India, [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3808.78s)]
*  India notified the Citizenship Act. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3813.48s)]
*  Now, this act gives citizenship to all persecuted minorities [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3816.02s)]
*  in Asia except Muslims. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3820.06s)]
*  Now, this, when you combine it with the National [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3822.34s)]
*  Register of Citizens, Muslims will [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3824.98s)]
*  have to prove their citizenship in India, [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3827.6800000000003s)]
*  which also means that poor Muslims on the borders [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3830.26s)]
*  of, in the bordering villages of Bangladesh [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3835.06s)]
*  might not have their papers. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3837.4s)]
*  There are detention camps being built for them. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3839.4s)]
*  I mean, Chief Minister of those states [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3841.86s)]
*  has clearly said that we are going [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3844.2400000000002s)]
*  to throw these migrants and these termites [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3846.2000000000003s)]
*  to where they belong. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3849.84s)]
*  They termites us, of course, as the opposite for Muslims. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3850.7599999999998s)]
*  So I think there's going to be a very, very difficult time [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3853.9599999999996s)]
*  for the average Indian Muslim. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3859.14s)]
*  A lot of Muslims that I'm talking to, [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3860.7799999999997s)]
*  I mean, the privileged Muslims, of course, [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3862.54s)]
*  want to leave India because they have [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3864.18s)]
*  the privilege of leaving India because they believe it's [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3865.68s)]
*  unbearable to stay in the country right now. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3868.8399999999997s)]
*  But what happens to, I mean, amongst the 200 million [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3870.62s)]
*  Muslim population in India, a majority of them [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3873.4199999999996s)]
*  are in, you know, are from the backward class and caste, [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3875.8799999999997s)]
*  right? [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3880.14s)]
*  They can't afford to leave the country. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3881.62s)]
*  And the number of lynchings that have happened, [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3883.22s)]
*  hate crimes against Muslims that have taken place [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3885.7599999999998s)]
*  in the last 10 years of the Modi government, [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3887.88s)]
*  hate speeches against Muslims, life streaming of hate crimes. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3890.12s)]
*  Muslims are being lynched on the acquisition of eating beef. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3893.52s)]
*  And that act is live streamed on YouTube. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3896.2999999999997s)]
*  And, you know, you have Muslim, you have BJP candidates [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3898.96s)]
*  for this election as we are voting, [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3904.14s)]
*  going in front of a mosque and, in a way, [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3906.14s)]
*  demonstrating that they're going to target it again. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3909.34s)]
*  I think this election is not just a challenge [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3911.82s)]
*  for the average Indian Muslim, and it's also a challenge [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3914.36s)]
*  for civil society in it. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3917.32s)]
*  You know, we then, Freedom House, [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3918.96s)]
*  have already denigrated India from a democracy [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3920.6000000000004s)]
*  to an electoral autocracy. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3923.46s)]
*  World Press Freedom Index, we are in the 161st position. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3925.96s)]
*  Civil society has almost been decimated. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3929.94s)]
*  You know, any, most of the civil society groups [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3932.44s)]
*  have been, I mean, very, very Victor Urbanish, [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3934.6400000000003s)]
*  called as Soros-funded publications, [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3938.26s)]
*  which are out there to discredit India. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3940.96s)]
*  Some of India's finest student rights activists [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3943.1600000000003s)]
*  are behind bars under terror charges. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3945.6600000000003s)]
*  So you have effectively silenced the people [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3948.6400000000003s)]
*  who were, who would have made a difference, [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3951.5s)]
*  would have acted as bulwarks against this authoritarianism. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3954.04s)]
*  And on the ground, you have people who are Modi supporters, [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3958.1800000000003s)]
*  who might not even be Modi supporters, [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3962.42s)]
*  who believe that Modi has increased, or in a way, [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3964.16s)]
*  increased India's stature globally, [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3968.3599999999997s)]
*  with Joe Biden giving him, you know, [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3970.3599999999997s)]
*  the state honor and the world kind of feeding him. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3972.5s)]
*  I believe that a third term for Modi would mean that [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3976.2s)]
*  it's gonna give him a blank check to basically [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3980.24s)]
*  do anything that he wants with the Constitution, [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3988.38s)]
*  with the institutions, with the opposition, [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3990.7799999999997s)]
*  with journalists, with dissenters, [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3992.94s)]
*  with absolutely no pushback from the national community, [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3995.04s)]
*  because he has tested waters. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3998.32s)]
*  I mean, we have seen over the last couple of months [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=3999.96s)]
*  what happened with the class national killing [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4002.62s)]
*  of Sikh separatists in America. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4004.26s)]
*  He knows that there's gonna be no pushback. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4006.76s)]
*  And in absence of any pressure, [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4009.16s)]
*  and he has already cast all human rights groups [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4011.1s)]
*  as enemies of the country. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4013.96s)]
*  So I think the world's largest democracy [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4016.14s)]
*  is gonna be a democracy only on paper. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4018.68s)]
*  So I think we will still have elections, [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4021.02s)]
*  you know, the way Putin does elections in Russia, [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4023.5s)]
*  we will still continue to have elections, [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4025.56s)]
*  but it's gonna be just elections on paper. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4027.3s)]
*  Even this particular election, I think it's, [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4029.84s)]
*  we have the Election Commission of India, [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4033.34s)]
*  which is supposed to moderate and implement [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4035.28s)]
*  the model of vote of conduct. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4038.32s)]
*  But the Prime Minister calling Muslims [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4039.88s)]
*  child-producing factories at an election rally, [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4043.78s)]
*  and the Election Commission of India looks the other way. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4046.82s)]
*  There are voters, Muslim voters, [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4049.62s)]
*  who are not being allowed to cast their vote, [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4051.36s)]
*  and the Election Commission does not interfere. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4053.4s)]
*  The Election Commission, on the contrary, [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4055.64s)]
*  sends notices to the opposition leaders. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4057.7s)]
*  So almost every body, constitutional body, [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4060.16s)]
*  that is meant to protect the Indian democracy [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4066.14s)]
*  has been decimated. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4068.68s)]
*  So I can only fear the worst in the third term. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4069.7799999999997s)]
*  I mean, how much more worse can it get? [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4072.2799999999997s)]
*  But I feel like we are looking at the worst [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4074.22s)]
*  ever for Indian history in a third term of Modi. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4077.5s)]
*  So I want to ask you about this kind of global perspective, [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4080.14s)]
*  right, because you're familiar with it. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4083.18s)]
*  Essentially, I'll go through a few different [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4084.84s)]
*  external viewpoints of India that essentially try to see [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4088.08s)]
*  a different Modi from the outside, right? [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4093.38s)]
*  You have, I think, a global kind of business community, [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4096.02s)]
*  markets that see India as some potential alternative to China [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4099.86s)]
*  in terms of places to make investments, [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4104.66s)]
*  and places, well, to make money or to make things. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4106.48s)]
*  Then you have a global Indian diaspora, many of whom [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4111.219999999999s)]
*  are small-D democratic type people who are proud of Modi [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4115.759999999999s)]
*  and proud of the way in which he's become a global figure, [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4121.74s)]
*  and India's prestige is up. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4127.28s)]
*  And then lastly, as you said, you [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4130.179999999999s)]
*  have the United States, which has very much courted Modi. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4131.54s)]
*  President Biden had a state visit for him. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4136.48s)]
*  It came out, frankly, that during that state visit, [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4139.98s)]
*  there was a plot uncovered to assassinate a sick person [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4142.5599999999995s)]
*  in the United States. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4148.299999999999s)]
*  So you see all this projection onto Modi. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4150.94s)]
*  He's a Democrat. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4154.599999999999s)]
*  He's in the small-D democratic team. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4155.54s)]
*  He's part of our China strategy, or this [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4158.28s)]
*  is a place to do business. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4160.48s)]
*  Or we're Indian Americans, and we're [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4162.679999999999s)]
*  proud of Modi's stature in the world. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4165.0599999999995s)]
*  How do you respond to that kind of view from the outside? [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4170.2s)]
*  I know you've come to Washington. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4174.44s)]
*  You've met with US government officials. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4175.839999999999s)]
*  What is your message when you try [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4177.74s)]
*  to talk to those constituencies? [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4179.04s)]
*  Everybody that I talk to, including [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4181.24s)]
*  people in the White House and the State Department [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4184.24s)]
*  over the last couple of years, I think [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4186.58s)]
*  they have been very, very clear and categoric [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4188.179999999999s)]
*  that they are alarmed at the attack on the Muslim minorities, [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4190.46s)]
*  the attack on democratic institutions. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4196.26s)]
*  So the US State Department will place [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4197.96s)]
*  its religious freedom report just before Modi goes to the US [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4199.96s)]
*  for a state visit. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4203.36s)]
*  So it's not that America is less aware, [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4204.54s)]
*  but at the end of the day, strategic relationships [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4207.6s)]
*  triumph all these shared values and constitutions [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4211.0s)]
*  that you talk about democracy. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4213.5s)]
*  And at the end of the day, that's [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4215.34s)]
*  what Biden administration that's, I mean, [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4217.54s)]
*  that's what Gaza has in a way. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4219.88s)]
*  It's going to be revealed what, at the end of the day, [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4222.18s)]
*  human rights and democracy can be trumpeted [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4224.58s)]
*  when it comes to strategic interests. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4227.08s)]
*  And what really is, you're talking [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4229.66s)]
*  about creating a bulwark against China, [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4232.7s)]
*  a democratic counterweight to China. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4235.900000000001s)]
*  But at the end of the day, what you're not realizing [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4237.86s)]
*  is that in the process, you are creating [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4239.86s)]
*  another Xi Jinping or Putin right now. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4242.06s)]
*  Because this leader has the same tendencies, [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4244.88s)]
*  but you're not extending the same criticism [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4247.36s)]
*  that you do with Putin or Xi to Modi. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4250.099999999999s)]
*  Because, you know, you at this point of time, [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4252.74s)]
*  the United States needs Modi. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4254.799999999999s)]
*  But as far as the diaspora is concerned, [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4256.7s)]
*  I think the diaspora has been one of Modi's [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4259.339999999999s)]
*  biggest supporters, even during the 2002 [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4261.24s)]
*  Gujrat riots, after which the United States [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4263.42s)]
*  did not even visa-train to the country. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4265.179999999999s)]
*  It was a diaspora which, of course, [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4267.639999999999s)]
*  played a very significant role. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4269.12s)]
*  It has been drumming up crowds of Modi all over the US. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4270.48s)]
*  But I don't think the US can really tell India [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4275.28s)]
*  what to do, and I mean, but to roll out [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4279.88s)]
*  the red carpet the way it did with Modi, [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4285.28s)]
*  despite being aware, I mean, a Washington Post report [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4288.36s)]
*  that came out last week recently revealed [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4291.599999999999s)]
*  that the US government reached out to India [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4293.5599999999995s)]
*  and told them, alerted them about the Washington Post [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4295.46s)]
*  investigation. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4297.74s)]
*  I feel that this US regime has been [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4299.84s)]
*  pretty hypocritical when it comes to dealing with India. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4303.92s)]
*  And Modi has two different projections. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4307.06s)]
*  He has two different faces. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4310.400000000001s)]
*  When he goes abroad, he goes to the United Nations. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4311.7s)]
*  He prostrates before Gandhi. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4313.9400000000005s)]
*  He will talk about democracy. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4316.5s)]
*  I think the only question he has ever [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4317.88s)]
*  answered on international soil was in this joint press [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4319.52s)]
*  conference with Biden, where he repeated the word democracy [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4322.9800000000005s)]
*  about 30 times in one answer, right? [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4326.28s)]
*  I mean, it was the only time you get to see Modi use the word [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4328.66s)]
*  democracy, and it's the only time you get to see Modi talk [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4332.74s)]
*  about Gandhi, because back home, his assassins [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4335.18s)]
*  are being celebrated. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4338.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, Gandhi's assassins, yeah. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4339.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it is at this point of time, [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4341.0199999999995s)]
*  it is not the Gandhi ideology or the Nehru ideology [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4342.96s)]
*  with kind of Modi as spouses in the West. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4347.96s)]
*  At this point of time, it is the ideology of Nathuram Gursi, [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4349.9s)]
*  who assassinated the Mahatma, which is running the country. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4353.2s)]
*  And the US is well aware of this. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4356.099999999999s)]
*  I don't need to tell the US what's happening in India. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4357.74s)]
*  Nobody needs to tell the US what's happening in India. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4359.58s)]
*  There are the diplomats here who are being, [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4361.76s)]
*  who are well aware about the situation here. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4364.84s)]
*  I do believe that America, President Joe Biden has been, [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4371.08s)]
*  and his administration has been pretty hypocritical [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4376.740000000001s)]
*  when it comes to dealing with Prime Minister Modi, in a way, [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4379.820000000001s)]
*  enabled him. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4382.02s)]
*  In a way, enabled him, and he believes that now he [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4383.58s)]
*  has a blank check, because the US needs him vis-a-vis Russia [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4386.22s)]
*  and China. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4389.860000000001s)]
*  He needs a blank check to go about and committing [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4390.84s)]
*  any forms of excesses that he might want. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4393.820000000001s)]
*  I mean, I was watching Jayashankar's interview [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4396.18s)]
*  yesterday, I think. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4398.38s)]
*  He spoke about that we might not have a traditional alliance [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4399.88s)]
*  with the US, but I sat down and convinced [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4403.46s)]
*  why it was important for us to buy Russian oil, [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4406.22s)]
*  and they were convinced. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4408.5s)]
*  So these are the conversations that Jayashankar is having. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4409.7s)]
*  He's trying to convince the world that Indian foreign [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4413.06s)]
*  policy has managed to teach America what it feels like to have [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4416.1s)]
*  allies, and you know that better more than anybody is. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4420.1s)]
*  Also, I don't think, Ben, that this government, [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4422.86s)]
*  the Biden administration, is any different from the Obama [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4425.8s)]
*  administration. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4428.8s)]
*  I could be wrong here, but when he visited the United States [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4429.9s)]
*  for the first time in 2014, this was right after. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4433.74s)]
*  It was the first time he was entering the United States [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4436.58s)]
*  after he was barred from entering the country, [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4438.78s)]
*  and everybody knew his detracted human rights. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4440.48s)]
*  He has always used the US card, that acceptability in the US, [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4443.58s)]
*  back home in the country to go to the borders. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4447.76s)]
*  No, you're right. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4450.26s)]
*  We've talked about this over the years. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4451.5s)]
*  I mean, the Obama administration, [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4452.860000000001s)]
*  like the Biden administration, wanted other things from Modi, [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4455.0s)]
*  wanted the Paris climate deal, wanted support for China policy. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4458.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean, Obama did speak more about democratic values [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4462.7s)]
*  in India, and Joe Biden hasn't been to India, [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4466.9400000000005s)]
*  but your point is absolutely correct. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4468.820000000001s)]
*  I do want to ask you, speaking of American hypocrisy, [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4473.4800000000005s)]
*  about Gaza, you've been quite, you know, [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4477.06s)]
*  spoken about Gaza. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4479.26s)]
*  And for people who haven't followed this, [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4481.26s)]
*  there's an interesting kind of bromance [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4482.96s)]
*  that over the years between Modi and Netanyahu, [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4484.8s)]
*  Gaza, pro-Palestinian, or just protest of the Israeli war [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4489.0s)]
*  in Gaza and India have been met with crackdowns at times. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4494.38s)]
*  We, Modi was the first Indian prime minister [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4499.620000000001s)]
*  to visit Israel back in 2017. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4503.320000000001s)]
*  After October 7th, when Israel revoked work permits [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4506.18s)]
*  from a significant number of Palestinians, [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4510.42s)]
*  they kind of asked for Indian workers to come replace them. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4512.46s)]
*  So there's this kind of strange affinity, or not strange, [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4518.7s)]
*  there's this affinity between Modi and Netanyahu. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4523.16s)]
*  I just wanted to ask you about that relationship [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4529.099999999999s)]
*  and what the dynamic is like [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4531.94s)]
*  in terms of the Indian government's approach to Gaza [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4535.76s)]
*  and kind of what you're seeing as someone [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4539.94s)]
*  who's obviously concerned about [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4542.3s)]
*  the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4545.44s)]
*  How does this, how does Gaza, [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4548.34s)]
*  how does Gaza kind of play out in Indian politics? [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4553.04s)]
*  So there are two projections again here. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4556.08s)]
*  You know, when Jayashankar talks about Gaza, [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4558.08s)]
*  when Indian representatives talk about Gaza at the UN, [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4560.219999999999s)]
*  they talk about a two-state solution, [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4563.12s)]
*  they support the vote for Palestinian rights [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4564.64s)]
*  to be elected to be a permanent member of the UN. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4566.74s)]
*  But at the same time, on the 7th of October, [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4570.14s)]
*  when the beach trip, we put out a tweet that said that, [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4572.62s)]
*  this could have happened in India, three worthy years. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4578.96s)]
*  So we have awarded what is happening in Israel. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4582.82s)]
*  We have awarded that from happening to Indian Indians. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4586.0s)]
*  So Indian-Hindu nationalists have a very, [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4589.8s)]
*  very strange affiliation and strange love for Zionism, [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4592.82s)]
*  especially because their ideological, [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4600.2s)]
*  you know, their ideological inspiration [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4603.0s)]
*  have been the Nazis. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4605.639999999999s)]
*  The RSS draws its ideological support from the Nazis. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4606.84s)]
*  So you have a lot of these Twitter handles on, [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4610.08s)]
*  on, you know, Hindu nationalist Twitter handles [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4612.84s)]
*  which are often followed by the Prime Minister [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4616.58s)]
*  who have Hitler as the display picture. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4619.12s)]
*  And we're talking about teaching Palestinians their place [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4621.080000000001s)]
*  and what Netanyahu is doing is the right thing to do. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4623.52s)]
*  So I think it is, it stems from this, you know, [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4625.72s)]
*  this desire of, this supremacist desire [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4629.26s)]
*  that a lot of Hindu nationalists believe that Netanyahu, [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4631.96s)]
*  P.B. Netanyahu is probably the only man who has figured [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4635.900000000001s)]
*  how to show Muslims their place [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4640.06s)]
*  and how to establish supremacy in their country. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4642.04s)]
*  I mean, Indians, Indians, Indian-Hindu nationalists [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4645.34s)]
*  are fanboys of P.B. Netanyahu. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4647.580000000001s)]
*  On the day October 7 happened, [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4649.42s)]
*  Israeli has been found with people in Gaza. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4651.16s)]
*  The worst kind of hate against people of Gaza [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4653.76s)]
*  has been emanating from Indian Twitter. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4656.0s)]
*  As far as India, as far as the Maldives, [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4659.24s)]
*  Netanyahu romance is concerned, [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4661.2s)]
*  India is the biggest importer [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4662.68s)]
*  of Israeli military weapons and surveillance. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4664.54s)]
*  And, you know, it was the hardest report two days ago [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4667.78s)]
*  that we are the biggest importers [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4670.52s)]
*  of military equipment and surveillance. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4673.02s)]
*  So I think in that sense, there's a bit of a bonhomie, [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4676.74s)]
*  there's quite a bit of a bonhomie between India and Israel [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4680.08s)]
*  on an unofficial level. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4684.82s)]
*  On an official level, of course, [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4686.36s)]
*  it is India's stated position that we endorse [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4687.46s)]
*  in two states, the state, two states. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4689.86s)]
*  One is the city, we care for people in Gaza, [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4692.099999999999s)]
*  but at the end of the day, the Hindu nationalist project [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4697.3s)]
*  really believes in P.B. Netanyahu's idea of supremacy [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4701.139999999999s)]
*  because this Indian internationalist project [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4704.18s)]
*  that we are practicing here, [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4706.3s)]
*  it derives its inspiration from the state of Israel, [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4707.84s)]
*  which is why you see this kind of romance [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4710.6s)]
*  between the two leaders, [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4712.240000000001s)]
*  and just why, in fact, all the leaders, [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4714.4800000000005s)]
*  many leaders of Modi might not be saying it, [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4717.4800000000005s)]
*  but leaders of the BJP have publicly endorsed [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4720.780000000001s)]
*  what Netanyahu was doing. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4724.12s)]
*  Election videos in this election have shown [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4725.42s)]
*  that what is happening in Israel could happen in India [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4729.16s)]
*  if Modi's not elected to power. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4731.42s)]
*  That's the kind of dynamic that both the Zionists [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4732.94s)]
*  and the Hindu nationalists share when it comes to supremacy. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4737.08s)]
*  I mean, that is really interesting. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4740.92s)]
*  There's so much happening there. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4743.259999999999s)]
*  There's so many layers there, right? [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4744.599999999999s)]
*  Because India has this kind of post-colonial solidarity [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4745.86s)]
*  over the years with the Palestinian cause, [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4749.46s)]
*  but then now this kind of supremacist solidarity [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4751.5599999999995s)]
*  and anti-Muslim, that's fascinating. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4754.0s)]
*  All right, I want to ask you one last question, [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4757.599999999999s)]
*  which is about journalism. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4760.28s)]
*  You are, I think, people listening to this, I'm sure, [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4761.96s)]
*  are wondering, wow, what's it like to be a journalist in India [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4766.84s)]
*  who's critical of the Modi government, who's a Muslim? [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4771.08s)]
*  You've also been an outspoken proponent [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4776.28s)]
*  of kind of press freedom globally, [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4777.9800000000005s)]
*  I think really one of the leading global journalists [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4780.38s)]
*  along with people like Maria Race in the Philippines [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4782.42s)]
*  on behalf of the rights of journalism. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4784.56s)]
*  Just I want to ask you, what's it like being a journalist [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4787.36s)]
*  in India today? [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4790.1s)]
*  And how do you kind of connect your own continued insistence [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4791.74s)]
*  on your work and being in India with the kind of value [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4795.68s)]
*  of press freedom that is under attack globally? [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4799.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, just to give you an anecdote, [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4802.0199999999995s)]
*  when the elections began a week before the Indian elections, [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4803.16s)]
*  I got seven income tax notices on a demand notice [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4805.92s)]
*  for $300,000, and I wasn't the only one. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4808.36s)]
*  I reached out to a couple of people, [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4810.96s)]
*  a couple of other editors, and both received these notices. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4812.16s)]
*  So basically, between fighting my defamation cases, [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4815.0599999999995s)]
*  my income tax cases, my money laundering cases, [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4818.78s)]
*  by the time I come back, there's obviously [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4820.8s)]
*  an energy left for doing journalism. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4822.34s)]
*  But having said that, I think I'm far more privileged. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4824.139999999999s)]
*  I've just returned from Kashmir, [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4826.139999999999s)]
*  the largest Muslim majority state in India, [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4829.74s)]
*  which is the most militarized zone in the world. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4832.84s)]
*  And I spoke with journalists there. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4834.92s)]
*  Kashmiri journalists have been detained, jailed, [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4837.32s)]
*  their passports impounded for just reporting the truth. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4841.5199999999995s)]
*  And Indian journalism is, I think, [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4844.5599999999995s)]
*  Indian mainstream journalism's as good as dead. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4847.7s)]
*  We have 100,000 newspapers. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4850.02s)]
*  We have about 400 news channels. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4852.12s)]
*  But the kind of attack that Indian press has seen [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4854.12s)]
*  over the last 10 years is unprecedented. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4858.52s)]
*  Two months ago, the Enforcement Direct paid attack, [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4861.2s)]
*  or raided at least 40 journalists. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4864.6s)]
*  And the head of the news organization [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4867.9s)]
*  was slapped money laundering charges. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4870.1s)]
*  Journalists in Kashmir are slapped by tenors of charges. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4871.84s)]
*  And more importantly, I think there's a distinction [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4875.18s)]
*  that I want to make here, that earlier, I mean, [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4877.38s)]
*  we have all been writing for international publications. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4879.36s)]
*  But never before was there this pressure [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4881.8s)]
*  that if I write for an international publication, [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4883.94s)]
*  I'm bringing this repute to India. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4886.5s)]
*  I can write an Indian publication, [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4888.74s)]
*  but I should not write critical pieces [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4890.84s)]
*  about Indian media in international publications, [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4893.62s)]
*  because Modi has successfully managed to conflate [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4898.42s)]
*  any criticism of Modi with criticism of India. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4901.42s)]
*  Like any article in the New York Times [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4904.66s)]
*  or the Washington Post is seen as an attack [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4906.32s)]
*  on the sovereignty of India. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4907.82s)]
*  Foreign journalists, foreign correspondents in India [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4909.36s)]
*  have issued so many statements. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4911.0599999999995s)]
*  ABC journalists in India was forced to leave last week [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4912.96s)]
*  following a documentary that shared a niger. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4915.74s)]
*  A friend journalist who lived in India for 23 years [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4918.24s)]
*  was forced to leave last year, [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4921.44s)]
*  despite having lived here for two decades of her life. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4923.38s)]
*  I think it's just a challenge right now, [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4926.34s)]
*  especially for so many of us who write [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4928.12s)]
*  for international publications, because the country [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4929.38s)]
*  has largely started seeing us as journalists [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4932.48s)]
*  who are selling India's sovereignty [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4934.98s)]
*  to the Western white world. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4937.36s)]
*  And in India, we don't have the platforms [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4939.66s)]
*  to tell those stories. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4941.5599999999995s)]
*  But kudos to a lot of young journalists [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4942.86s)]
*  who are using YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Reels, [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4945.2s)]
*  like journalist Nika Hossar, or their stories. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4949.0s)]
*  So I think in that sense, there is a pushback. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4951.54s)]
*  But in effect, I feel that mainstream journalism houses [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4955.139999999999s)]
*  have been the biggest letdown. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4959.099999999999s)]
*  When we are not fighting cases, [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4961.38s)]
*  we are being discriminated on social media. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4964.12s)]
*  And largely, when I go out on the field [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4967.5199999999995s)]
*  and I tell people that I'm reporting, [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4970.12s)]
*  and I tell them I'm from the Washington Post, [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4971.62s)]
*  they don't want to talk, [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4972.9s)]
*  because they see me as the enemy of the state. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4974.0599999999995s)]
*  So you're either discriminating me with multiple cases, [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4976.4s)]
*  assaulting me because I'm a Muslim journalist. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4980.04s)]
*  You're labeling me as a Muslim [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4982.3s)]
*  who has an agenda against India, and then you have these cases. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4984.2s)]
*  So I think I'm in a very privileged position [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4987.04s)]
*  as compared to the many journalists in India [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4989.58s)]
*  who are stagnating behind bars with absolutely YouTube error [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4992.68s)]
*  in their case. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4996.9800000000005s)]
*  So in that sense, I am privileged, [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4997.9800000000005s)]
*  but again, it's a big price to pay for so many of us [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=4999.14s)]
*  who are continuing to do what should be normal. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=5000.820000000001s)]
*  None of us have to be really courageous [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=5003.58s)]
*  to do what we are doing right now, right? [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=5005.360000000001s)]
*  It's very basic journalism that we are attempting to do. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=5006.860000000001s)]
*  But in that, I think it's impossible. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=5010.42s)]
*  Well, that's a very powerful note to end on, Rana. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=5012.12s)]
*  We really appreciate, I mean, I think that whenever, [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=5015.46s)]
*  however this period of history ends up, [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=5020.860000000001s)]
*  the essential thing that people could have done throughout it [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=5023.56s)]
*  is to tell the truth and to report on what's happening [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=5027.2s)]
*  and to not succumb to all the disinformation [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=5030.7s)]
*  and misinformation. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=5035.28s)]
*  You're an island of objective reality [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=5036.58s)]
*  and a sea of other information, let's just say. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=5039.34s)]
*  So people should read your stuff in the Washington Post [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=5042.22s)]
*  and Substack, you're on social media platforms. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=5045.58s)]
*  And thanks so much for joining us [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=5048.68s)]
*  and shedding so much light on what's happening there. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=5050.22s)]
*  Thank you so much, Ben, for having me as always. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=5053.08s)]
*  Thanks to Rana Iyob for her perspective. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=5055.22s)]
*  Thanks again to Dan Kurtz-Faelan and to Ambassador Tai, [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=5057.7s)]
*  the US Trade Rep. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=5062.7s)]
*  And thank you for listening. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=5063.86s)]
*  We'll see you next week. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbMJTOze-HE&t=5064.94s)]
