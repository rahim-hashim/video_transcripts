Video Description: Tommy Vietor and Ben Rhodes discuss the discovery of six Israeli hostages killed by Hamas, protests in Israel demanding Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu agree to a ceasefire and hostage release deal, how Biden’s rhetoric about Gaza gives Netanyahu political cover, and the challenges of the UN’s Polio vaccination rollout in Gaza. They also talk about what an election win for Germany’s far-right AfD party means for the country’s political future, why a former aide to NY Governor Kathy Hochul is being charged with working as a foreign agent for China, why X (Twitter) was blocked in Brazil, a controversial effort to reform Mexico’s judicial system, the shooting of Ugandan opposition leader Bobi Wine, and the Taliban’s ban on women speaking in public in Afghanistan. Then, Ben speaks to Tom Periello, the US Special Envoy to Sudan about the negotiations he led to address the world’s worst hunger crisis.

# Netanyahu Faces Massive Israeli Protests After Six Hostages Are Killed in Gaza
**Pod Save the World:** [September 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo)
*  Welcome to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Ben Redd. September 3rd of an election year. It's crazy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=0.0s)]
*  It's a weird post Labor Day for an election year. Yeah, doesn't feel like that. But I guess this is something [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=6.28s)]
*  It's been the longest election cycle ever and the shortest with Kamala. I know. Yeah. Yeah, that's true [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=11.96s)]
*  I was talking to a British friend who's like what is the deal with this whole like you only pay attention after a Labor Day [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=16.64s)]
*  Thing is that like a yeah, is that a real thing? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=20.76s)]
*  No, maybe how it used to be, you know [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=23.06s)]
*  One of those like phony things because back in the day like that's whenever you pay attention [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=25.48s)]
*  I don't know. I don't get it either. Well, there's a lot going on in the world this week, Ben [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=30.08s)]
*  We are gonna cover some very terrible news out of Gaza [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=34.84s)]
*  There was a major election victory for the far-right in Germany [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  The arrest of a top-ranking New York state official for allegedly secretly working as a foreign agent for China. Yeah, it's crazy [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=41.28s)]
*  Didn't see that one. This story is nuts. Yeah. Twitter is now banned in Brazil [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=48.08s)]
*  We're gonna talk about why people are concerned about a proposed reform to Mexico's judicial system a [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=51.72s)]
*  frightening attack on an opposition leader and friend of the show named Bobby wine in Uganda [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=57.24s)]
*  And then just more terrible news for women in Afghanistan and then then you just did our interview [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=62.16s)]
*  Yeah, as if we we didn't have enough [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=67.36s)]
*  To lighten it up. I talked to Tom Perriello who's the US special envoy for Sudan about his efforts to [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  Get more humanitarian aid in at some recent talks that the US led in Geneva about the multiplicity of bad actors [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=78.82s)]
*  fighting the war in Sudan and supporting from [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=86.1s)]
*  Externally and about how we can help hopefully generate some more awareness and attention on what is the world's largest humanitarian crisis [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=89.7s)]
*  The economy's had like a big cover story or multi-part special on Sudan this week [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=97.66s)]
*  It was really good and worth reading and I was looking at one of the articles [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=102.42s)]
*  Graphic about the scale of the disaster and it said [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=106.48s)]
*  If the if more help doesn't arrive in Sudan soon, it may prove to be the worst [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=110.36s)]
*  Famine anywhere in the world since the China's great leap forward in the 1950s and early 60s [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=116.08s)]
*  Yeah, those are not the kind of comparisons you want to see in the 2020s. So you're like we're reaching for some of the worst [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=121.82000000000001s)]
*  Famines in recorded history. Yeah, you describe what's happening. Yeah, and as Tom points out in the interview [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=128.48s)]
*  Like completely man-made or am it right? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=134.27999999999997s)]
*  So this is not yeah, this is just purely human beings doing things that are bringing about the potential [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=136.7s)]
*  starving to death of millions of people [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=142.94s)]
*  Yeah, and so our first topic today is going to be Gaza because of what happened over the weekend [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=144.44s)]
*  And there's just been a lot of activism around Gaza understandably [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=149.92s)]
*  So but I think you and Tom got into the fact that there just needs to be more [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=153.44s)]
*  Churn and activity and conversation about what's happening. Yeah, I mean if it's if you're purely rooting your interest in [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=156.44s)]
*  Where the highest stakes for the most numbers of people, you know [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=162.96s)]
*  Sudan which doesn't get as much attention as Gaza Ukraine would easily, you know be at the top of that list [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=167.72s)]
*  And so I think that there is some space to generate attention on this. Yeah, absolutely [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=172.28s)]
*  Okay, so let's turn to Gaza though because [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=176.96s)]
*  Over the weekend we had some really awful news [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=179.52s)]
*  Six Israeli hostages were found executed by Hamas in a Hamas tunnel under Rafa [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=181.84s)]
*  According to the Israeli military and opt-op autopsies performed on the victims [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=187.56s)]
*  These hostages have been killed just days before they were found. There was a Hamas spokesman quoted in the media later [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=191.60000000000002s)]
*  Who said they had Hamas had instructed fighters guarding hostages to execute them if the Israeli military [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=198.26000000000002s)]
*  Got close enough for a rescue operation. So it's assumed that's what's happened here [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=205.04000000000002s)]
*  Five of the hostages have been taken from the Nova Music Festival on October 7th [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=208.96s)]
*  Including a 23 year old American Israeli American named Hirsch Goldberg, Poland [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=213.12s)]
*  The sixth hostage was kidnapped from a kibbutz near the border between Israel and Gaza [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=217.54000000000002s)]
*  listeners probably saw Hirsch's parents incredibly powerful speech at the Democratic National Convention [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=223.42000000000002s)]
*  If you have not watched it, I suggest you do now their son Hirsch was quite literally a hero. He was the kid who [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=229.58s)]
*  Was hiding in a bomb shelter with some of his friends on October 7th Hamas fighters started throwing grenades in there [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=237.82000000000002s)]
*  He ran to the grenades picked them up started throwing them out [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=244.16s)]
*  It blew off half of his arm and these guys still took him captive anyway, and he survived this long such an unbelievably brave [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=247.2s)]
*  person [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=254.76s)]
*  After this horrible news though of their execution became public [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=256.2s)]
*  There have been mass demonstrations in Israel calling on the government to agree to a ceasefire and hostage release deal [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=260.15999999999997s)]
*  Israel's largest trade union called for a general strike that was in place for part of Monday until a court ordered it called off [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=267.12s)]
*  Israeli authorities believe there are more than 60 living hostages still alive in Gaza including four American citizens on Monday [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=274.24s)]
*  President Biden was asked if Netanyahu is doing enough to secure a hostage deal [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=280.88000000000005s)]
*  He said no and you kind of like typical Kurt Biden press availability. Yeah format [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=284.34000000000003s)]
*  I don't know why he does that. No really short answer [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=290.78000000000003s)]
*  It's you know tough or something. I mean we'll get into why it's not driving crazy [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=293.96000000000004s)]
*  Axios reported Biden is considering whether to present both sides with what's been described as a final deal [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=299.24s)]
*  I'm not exactly sure what that means but like kind of a take it or leave it best offer from the Americans [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=305.2s)]
*  I don't know the latest sticking point in the talks has been I thought it was an Israeli proposal though. Yeah [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=310.16s)]
*  Well, I did too. The latest sticking point has been that Netanyahu has started like late in the negotiations demanding that the Israeli military [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=314.88s)]
*  Can occupy the border region between Gaza and Egypt? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=322.56s)]
*  indefinitely [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=326.48s)]
*  That's been a non-starter for Hamas. I think for the Egyptians too [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=327.72s)]
*  So at a press conference over the weekend Netanyahu was asked about Biden's comments. He responded angrily. Here's a clip these murderers [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=330.8s)]
*  Executed six of our hostages. They shot them in the back of the head [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=340.16s)]
*  That's what's changed [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=344.96000000000004s)]
*  And now after this [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=347.36s)]
*  We're asked to show seriousness [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=350.64s)]
*  We're asked to make concessions [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=353.72s)]
*  What message does this send Hamas it says kill more hostages murder more hostages you'll get more concessions [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=356.72s)]
*  The pressure internationally must be directed at these killers at Hamas not at Israel [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=365.04s)]
*  We say yes, they say no all the time, but they also murdered these people and now we need maximum pressure on Hamas [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=372.24s)]
*  I don't believe that either President Biden or anyone [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=378.86s)]
*  Serious about achieving peace and achieving the release would seriously ask Israel [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=383.04s)]
*  Israel to make these concessions [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=389.71999999999997s)]
*  We've already made them. Okay, so it's such an utter crock of shit. But anyway, I'll get it [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=392.28s)]
*  No, I'll give you a longer analysis in a second [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=397.64s)]
*  Your reaction was my reaction which is the cynicism of him getting self-righteous in this moment is almost too much for me listen to [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=399.68s)]
*  So sorry for the long windup there Ben. Yeah, I have to cover [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=406.0s)]
*  I think we should start with the obvious which is like Hamas is responsible for murdering these people period like they're a brutal evil [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=408.32s)]
*  terrorist organization [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=414.71999999999997s)]
*  And I hope the people that did it like me justice in a similar fashion [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=416.71999999999997s)]
*  Well in a in a not extrajudicial fashion, but in me justice [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=420.91999999999996s)]
*  They're also holding just a reminder. They're holding a one-year-old baby and an 86 year old grandfather, right? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=425.59999999999997s)]
*  So there's just no justifying this no [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=431.82s)]
*  Anti-colonial argument or argument about you know, the brutality of the occupation justifies doing that to civilians [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=434.58s)]
*  No, and it's not even it is in no world [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=440.21999999999997s)]
*  Is it legitimate resistance to just you know shoot civilians in the head massacre kids at a music festival? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=443.18s)]
*  But what is also true is that BB Net Yahoo is blocking a ceasefire and hostage release deal [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=449.14s)]
*  His negotiators want a deal all the professionals in the national security world want a deal [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=454.86s)]
*  The Israeli public and the hostage families want a deal it is Netanyahu that is blocking it and [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=460.04s)]
*  Even though Joe Biden said no when asked if Netanyahu is doing enough [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=466.34000000000003s)]
*  He and his team are giving Netanyahu cover by constantly saying that Israel has agreed to this peace plan [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=470.32s)]
*  They put forward and that only Hamas is the holdup and we just know that it's true [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=477.72s)]
*  It's bullshit. And I mean just to take the Netanyahu piece of this first [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=481.64s)]
*  He has relentlessly undermined these ceasefire talks and again that doesn't absolve Hamas of any of the responsibility for any of the things they're doing [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=485.76s)]
*  But the reality is that we know from months and months and months of reporting [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=492.92s)]
*  What the actual deal is on the table that could get done and could get those hostages released [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=497.16s)]
*  And Netanyahu is the one who kind of keeps moving the goalposts on that deal and he's really been leaning into this [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=502.0s)]
*  You know [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=508.44s)]
*  Israeli control of this quarter [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=509.68s)]
*  I think in part because he knows it's a poison pill. It kills the deal, you know [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=511.52s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, so there's a legitimate security argument. He could make that they want to control this area to prevent [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=516.8s)]
*  Hamas from smuggling stuff from Egypt into Gaza via tunnels and they think I guess with the permanent occupation and what is currently a [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=522.6s)]
*  Demilitarized area you could do that [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=529.96s)]
*  But we should point out that his own security team says, you know what we can mitigate that risk if we pull out of yes [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=531.96s)]
*  Philadelphia quarter that's the key right his own military leadership is supportive of the deal that Nenya keeps killing right? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=538.08s)]
*  So the people who actually know what they're talking about when it comes to security issues, you know, Nenya has not some general [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=544.08s)]
*  Believe that this can be dressed in the hostages can be released and let's also just name the obvious fact that Nenya [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=550.36s)]
*  Wants to extend the war because it extends his term in government and out of prison [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=557.0400000000001s)]
*  Which is where he'd be if he was no longer prime minister with with immunity afforded to him [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=561.74s)]
*  He doesn't want to give Joe Biden a ceasefire, you know [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=565.88s)]
*  Cuz probably he wants Donald Trump to win the election not probably I'm sure he wants Donald Trump to win the election [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=570.16s)]
*  So, you know this you know the perception of chaos and the kind of polarizing nature of what they're doing in Gaza [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=574.64s)]
*  You know somehow good politics for him at home and in the US and when he says that [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=581.1999999999999s)]
*  You know the pressure, you know [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=587.48s)]
*  How dare they put aside the fact that he's like we can't do a ceasefire after six people were killed [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=588.9599999999999s)]
*  I mean the Palestinians are being asked to do a ceasefire after 40,000 of them at least [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=593.9599999999999s)]
*  So that that doesn't make much sense either [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=598.68s)]
*  But also the families are the ones that have been pressing him the families of the hostages are the ones who are telling us [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=600.8s)]
*  And have been for months that he's not paying attention to their concerns that he doesn't care about their family [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=606.28s)]
*  Even if you listen to him, it's about him. It's saying really about the hostages [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=611.0s)]
*  You know, he has that in common with Trump everything kind of runs back to himself [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=614.7199999999999s)]
*  And and what is so frustrating about this in terms of American policy is this is the most predictable thing in the world [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=617.8399999999999s)]
*  You know, look how many times have we sat on this podcast and talked about how Netanyahu is not a good faith actor [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=623.08s)]
*  And when you have a strategy to hug the guy from the beginning of the war and you run political interference for him [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=628.2800000000001s)]
*  Which is what you know, yeah, it's always Hamas's fault. There's an Israeli proposal [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=633.76s)]
*  There's not an Israeli proposal and by the way, the prime minister of Israel doesn't agree to it. He quoted Tony Blinken [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=637.12s)]
*  He quoted other US officials to throw their words in Biden's face in that press conference. We just played you that clip from yeah [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=642.08s)]
*  So, I mean, I you know when when Biden says no, he's not good enough [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=647.72s)]
*  Then the question is okay [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=651.6800000000001s)]
*  What do you prepare to do about it? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=653.2s)]
*  Because if you're not willing to actually impose conditions on military assistance to Israel if you're not even willing to enforce US laws [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=654.36s)]
*  About cutting off assistance to units and engage in human rights violations [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=660.6800000000001s)]
*  Why wouldn't any I'll listen to you when you stand there and say no [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=665.28s)]
*  He has not done enough and then the last thing I just want to say to tee this off Tommy [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=668.2s)]
*  And I'm I know you've got thoughts in this too is it's amazing to me when something like this happens [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=671.8000000000001s)]
*  Horrific horrific killing of these six hostages and and the US the discourse is is you know, obviously about the tragedy [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=677.4s)]
*  but then it's a kind of about you know how how hard hitting we can be in our rhetoric on Hamas and and [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=684.24s)]
*  You know very soft-pedaled, you know references to Netanyahu having political problems in Israel [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=689.5600000000001s)]
*  They have no such restraint in Israel [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=694.6800000000001s)]
*  There are hundreds of thousands of hundreds of thousands of people protesting saying it's Netanyahu's fault that these hostages are dead a discourse [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=696.24s)]
*  Unimaginable in American politics and media on this issue. I always get whiplash about that, you know [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=703.82s)]
*  I do the the US press coverage of this whole issue has got to get better like the Israeli people and the press [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=708.66s)]
*  Blame Netanyahu. They're very clear-eyed about it. Like the blood is on his hands, but if you look at [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=714.78s)]
*  Like comments from American officials or the press corps. It's like a different planet like that [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=720.22s)]
*  You pick up Politico playbook over the weekend, which we used to make fun of a lot here [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=724.66s)]
*  I actually think it's really good these days and I don't mean to pick on them [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=729.5s)]
*  But the the coverage on Monday drove me crazy. So like they note the protests in Israel [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=732.26s)]
*  They note the people are pushing they're blaming Netanyahu [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=737.86s)]
*  But then they frame it as a political problem for Kamala Harris and Tim Walls [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=740.62s)]
*  because of a Breitbart headline an [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=747.14s)]
*  Eric Erickson tweet and then a statement from Donald Trump suggesting the US has not done enough to back Israel when everyone knows the reality [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=749.58s)]
*  Is Joe Biden has given BB Netanyahu literally everything he's wants and has asked for [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=756.58s)]
*  Yeah, and and and what does this have to do with what's actually happening in Gaza? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=761.7s)]
*  I mean the perceptions in the US tend to be you know, Netanyahu comes and gives a speech to Congress [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=765.5400000000001s)]
*  It's all about like what does this mean for the politics of the United States? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=771.7s)]
*  What does this mean for the Democratic Party? They're gonna be in disarray over this issue, right? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=774.5400000000001s)]
*  Or there's this kind of Potemkin, you know focus on the ceasefire talks as if the entire [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=778.4200000000001s)]
*  Conflict can be summed up around some like readouts from a negotiation in [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=784.86s)]
*  Whatever Middle Eastern capital that's like the 900th version of the same negotiation [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=790.18s)]
*  It's been going on for months or there's like breathless reporting on Joe Biden predicting an imminent ceasefire [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=793.9399999999999s)]
*  When over the last several months things have gotten a lot worse in Gaza things have gotten worse in the regional escalation [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=799.4599999999999s)]
*  You would think actually things have gotten better [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=805.26s)]
*  Yeah [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=807.26s)]
*  by the way in which the US press attention is shifted to just the politics of the issue and you know the [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=807.54s)]
*  back-and-forth of ceasefire negotiations it really is just [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=812.86s)]
*  amazing to me like how much [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=816.86s)]
*  There's an unwillingness to kind of wrap your head around just how bad the situation is for the hostages for the [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=819.42s)]
*  Palestinian people in Gaza for the future of any potential peace for regional escalation and and it's because of this [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=827.02s)]
*  You know policy of Netanyahu's to kind of constantly perpetuate and escalate things [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=833.46s)]
*  It's because obviously Hamas is bad actors and it's because Joe Biden is unwilling to use any leverage whatsoever [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=838.34s)]
*  You know back in the spring we at least had conversations about whether he'd cut off one weapons ship [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=844.22s)]
*  And you don't even hear about that even yeah [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=848.78s)]
*  It's almost a year since the October 7th attacks the US policy has not changed at all [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=850.54s)]
*  Yeah at all there there's been there was a conversation about one shipment of 2,000 pound bombs several months ago [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=855.98s)]
*  otherwise, it's unchanged there are the ceasefire talks which are constant and like [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=861.5799999999999s)]
*  I'm not I don't doubt that the people working on those talks are working very hard [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=865.9s)]
*  And I don't doubt that they death they desperately want to deal. I'm sure they do [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=869.66s)]
*  Yeah, and I bet they're absolutely fucking furious that they have no leverage right because the British government [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=873.06s)]
*  They just decided David Lammy went out gave a speech on over the weekend a couple days ago [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=877.74s)]
*  Talking about how they did a review of whether British military assistance was being used [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=882.9s)]
*  For in violation of international or domestic law [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=888.6600000000001s)]
*  They just suspended about 30 arms export licenses to Israel on those grounds [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=891.94s)]
*  So like shout out to David Lammy and the Labour Party for getting that done [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=897.1s)]
*  We should all know though [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=900.5400000000001s)]
*  This is an important but entirely symbolic step because the British the UK says its exports constitute only [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=901.68s)]
*  0.02 percent of Israel's arms the vast majority come from the US and Germany about 70% come from the US [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=909.52s)]
*  So if we took a courageous step like this would have an enormous impact and even that forcing current law [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=915.8s)]
*  Well, that's the thing what labor did was just within their framework [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=920.96s)]
*  They said we're gonna do a review based on our own laws, you know [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=924.0s)]
*  So if the US just took a starting point and we've talked about this as a potential option for Kamala Harris to take [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=926.52s)]
*  As just a starting point if we just said, you know [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=933.24s)]
*  We're actually instead of doing these kind of like fake reviews and where we find the result we want which is we're just gonna keep [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=935.24s)]
*  Giving Israel everything they want. We're just gonna enforce the law and actually methodically investigate whether [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=941.06s)]
*  These weapons are going to potential human rights violations that alone would be a tremendous piece of leverage [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=946.76s)]
*  Just enforcing existing assault Bernie Sanders has a bill to suspend this 20 billion dollar arm sale that they're trying to rush through [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=951.72s)]
*  I mean, obviously that kind of thing should be on the table too. So there really are options here [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=959.08s)]
*  This is what's so frustrating. I'm not suggesting that those options would magically fix everything [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=963.0600000000001s)]
*  But not even trying to exert leverage is what I don't understand because the one thing, you know [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=967.28s)]
*  You know why why not at least given how bad things are try something different [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=972.24s)]
*  Yeah [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=976.98s)]
*  I some friends who listen to show and will text me and be like you and Ben sounded like some crazy [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=977.4000000000001s)]
*  Lefty radicals on this issue. I'm like no listen to what people in Israel are saying. Yeah, here's an example [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=982.8000000000001s)]
*  We spoke to a man named Nadav Tamir about this weekend's protests. He's the executive director of J Street in Israel [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=988.6400000000001s)]
*  J Street, by the way was criticized for not being hard enough on Nabi. Yahoo. I'm not calling for a ceasefire soon enough in this country [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=996.24s)]
*  Here's a clip of what he said and saw in the streets for me personally, I had connections to two of the families [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1003.84s)]
*  So it became very, you know [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1011.48s)]
*  Close at home, but I think the entire country [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1014.2s)]
*  got to know them and it was so obvious that they could have been alive and [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1018.88s)]
*  it was right after the you know, there were leaks from the war cabinet where it was clear that the [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1024.8s)]
*  defense establishment [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1032.3999999999999s)]
*  Think completely different than the Prime Minister and the only reason that why the Prime Minister is not going for a deal [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1034.3999999999999s)]
*  Is because of his political survival. I think the combination of all those things made it [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1041.0s)]
*  Very unique. There was a lot of energy and you saw many [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1047.08s)]
*  People that are not the usual suspects that I see every Saturday when I go to those demonstrations and it was also a joint [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1052.24s)]
*  Demonstration it was not the usual split between the [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1060.8s)]
*  Headquarters of the hostages and those who called for elections [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1067.68s)]
*  They were all united and it was the same message that Netanyahu [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1072.3999999999999s)]
*  Is actually killing the hostages because he's avoiding a deal. This is what Israelis are saying [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1077.92s)]
*  Yeah, the Netanyahu was killing the hostages by not taking a deal [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1083.82s)]
*  Yeah, and the and these are largely motivated again just to show the complexity of this this isn't even about you know, the [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1086.9s)]
*  Palestinian circumstances in Gaza Strip. These are just Israelis who think the hostages should be out and Netanyahu is [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1094.5800000000002s)]
*  Killing that so it does just it [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1100.5400000000002s)]
*  showcases the need from both a kind of [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1104.8200000000002s)]
*  Policy perspective in terms of bringing leverage to bear but also a discourse perspective of the need to just change how we're approaching this [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1109.18s)]
*  That's not yeah, it's not some super left-wing thing to basically be like why are we continuing to do something? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1116.14s)]
*  It's not working. Yeah, and by the way, you mentioned how things are just getting worse every week last week [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1121.7s)]
*  We talked about the polio outbreak that's happening in Gaza as we speak [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1125.98s)]
*  There is a major vaccination effort happening to try to vaccinate children in the Gaza Strip to prevent this from spreading [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1129.54s)]
*  We spoke with Louise Wateridge a UN spokesperson in Gaza about how that effort is going. Here's a clip [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1137.16s)]
*  You know, we're vaccinating for an extremely dangerous disease in the middle of a war zone [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1142.82s)]
*  So while there is some respite in the sense that there are temporary humanitarian pauses while the vaccinations are [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1148.54s)]
*  You know issued the bombing continues after the bombing continues in the night [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1156.6599999999999s)]
*  And there's so many diseases spreading that we're we're trying to focus on polio on this one disease [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1162.3799999999999s)]
*  But on the backdrop that there's you know sewage running through the streets and people living on top of each other hepatitis A spreading [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1169.72s)]
*  So it's it's you know, on the one hand, it's a relief that this campaign is going well [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1177.64s)]
*  But as with many things in the Gaza Strip throughout this war everything else remains to be such a such a huge challenge [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1183.28s)]
*  It's just priorities. What do you need to do in a war zone? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1190.6000000000001s)]
*  Is it a priority today to get children vaccinated or is it a priority to get food? [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1193.96s)]
*  Is it a priority to get water and then in four weeks we have to do it all again in four weeks these children [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1198.96s)]
*  640,000 children will need a second round of the polio vaccination drop. So [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1206.28s)]
*  It's it's going well, but we've still got a long way to go and we have to take it every day as it comes [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1212.1200000000001s)]
*  It's worth noting that the the IDF is helping facilitate this effort [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1217.24s)]
*  I would imagine that in part because there are huge chunks, especially the ultra-orthodox population in Israel that are unvaccinated [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1221.44s)]
*  So polio will not stay in the Gaza Strip. It will come to Israel and it will affect huge parts of the population there [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1228.76s)]
*  If it spreads, yeah, that's a really good point. And the only thing I was gonna say is you listen to that and you think about [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1235.0s)]
*  the people doing this work, I mean [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1239.2s)]
*  The the humanitarian workers that just keep going and you know, you and I've heard the you know presentations by [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1241.2s)]
*  You know doctors and medical workers who've left Gaza, you know, the DNC had a panel with one [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1247.94s)]
*  It's just extraordinary what what these people are doing, you know, I mean obviously [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1253.9s)]
*  They would usually say I'm just doing my job. It's part of my identity [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1259.3000000000002s)]
*  But you know shout out to the people going in there trying to vaccinate, you know kids [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1262.88s)]
*  Yeah, you're at risk of disease yourself of getting killed by Hamas of getting killed by the IDF [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1267.3000000000002s)]
*  Yeah of getting I just hurt or lost somewhere. I mean, it's it's unimaginable [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1272.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah final thing I just want to point I want to make that I'm sure that people listening were thinking [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1276.1399999999999s)]
*  Okay, how can you guys talk like this about the Biden policy and then support [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1282.1799999999998s)]
*  Kamala Harris aren't isn't what you're saying that they're just as bad as Trump and I just want to say no [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1286.2199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not saying that Kamala Harris first of all has signaled that she disagrees with Biden on Gaza [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1293.8999999999999s)]
*  We don't know how much she doesn't have a lot of space [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1298.6999999999998s)]
*  We'll find out but it's up to us to push her I think however [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1300.4599999999998s)]
*  Trump's team is 100% in support of Netanyahu and his right-wing government and just an example to share with people [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1303.78s)]
*  So Trump's former ambassador to Israel David Friedman has a new book out [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1311.22s)]
*  In that book he suggests that the United States should redirect [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1315.74s)]
*  $1 billion worth of aid that is supposed to go to the Palestinians specifically to Palestinian security forces [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1321.58s)]
*  We're basically doing the contractors for the idea doing the idea of bidding to keep the West Bank secure [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1326.9199999999998s)]
*  And put that money towards the annexation of the West Bank. Yeah, Miriam Allison the widow of the late [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1333.5s)]
*  Right-wing billionaire Sheldon Adelson has reportedly put like a wish list forward to Trump [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1340.3799999999999s)]
*  Things she wants from for Israel policy that includes annexation of the West Bank for a hundred million dollars in [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1345.34s)]
*  Support for his campaign and I believe she spent something in the well the last time I checked the number was like 55 million [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1352.46s)]
*  Yeah, so we don't know that Trump has accepted and agreed to that wish list [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1359.3000000000002s)]
*  But I got a guess well the other thing because there's been so much going on [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1363.8600000000001s)]
*  You pointed to is the West Bank right and and and this is I think where the differences are most profound in the sense that [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1367.0600000000002s)]
*  These really is just launched major military operation the West Bank that you know that kind of barely registered to [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1373.3000000000002s)]
*  But it's of a piece of the fact that you know, the real end goal for Netanyahu is not Gaza [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1379.42s)]
*  It's it's the annexation of the West Bank, you know, that's what the right wing Israeli government is focused on and [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1385.6999999999998s)]
*  Trump would just totally give a green light to that. Can you really see Trump going to the mat? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1391.4199999999998s)]
*  You know over the West Bank [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1395.98s)]
*  God, no, and so there's a real difference between existing US policy and what Trump would do and yeah [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1397.74s)]
*  I think we have to take seriously like who's the president matters a lot and kind of the judgment calls you make and [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1402.46s)]
*  Kamala Harris has been a part of this administration has been a part of that Gaza policy [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1408.22s)]
*  But I think clearly would approach the issue with a different perspective than Joe Biden [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1412.74s)]
*  Who was kind of very personally invested in this hug BB strategy? [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1417.3s)]
*  like he thought you know, he knew how to deal with BB knew how to deal with the Israelis and so I think we do get a [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1420.6599999999999s)]
*  Something of an opportunity for not a totally fresh start, but at least a pivot with a Kamala Harris [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1426.3s)]
*  Yeah, agree with that and with Trump you get you you get a questioner building condos [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1431.62s)]
*  Okay enough of that, okay very very very frustrating [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1438.9399999999998s)]
*  All right. This is gonna be one of those bad news constantly episodes though Ben [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1442.82s)]
*  So interesting though interesting stuff our next story is that in Germany? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1446.3s)]
*  Where the ultra white wing AFD party did extremely well in state parliamentary elections the past weekend [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1450.74s)]
*  Ben's got his head in his hands the AFD won the most votes in the state of Thuringia [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1456.54s)]
*  Where they got nearly one-third of the vote? [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1460.3s)]
*  This is the first time a far-right party has won the most votes in a state election since the Nazi era [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1462.78s)]
*  The AFD also did well in neighboring Saxony where they got second place [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1468.22s)]
*  Losing to the conservative CDU party by a little bit more than a percentage point. So it's like 1.2% [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1472.54s)]
*  a few pieces of context [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1478.1399999999999s)]
*  So this is a regional election not a state not a countrywide election [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1480.1399999999999s)]
*  So about 7% of the German population was eligible to vote so it's not reflective of the entire country [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1483.8s)]
*  Also, the other major political parties in in Germany have so far ruled out forming a coalition with the AFD [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1490.34s)]
*  So at the moment it seems unlikely that they'll end up in a government that there will be an AFD [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1496.94s)]
*  led government any of these states, but [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1501.8600000000001s)]
*  The AFD in eastern Germany is especially extreme. They're like the they're far right of the far right [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1504.38s)]
*  So in so much so that German intelligence has labeled them a threat to democracy itself [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1509.98s)]
*  And the leader of the AFD party in Thuringia has been fined twice for using Nazi era slogans [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1515.8200000000002s)]
*  So these are like real deal fascists [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1521.54s)]
*  According to various German political analysts AFD candidates have successfully gained support by attacking immigration and [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1524.74s)]
*  German support for the war in Ukraine and then interestingly there was a populist left-wing party called the BSW [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1531.66s)]
*  They took third in both elections [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1537.1000000000001s)]
*  Despite being I think formed less than a year ago [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1539.66s)]
*  They have similar anti-immigrant views similar anti-war views but are just coming from essentially like a communist perspective [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1542.46s)]
*  But they've also ruled out working with the AFD [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1549.18s)]
*  So there's gonna be another regional election in Eastern Germany in a few weeks [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1551.18s)]
*  In Brandenburg, which is currently controlled by the Social Democratic Party [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1555.3400000000001s)]
*  So we'll see if like the people running the entire country [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1559.18s)]
*  How they do against the AFD so [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1563.5s)]
*  All of this is a prelude to a national election in about a year [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1566.46s)]
*  So Ben I think long story short [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1570.9s)]
*  We probably don't have to explain to listeners why an ultra right-wing [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1572.42s)]
*  In Germany coming to power would be bad [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1576.06s)]
*  But the question is what does Olaf Schultz the current chancellor do to stop them his approval? [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1578.14s)]
*  I think went from 73 percent in 2022 and is now down below 30 percent. So things are not good [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1584.8600000000001s)]
*  He's in big trouble. He's leading this [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1591.9s)]
*  three-party coalition that is [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1594.46s)]
*  Incredibly strained at the moment and there is this constant debate about whether [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1596.7s)]
*  Someone like Ben is going to be able to do something [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1601.82s)]
*  Whether someone like Schultz should try to accommodate and co-opt parties like the AFD [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1604.8600000000001s)]
*  Or fight them like what's the best way to manage fascism? [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1611.42s)]
*  I think we have a lot of takes on this podcast [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1615.9s)]
*  Tommy and I wouldn't expect anyone to agree with all those takes at all [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1619.42s)]
*  But the one take i'm most confident of is that it's never a good thing when nazis start winning elections in Germany [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1624.06s)]
*  You know, that's right. That's a bad thing [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1629.42s)]
*  Like let's just kind of put that in a box that is like agree to keep that pendor's box closed [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1631.34s)]
*  I mean, I I think look part of what's alarming is that this is happening not just because of like something, you know [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1636.62s)]
*  Triggering it right now. There are like structural issues in german politics, you know hostility to migration [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1643.9s)]
*  Kind of backlash to globalization like we've seen here some identity issues [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1650.78s)]
*  Um exacerbated by the cost of living frustration with german support for ukraine in the east, you know [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1655.26s)]
*  And so these aren't issues that are going away and that that's what's kind of alarming is that the afd is getting like steadily more traction [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1661.5800000000002s)]
*  There's a lot of antibodies in german society to kind of reject this and i'm confident that the [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1668.46s)]
*  Majorities will band together and try to keep these people out of government even where they you know [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1674.2s)]
*  won pluralities and and not let them win a national election, but [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1678.54s)]
*  I think the problem is also that the afd is kind of scrambling all of german politics, right? They're peeling off [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1683.02s)]
*  People from the right, you know, so the christian democrats the center-right party, you know [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1689.02s)]
*  They're kind of radicalizing some of those people winning some of those votes [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1692.86s)]
*  There's some people that are like in that weird space where they're like so far left that they're far right, you know [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1695.74s)]
*  So they're peeling off people from kind of the far left and and I think part of what's missing in terms of what can [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1700.22s)]
*  Olaf schultz do or any german politician? [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1704.62s)]
*  There's a kind of admirable german political trait to not be particularly charismatic or populist because you're afraid of [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1707.5s)]
*  Like of being you know, like i'm going to your original point [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1715.26s)]
*  Yeah, obama used to say to merkel you need to speak up more, you know [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1718.3799999999999s)]
*  You need to make kind of more values based arguments for the europe and all these things and she'd say like barack [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1721.34s)]
*  You don't want a a charismatic german chancellor, you know, which I was did she know that was funny when she said she did [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1726.06s)]
*  It was just kind of dry. I'm gonna miracle joke that she used a couple of times [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1731.58s)]
*  And and and both merkel and schultz they all kind of reflect this kind of technocratic approach [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1734.8600000000001s)]
*  I don't know. I think german politicians are going to have to find ways to start to to [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1739.66s)]
*  To be a little bit more populist, you know [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1745.3400000000001s)]
*  For good, you know [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1747.66s)]
*  In the sense that you don't want all the energy to be with people who just are like these lunatics on the far right [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1749.02s)]
*  You don't want to just be perpetually defending an establishment that everybody's fed up with, you know [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1756.38s)]
*  So there's room for some I mean, I I like all schultz's politics [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1761.02s)]
*  so, you know, hopefully he could do it, but somebody's gonna have to kind of connect a little bit more to the [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1764.6200000000001s)]
*  Grievances people are feeling without succumbing to far-right solutions, right? [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1769.88s)]
*  Because otherwise you're kind of ceding all that terrain to these guys [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1774.54s)]
*  Yeah, I mean we should know the other kind of big fight or experiment against the far right was in france [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1777.74s)]
*  Yeah, where president macron called that snap election in july [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1782.78s)]
*  Uh where it seems like after the first round the far-right parties were going to romp and just you know [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1786.3799999999999s)]
*  Uh, maybe win an outright majority and then the second round they did significantly worse [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1793.6599999999999s)]
*  It was in absolute terms. It was very bad for macron and his party, but it did seem to like blunt their momentum [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1799.1s)]
*  however [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1804.78s)]
*  They still haven't formed a government. They don't have a prime minister [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1806.06s)]
*  Uh their like it was seen as this impressive judith jujitsu move to deal with marine lapin [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1809.1s)]
*  But now macron refuses to name a candidate from the far left coalition because he hates them, too [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1815.98s)]
*  So it's led to this political impasse. And so I think you're seeing a similar dynamic in germany where the afd won an outright [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1821.4199999999998s)]
*  Not a majority, but they won the most votes [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1828.78s)]
*  Uh in one of these provinces, but no one is going to form a coalition with them [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1831.74s)]
*  So they'll still be out of government [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1835.6599999999999s)]
*  So they'll still get to play this grievance card and act like you know [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1837.26s)]
*  The will of the people is not being heard [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1840.78s)]
*  Because this neo-nazi party is not in government and they have no responsibility for anything still [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1843.02s)]
*  It's just a question of how you defeat these people politically [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1847.1s)]
*  If they never assume responsibility for anything and get electoral consequences for failing to manage it [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1850.54s)]
*  Yeah, and and look I I can't get too into the weeds of the intricacies of french political personalities for that role [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1856.78s)]
*  but I mean, I think ultimately macron needs to like [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1862.86s)]
*  Sign off on on someone to his left to being prime minister like that's how they won the election, you know [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1867.66s)]
*  But in part because again like it's not good by the way [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1872.6200000000001s)]
*  It wasn't good when kamala harris is doing better here and not to weigh too much in american political analysis [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1875.42s)]
*  By literally running as a bit of a change candidate, even though she's vice president [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1880.54s)]
*  joe biden was in the same trap that [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1883.74s)]
*  Macron and schultz have been in which is he's just defending a status quo. It's like, you know defending the neoliberal order [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1886.1200000000001s)]
*  You know like like that's what people are pissed about and so all these politicians have to find ways to [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1892.54s)]
*  open up a vein [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1898.46s)]
*  Of of of not just defending the institutions, but also [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1900.8600000000001s)]
*  Reforming them, you know and for macron that's got to be [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1905.0s)]
*  Indicating he gets that he didn't win a mandate in that election and insofar as the far right was defeated [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1908.22s)]
*  The left helped him do that. So yeah, there may be certain people he doesn't want to see as prime minister [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1913.9s)]
*  But he's got an ideologically compromiser. Yeah macron's like, uh, but how about those olympics? Yeah, pretty good, huh? Yeah [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1917.74s)]
*  Yeah, whoever was in charge of the olympics. Maybe you should be prime minister because that was pretty fucking great [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1923.02s)]
*  It was great although I heard a story today with I guess the mayor of paris wants to keep the olympic rings on the eiffel [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1926.6999999999998s)]
*  tower in perpetuity [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1931.9799999999998s)]
*  Naturally, that's like having like your high school football [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1933.5s)]
*  Okay next story bed [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1939.26s)]
*  So we got this late breaking story out of new york today where apparently a former aide to current new york governor kathy hokal [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1940.54s)]
*  Uh, and this this woman worked for the former governor andrew cuomo was arrested and charged with acting as a foreign agent for the chinese government [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1948.54s)]
*  Uh, also charged with money laundering and conspiracy to commit bank fraud. So this woman's name is linda son [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1955.5s)]
*  She's a 40 year old [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1960.78s)]
*  She worked her way up the ladder in state government to become deputy chief of staff to hokal [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1962.0600000000002s)]
*  And then she left that job and I think was working in the new york labor department. Her husband was also charged. He's a businessman [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1966.78s)]
*  Um the linda son allegedly worked to block meetings between taiwanese officials and new york state leaders [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1972.46s)]
*  She worked to remove references to taiwan or the uighurs and various state communications [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1980.3000000000002s)]
*  And then did some other favors for you know, sort of the chinese government [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1985.9s)]
*  In return the chinese government funneled money into her husband's businesses in china [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1990.0600000000002s)]
*  And then she and her husband, uh linda son and her husband used that money to buy a bunch of multi-million dollar houses [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=1994.5400000000002s)]
*  In a 2024 ferrari. Yes [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2001.74s)]
*  I don't know how you'd be like a state government worker and get away with having a ferrari [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2004.22s)]
*  You forgot the chef's kiss which is that they delivered peking duck dinners [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2007.26s)]
*  Prepared by the consulate chef to her parents [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2011.98s)]
*  Yeah, so like the the head of the the chinese consulate succulent duck who prepared peking ducks and deliver it to her parents [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2014.94s)]
*  Yeah, none of this was very soft. I have a lot of thoughts on this. Uh, I mean first of all [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2021.58s)]
*  It's amazing to me that the chinese were paying like these people had millions of dollars [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2028.3s)]
*  And yeah when you go into the details [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2032.86s)]
*  She's blocking a few meetings with the taiwanese she was getting some like fake [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2035.26s)]
*  Proclamations or something that they give to visiting delegations with like the seal of new york on it [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2039.9599999999998s)]
*  I mean she wasn't delivering the nuclear codes and so on the one end that makes you think like what are the chinese paying for? [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2044.3799999999999s)]
*  um [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2050.06s)]
*  And how did this person like you said think they could get away with having all these they had like a two million dollar place [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2051.02s)]
*  In hawaii or something. Yeah, um, did they think no one would notice but the the alarming thing is you do keep hearing more and more [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2055.5s)]
*  And we saw the scandal in the uk where there are you know, severe security compromises from chinese intelligence [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2062.38s)]
*  um, we've heard the same thing in canada if they're spending this much money on like a [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2068.2200000000003s)]
*  Relatively obscure albeit senior state official [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2072.86s)]
*  It does kind of make you wonder like like like how how far the tentacles are running of their intelligence operations [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2076.1400000000003s)]
*  This was my exact reaction. I was like on the one hand. This is kind of a shocking example of the chinese government [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2081.5800000000004s)]
*  Penetrating like a new york state government office at the highest level just how much they care that they're paying attention like state government [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2087.74s)]
*  Yeah, the deputy chief of staff the new york governor like that. That's a big deal. That's not with a lot of power [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2093.66s)]
*  On the other hand. Yeah, one of the things that linda son allegedly did [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2098.7s)]
*  for them was uh, the the like intersection sent in a request for a lunar new year video [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2103.5s)]
*  And uh linda son worked to make sure it didn't mention the weaker [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2110.46s)]
*  Yeah [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2114.06s)]
*  You couldn't just edit that out [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2115.1000000000004s)]
*  It just shows how like this kind of thin-skinned approach is so like they're in state governments are probably in local governments [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2117.34s)]
*  I mean the thing you also worry about you worry about the intelligence penetration that might exist [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2123.6600000000003s)]
*  Uh, if they have this kind of far-reaching effort [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2128.38s)]
*  But you also hope that there's not some backlash against asian americans [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2131.1800000000003s)]
*  Asian americans and political life suddenly being suspected, you know, like there's got to be a way to approach this it is [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2135.42s)]
*  Is you know more deliberate than that too? Yeah, the washington post did this deep dive into um [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2141.5s)]
*  Pro chinese chinese communist party demonstrators that were sent into the streets of san francisco [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2147.0s)]
*  Apparently directed by the chinese consulate in la [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2153.02s)]
*  Around the apex summit whenever that was two years ago last year [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2156.2999999999997s)]
*  Um, so they were like so shijin ping was in san francisco for this summit. They knew they were going to be anti [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2159.66s)]
*  CCP protesters, so they sent basically a bunch of thugs [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2164.9399999999996s)]
*  To the area to beat the shit out of them. There's videos of it. Erdogan did the same thing. Remember that [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2168.62s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah beat the crap out of our people and trump was like cool. Yeah, I mean it yeah like this is [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2173.18s)]
*  there's a level of aggression in in this kind of thuggery and and kind of [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2179.98s)]
*  Meticulous attention to detail right like yeah the lunar new year statement who gives a shit, you know [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2188.2799999999997s)]
*  It's um, it's a desire to censor everything [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2193.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it shows how their mindset of total control at home like kind of spills over into how they look at the world [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2196.06s)]
*  Yeah, well said ccp [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2201.42s)]
*  Uh speaking of total control, um, if you are a twitter addict like ben and i are you should not go to brazil [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2203.02s)]
*  Because as of saturday the service is no longer available there. Here's why [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2208.7799999999997s)]
*  Back in april. I think we talked about this at the time ben a judge named alexandre de morais [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2213.18s)]
*  Forgive me portuguese speakers if i'm if i'm getting that wrong morais, I think is how you say it [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2218.38s)]
*  Uh demanded that twitter shut down dozens of accounts in brazil for spreading [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2222.54s)]
*  Disinformation and pushing narratives to overturn the 2022 election [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2227.3199999999997s)]
*  That was the election where lula de silva defeated jair bolsonaro who then encouraged his followers to storm the capital sounds familiar [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2231.2599999999998s)]
*  musk refused the request to shut down these accounts and then he ordered [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2239.34s)]
*  Twitter's offices in brazil closed so that none of his staff could be arrested for refusing to comply with this judicial order [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2243.5s)]
*  So judge morais ordered twitter to name a legal representative in brazil [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2251.42s)]
*  Twitter refused and that led to the suspension on saturday. So the way this works is it's pretty comprehensive [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2256.7s)]
*  So brazilian internet service providers were told to block access to twitter [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2262.22s)]
*  The court told apple and google to remove twitter from the app store in brazil [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2266.06s)]
*  I should be calling it x but I think x is such a lame name that you can't say it [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2269.74s)]
*  So i'm gonna say brazil, uh to twitter and then if you try to access twitter with a vpn [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2272.8599999999997s)]
*  You can be fined nearly nine thousand dollars. So it's like pretty comprehensive and intense [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2278.62s)]
*  according to the bbc [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2283.8999999999996s)]
*  Brazil even froze the bank accounts of another elon musk company starlink the satellite company in brazil to try to you know [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2285.5s)]
*  Get more leverage. Um, so again, there's a big deal in brazil [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2293.18s)]
*  The associated press had 40 million brazilians use twitter at least once a month about a fifth of the country [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2296.54s)]
*  Previously, there's a long history of brazil [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2302.38s)]
*  Uh being pretty hard-ass against social media companies [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2305.6600000000003s)]
*  They suspended whatsapp service in brazil a couple times in 2015 and 2016 [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2308.78s)]
*  After the company refused to comply with law enforcement requests for user data [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2313.7400000000002s)]
*  This same judge got into a huge fight with telegram. We talked about them last week actually a little quick update on that [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2318.3s)]
*  Pavel beret [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2324.8599999999997s)]
*  The ceo who's arrested in france and I think charged [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2329.18s)]
*  With some pretty intense charges about the failure to deal with child sexual material being spread on the platform [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2332.22s)]
*  So that's the story is not going anywhere [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2338.62s)]
*  Um elon tweeted that he's gonna have starlink provide free internet service to brazilians until all of this is sorted out. So [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2341.18s)]
*  Anyway, everyone's got too much power here. I don't know then i'm still like torn [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2349.66s)]
*  I the the look my american first amendment [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2353.02s)]
*  You know kind of spirit comes out here when I hear about [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2357.98s)]
*  an unelected judge deciding that you can block an entire [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2361.02s)]
*  Uh social media service in a country. It does feel a little authoritarian [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2365.98s)]
*  This used to be an issue where it's just sort of like one unelected justice going after twitter [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2370.86s)]
*  But now actually a broader panel of five supreme court justices has [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2374.94s)]
*  Affirmed the ruling so I don't know where how are you feeling about this? I I mean, yeah, it does feel like [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2379.82s)]
*  The the response from elon musk right of basically telling these people to completely fuck off is [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2386.1400000000003s)]
*  You know quite literally. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah quite. I mean it's not a constructive response, you know, so so [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2391.7400000000002s)]
*  This is one where his kind of pugilist, you know [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2397.6600000000003s)]
*  blundering american [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2400.6200000000003s)]
*  Ceo kind of ethos [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2402.54s)]
*  You know kind of escalates the the issue I think my main takeaway is [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2405.42s)]
*  Are first of all even if you do ban x there [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2409.02s)]
*  You know, I think history shows and kind of people migrate to other platforms, right? [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2413.18s)]
*  So you're not going to end disinformation with an action like this [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2416.7s)]
*  But it does start to show I think that the other bigger point is that I think we may be entering a period where there is [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2420.06s)]
*  A normalization of much more aggressive government action against social media platforms [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2427.1s)]
*  We've already seen the u.s. Pass a law banning tiktok [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2430.86s)]
*  We'll see if that goes into force [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2433.82s)]
*  We've seen the french kind of making this pretty aggressive move against telegram [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2435.34s)]
*  We see brazil banning x I kind of feel like we're heading into a chapter in this [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2439.58s)]
*  experimentation of social media breaking our brains and political cultures where [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2445.16s)]
*  You're going to see kind of these ad hoc, you know [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2449.98s)]
*  What you'd like to see is governments getting together and being like how do we regulate this? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2452.06s)]
*  How do we kind of slow the poison of algorithms that you know turbocharge anger and fear and stuff [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2456.14s)]
*  It in in the place of that. I think what we're going to get are these like pretty you know knee-jerk [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2462.62s)]
*  movements to ban [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2467.8799999999997s)]
*  This platform or that platform in this country or that country and it'll be interesting to see how that kind of shakes out [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2469.18s)]
*  You know, yeah, I mean elon's also in fights with regulators in the uk [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2474.2999999999997s)]
*  With the european union. I mean, it's weird you read these stories and he's often described as a free speech absolutist [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2478.7s)]
*  And then a couple months later he winds up at a meeting with shi jin ping in china to try to hawk more teslas [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2484.2400000000002s)]
*  So, yeah, I don't know. I'm not sure I totally buy that [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2490.48s)]
*  There may be some the venn diagram as kamala Harris would say may have an overlapping circle of his self-interest [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2493.2000000000003s)]
*  His ad hoc commitment to free speech. Yeah, I think that's right. Um speaking of uh reform [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2500.2400000000002s)]
*  So mexico's outgoing president andres manuel lopez obredor amlo as he's known has a month left in office [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2506.0800000000004s)]
*  So he's trying to jam through a major overhaul of the judicial system through mexico's congress [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2512.3199999999997s)]
*  Where his party has a supermajority in the lower house and is just one seat shy of that in the senate [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2517.9199999999996s)]
*  So amlo wants a number of constitutional reforms including the direct election of more than 7 000 judges in mexico [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2523.04s)]
*  Any reduction of the number of supreme court justices in their term links? [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2530.16s)]
*  Amlo claims that this is a way to root out corruption [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2534.64s)]
*  But judges and judicial employees and human rights activists in the country's opposition all see it as a threat to having an independent judiciary [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2537.84s)]
*  There have been some big demonstrations both for and against this move by amlo including strike by judicial workers [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2546.08s)]
*  Uh anti-reform protesters actually forced the legislators to move the debate to a sports arena [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2552.8s)]
*  Because they formed a human chain around the lower house building. That's an impressive protest [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2558.4s)]
*  Um, we caught up with our buddy dan restrepo the founding partner of dinamica [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2562.7200000000003s)]
*  Who spoke about the complicated nature of popular debate around these reforms given the popularity of amlo and his lefty authoritarianism [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2566.7200000000003s)]
*  Here's a clip from that conversation. You have to admit and the reason he's able to do this [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2574.7200000000003s)]
*  Is lopez obredor's political movement is very popular [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2579.52s)]
*  Um, he over the course of the last six years has delivered for the mexican population [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2582.64s)]
*  They just delivered electorally for his successor claudio shainbaum will take office on october 1st [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2587.28s)]
*  Where she won the most votes any freely elected? [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2593.28s)]
*  President has won in the history of mexico. So at some level there's a lot of popular support for this [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2598.2400000000002s)]
*  But there's also a significant concern [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2604.64s)]
*  In the population and outside the country and quite frankly in the the folks who are going to have to interact with the judiciary [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2607.84s)]
*  Are raising concerns about what does it mean to have a directly elected? [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2616.2400000000002s)]
*  Elected [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2620.32s)]
*  judicial entity [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2621.6000000000004s)]
*  Particularly at a time when lopez obredor is trying to undermine [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2623.84s)]
*  The ability of the electoral authority to carry out elections [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2628.88s)]
*  So dan mentioned to us also in that conversation that there's only a few places in the world with directly elected judges [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2632.6400000000003s)]
*  Some parts of the u.s [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2638.0s)]
*  At the state level and then in bolivia where they recently put in place direct elections and I think now a lot of people regret it [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2639.44s)]
*  Um, there's a lot of politis politicization of judges that's leading to problems [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2645.6000000000004s)]
*  A number of members of congress have been critical [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2650.4s)]
*  Of this plan by omlo the u.s ambassador to mexico ken salazar said that he believes quote a popular direct election of judges [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2653.2000000000003s)]
*  Is a major risk to the functioning of mexico's democracy that resulted in omlo halting diplomatic relations with the u.s. Embassy [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2660.56s)]
*  Um, but so ben mexico just elected a new president claudia shainbaum as dan mentioned. She is a protege of omlo [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2667.52s)]
*  The question I think a lot of political observers have had is they don't know a lot about what she really thinks [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2675.36s)]
*  Uh, is she going to have autonomy and really be in charge or is omlo going to continue to try to pull the strings? [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2680.56s)]
*  from off stage [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2686.4s)]
*  I wonder if you think this kind of 11th hour [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2688.0800000000004s)]
*  Power grab suggests that that will be the case or does this is this him trying to get done all the things he wants to get [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2691.6000000000004s)]
*  Done before he's gone. I mean it certainly feels like a guy who's like, okay [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2698.48s)]
*  Here's a pretty contentious reform that's on my list and and i'd rather you know take i'm wildly popular [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2702.56s)]
*  Uh, i'm on the way out. I'm gonna try to ram this thing through on the way out the door [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2710.08s)]
*  So she doesn't have to you know, kind of makes it takes one thing off her plate [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2713.68s)]
*  You know in terms of the agenda that he wants to implement [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2717.28s)]
*  Yeah, I do think it's problematic as much as it sounds good, right elect judges [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2720.08s)]
*  um, you know [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2724.2400000000002s)]
*  We've seen in israel we've seen in this country in the united states [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2725.92s)]
*  We kind of started messing with the character of the judiciary is very destabilizing [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2728.48s)]
*  um, and and yeah, like he's you know, he's got broad popular support, but [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2732.7200000000003s)]
*  You know when it's a judiciary you're talking about [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2737.28s)]
*  Institutions are going to shape people's lives 10 years from now 20 years from now [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2740.1600000000003s)]
*  It's not just like win an election do certain policies that said I think to dan's point [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2743.12s)]
*  There's this kind of dismissive attitude sometimes towards omlo that kind of disregards the fact that that he's really popular, you know [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2748.6400000000003s)]
*  and and that you know the the institutions that [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2755.44s)]
*  a lot of the you know [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2759.04s)]
*  Institutionalists are defending have been widely perceived as corrupt for a very long time in mexico [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2760.7000000000003s)]
*  So, you know you'd like to see a meeting in the middle right between [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2765.44s)]
*  Omlo, you know not pushing reforms so fast that they're kind of breaking apart these institutions and losing the confidence of you know [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2769.1200000000003s)]
*  An important minority of the population there [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2775.44s)]
*  But you'd also like to see people meet omlo in the middle and and shanebam alternates her [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2777.6s)]
*  And and she offers that opportunity. She might be like a somewhat less from everything we've seen about her [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2782.7200000000003s)]
*  She's unlikely to have like, you know, three hour daily talk shows where she excruciates her enemies [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2788.08s)]
*  You know, she was a little more technocratic so that might be an opportunity to kind of find some new [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2792.3199999999997s)]
*  You know center in mexican politics. I always forget that ken salazar is our u.s. Ambassador down there [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2797.7599999999998s)]
*  He's a former u.s. Senator. Yeah by all [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2802.96s)]
*  Accounts like a very good guy, but he seems to be like the only official in the government that regularly does battle with omlo [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2805.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it's like the u.s. The the the white house doesn't seem to want to pick a fight [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2812.08s)]
*  They just want help on immigration [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2816.64s)]
*  Yeah [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2819.7599999999998s)]
*  Just get png'd left and right. I mean what I was thinking when I saw this tommy is like how awkward for joe biden because [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2822.24s)]
*  They've actually managed to really arrest the flows across the border [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2829.2s)]
*  Kamala harris's electoral fortunes are obviously tied in part to kind of how chaotic the border looks [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2833.44s)]
*  And so omlo has this massive leverage and but shamedown will after uh, you know [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2838.3199999999997s)]
*  Because like if they stop playing ball with us on migration it causes huge political problems in the u.s [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2844.24s)]
*  And so it does kind of limit, you know, you're probably your willingness to take on these things [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2849.92s)]
*  Yes, you're just an ambassador like kind of trying to do the right thing [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2854.4s)]
*  But I wonder if he feels hung out to dry. I mean, I I don't know. I'm guessing i'm wondering aloud [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2857.04s)]
*  Someone's got to speak for ken salazar. That's what i'm talking about, man [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2861.52s)]
*  We'll uh, we'll find out maybe he'll write into the show. Um a couple more things ben. So we had some really bad news [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2864.8s)]
*  Earlier this morning before we started recording [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2870.6400000000003s)]
*  Um, we have had on this show a couple times a ugandan opposition leader named bobby wine [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2872.96s)]
*  Bobby wine was an incredibly popular singer who decided to run for office [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2878.88s)]
*  Against uganda's corrupt [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2883.42s)]
*  autocratic [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2886.2200000000003s)]
*  authoritarian leader yawar musabini [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2887.42s)]
*  in response [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2890.0800000000004s)]
*  Bobby and a lot of his supporters faced brutal brutal repression [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2891.36s)]
*  Uh physical violence they had votes stolen from them. So that as it gets [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2895.84s)]
*  And earlier today, we saw that bobby was shot and wounded in the confrontation with police [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2900.56s)]
*  Um, it's not exactly clear what happened yet. This is you know, late breaking. I was talking to a friend in africa who said [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2906.1600000000003s)]
*  Uh, he wasn't sure whether bobby was hit with a bullet or maybe he had been shot with something like a tear gas canister [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2912.8s)]
*  Either way can like cause real damage, but the fear is in uganda that this is just the latest example [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2919.44s)]
*  Uh of musabini's people pushing the envelope to see how much violence they can inflict on their political opponents [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2925.6800000000003s)]
*  And get away with it [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2932.64s)]
*  so hopefully the u.s [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2933.84s)]
*  Government will say something and it's not just like we are monitoring reports and concerned, you know [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2935.2s)]
*  It's something a little tougher than that. But uh, I mean this is a very big deal [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2940.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean bobby and his wife barbie actually, you know, we're in the studio and I make that point because [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2946.16s)]
*  He could easily have left right? I mean, he's kind of got a global reputation. He's a subject of a [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2952.48s)]
*  You know oscar-nominated documentary film [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2957.84s)]
*  You know, he could have taken his activism someplace else and he's one of these people [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2961.12s)]
*  That chose to go back to uganda knowing he'd be in danger, you know, and there's some pretty inspiring pictures of him [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2965.68s)]
*  Leading marches tens of thousands of people, you know upon his return [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2972.64s)]
*  So the first point is it just speaks to his courage and just being there and keeping up this fight [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2977.12s)]
*  In the face of like immense risk if you know, we'll see what happened if he was just shot [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2982.08s)]
*  I mean that that's a very ominous, you know warning sign maybe and maybe that was the intent we don't know yet [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2986.24s)]
*  Um, and yet to your point the u.s. Does provide a lot of assistance to uganda [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2992.08s)]
*  I mean it it's this needs to be more than just a kind of as you said perfunctory [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=2996.08s)]
*  Statement of concern and monitoring that you know, they're like as we talk about israel like that [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3001.3599999999997s)]
*  You know if you don't have consequences, uh, you know, you shouldn't expect a different result [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3005.8399999999997s)]
*  So yeah, I was just looking at bobby's twitter feed [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3009.52s)]
*  I mean they they have a video up where they said you can clearly hear someone yelling shoot him [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3011.7599999999998s)]
*  These security forces right before bobby was shot in the leg [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3016.24s)]
*  so I mean if that's the case you have to imagine the the [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3019.12s)]
*  Administration should be reviewing this [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3023.8199999999997s)]
*  Whatever the security force and whether they're receiving any direct u.s. Assistance because this is a pretty clear human rights violation [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3027.04s)]
*  Yeah, that cannot happen. So one will keep monitoring [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3033.04s)]
*  Also ben, I mean, you know, we talked about this in depth a couple weeks ago [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3036.64s)]
*  But the situation for women in afghanistan is just unbearable [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3040.56s)]
*  Um, there are new so-called vice and virtue laws published by the taliban that state that quote [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3044.42s)]
*  Whenever an adult woman leaves her home out of necessity. She is obliged to conceal her voice face and body [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3049.86s)]
*  So that means women can never show their face. They can't speak. They can't read or sing in public [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3055.78s)]
*  This is obviously, uh an attempt to stamp out women from public life entirely not let them exist [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3061.54s)]
*  Uh, but one incredible thing that's happening is that women are are doing what they can to be defiant [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3067.14s)]
*  Uh, there's clips going up on social media of afghan women singing publicly. Um, here's a clip [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3072.26s)]
*  Reminds me of the protest movement iran when you know, just sort of [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3091.78s)]
*  Basic acts like walking around with your hair uncovered or singing publicly or releasing a song or viewed as acts of defiance [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3094.9s)]
*  Um a couple weeks ago. I referenced this a minute ago. You spoke with [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3102.02s)]
*  Sahar haalemzai from the malala fund who made a point of noting that their fight for women's rights [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3105.7000000000003s)]
*  Is most forcefully coming from women in afghanistan themselves who are risking their lives to do so [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3110.7400000000002s)]
*  Um, these laws though, they're not just targeting women [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3115.78s)]
*  Taxi drivers are forbidden from giving rights to women without a male escort [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3119.2200000000003s)]
*  Women are not supposed to befriend other women. So it's clearly [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3123.3s)]
*  Uh a process that is an effort to essentially [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3127.2200000000003s)]
*  Criminalize being a woman in society that is not just trapped in your home from the Taliban. Yeah and to the point about [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3130.8s)]
*  Sahar when she was on she talked about you know, this is gender apartheid and [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3138.1000000000004s)]
*  and the reason I think that's a useful paradigm is [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3143.1400000000003s)]
*  it kind of [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3146.1800000000003s)]
*  Globalizes the issue right in the sense that [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3148.0800000000004s)]
*  um, you know, I would hope a kamal harris administration [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3150.98s)]
*  You get a sense that because the afghan withdrawal didn't go particularly, you know, well obviously [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3154.92s)]
*  The biden team kind of low profiles the issue of afghanistan a bit [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3159.64s)]
*  I think kamala could come in and make a kind of renewed push on [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3163.64s)]
*  the issue of women in afghanistan [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3167.4s)]
*  You know off of these laws among other things but also kind of globalize it to this, you know [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3169.56s)]
*  She can be a spokesperson as she has been in this country on gender equality for you know, gender abuse gender apartheid [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3173.88s)]
*  You know around the world and afghanistan and iran are probably the two most prominent places for it [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3181.16s)]
*  The other thing that stands out to me tommy on, you know, what was pretty bleak day [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3185.8s)]
*  but in each of these stories like there are [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3189.64s)]
*  There really are these kind of heroic people like afghan women, you know risking everything to be heard and to kind of assert their humanity [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3192.52s)]
*  all the way back to the hostage families in israel pushing for a ceasefire to the [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3200.12s)]
*  medical workers in Gaza to be a palestinians to [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3205.24s)]
*  You know tom talks about you know people in sudan what they you know, there are good guys out there, you know, bobby wine [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3209.16s)]
*  you know, um and many of them are risking a lot, you know, and and you just feel like we're in this period where [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3215.3999999999996s)]
*  You know the stakes are big because everybody knows that there's a lot on the line everywhere, you know [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3222.12s)]
*  Yeah, and you know sort of back to the conversation we had about gaza where the political discourse in the u.s [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3227.0s)]
*  Is just the dumbest version of yeah what we should be talking about [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3231.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean there's been a controversy over the last few days and weeks about the trump administration or the trump campaign [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3234.7599999999998s)]
*  Trying to highlight the three-year anniversary of the withdrawal from afghanistan [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3242.2799999999997s)]
*  By having trump go to arlington national cemetery with a bunch of his goons on his campaign team [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3246.7599999999998s)]
*  To film essentially an attack ad or campaign video or tiktok which is against the rules at arlington [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3252.68s)]
*  You're not like section 60 is this like hallowed part of arlington [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3259.72s)]
*  It's where the post 9 11 [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3263.4s)]
*  uh [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3265.7200000000003s)]
*  The where people killed in post 9 11 wars are buried [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3267.08s)]
*  And you were not supposed to film things there. It doesn't matter if you have permission from a family [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3271.2400000000002s)]
*  It's just a place that it that's treated as hallowed ground and trump went there with a bunch of videographers [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3276.6800000000003s)]
*  And apparently got into one of them got into a scuffle with someone who works at arlington [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3282.12s)]
*  and they posted all these videos of him there anyway, including a photo of trump like [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3287.8s)]
*  Giving a thumbs up. Yeah. Yeah at the graveside [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3292.6s)]
*  Yeah, like he was meeting the head of some like local rotary club in the oval office, you know [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3295.56s)]
*  Yeah [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3299.96s)]
*  I mean he's with some of the families a family of someone who was killed at the abbey gate attack during the withdrawal from afghanistan [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3300.2000000000003s)]
*  And so clearly the the those family members wanted trump there. They appreciated whatever he's saying about you know [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3307.32s)]
*  Their son or daughter and so I respect that but again [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3314.6800000000003s)]
*  You're not supposed to create like political videos at arlington period and yet [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3317.88s)]
*  I don't know. It's like you would think this would be a campaign ending thing to do something that's hackish [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3323.4s)]
*  But trump is just able to get away with it and his campaign acts with such impunity when they're called out on this stuff [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3328.12s)]
*  Yeah, there's the obvious point of just you know [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3333.6400000000003s)]
*  If I told you you know 10 15 years ago that there'd be a guy who got caught [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3336.04s)]
*  You know trying to campaign in section 60 of arlington national cemetery [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3341.4s)]
*  And his campaign got in a fistfight with like the you know staffer from arlington national cemetery and then attacked his mental health [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3345.64s)]
*  And yeah, there's statements. I mean it just shows this guy's completely [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3353.0s)]
*  you know [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3356.84s)]
*  Missing in in any gene that should put him anywhere close to the presidency [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3358.52s)]
*  But the other point is the one you make which is part of what trump does [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3362.84s)]
*  Is he kind of reflects back the stupidity of how issues are covered in the united states? [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3367.08s)]
*  Because essentially he has no policy difference on afghanistan he negotiated the withdrawal that led to the kind of chaotic end of things [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3372.2000000000003s)]
*  Uh, it's not like he would have had some different, you know formula for protecting [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3379.8s)]
*  troops at the ibogate [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3384.36s)]
*  He just knows that that was a bad political week for joe biden [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3385.88s)]
*  And that the right wing has probably spent you know millions of hours attacking joe biden for the chaotic withdrawal from afghanistan [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3389.7200000000003s)]
*  And so he's not even like speaking to [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3397.0800000000004s)]
*  People's brains he's just kind of speaking to a media narrative, you know, like if I go out and talk about you know [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3399.64s)]
*  the withdrawal of afghanistan [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3405.08s)]
*  you know that's [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3407.08s)]
*  like in the funhouse mirror of american politics like that's and by the way [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3408.68s)]
*  He desperately still wants to be running against joe biden. Oh, absolutely because I don't think anybody thinks like kamala harris was responsible for the withdrawal [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3413.7999999999997s)]
*  So it's just it's it's it's pointless [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3419.72s)]
*  As well as being offensive for him to be doing this. Yeah, he tries to film a campaign ad at arlington [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3422.68s)]
*  His staff gets into a physical altercation with someone who works there who wants them just to obey the rules [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3428.36s)]
*  Then trump tweets out or truths out [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3433.88s)]
*  Uh quote it was a made-up story by comrade kamala and her misinformation squad that nonsense somehow leads these articles [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3436.04s)]
*  Yeah about what happens like what are we doing here? What are we doing? It's your point like it's clear to me that kamala harris [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3443.0s)]
*  Well, it's not clear to me by everything by all accounts everything i've read [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3448.76s)]
*  It's it's very clear that joe biden was the one who wanted to end the war in afghanistan for what I think are good and [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3452.68s)]
*  Honorable reasons it doesn't mean the rollout and their withdrawal went perfectly but the idea that like they can make this [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3458.9199999999996s)]
*  Lay this at harris's feet. I think it's nuts. It just shows you that they are living inside their own [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3465.08s)]
*  Media ecosystem, that's right. I mean because I just don't think this is even like let's say they pulled off [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3470.52s)]
*  Their campaign stop at arlington [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3475.08s)]
*  I don't think this is some giant winning issue where people are going to go into the voting booths thinking about the abbey gate, right? [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3476.7599999999998s)]
*  But it because they live inside of the cartoon version of this they've created they think it gets a lot more traction than it actually does [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3482.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right. Um [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3488.92s)]
*  Finally ben, uh last issue before we get to your interview. Um [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3491.16s)]
*  We have all heard people criticize so-called hashtag activism on the show. Um [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3494.6s)]
*  What I saw a tweet today that I think took it to a whole new level. It was from a guy named mark dubowitz [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3500.8399999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah, i'm so glad for talking about this [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3505.4s)]
*  He is the head of an organization called the foundation for defense of democracies, uh, this is the tweet [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3507.48s)]
*  Uh quote, please send me your actionable ideas on how to topple the regime in iran [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3514.04s)]
*  This is a major priority for me and at fdd [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3519.2400000000002s)]
*  I promise that as many of the good ones as possible will be put into action end quote. So [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3522.28s)]
*  Uh admittedly ben i've never toppled a regime from my home. Not on twitter. Yeah, presumably it involves killing a lot of people now [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3527.08s)]
*  I mean the thing okay, like this guy dubowitz is like the was like the worst version of a hackish, uh, [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3535.48s)]
*  iran deal opponent but also just you know [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3542.6s)]
*  Should we set the table on fdd? Yeah, let's give us your description of fdd. So fdd is called the foundation for the defense of democracies [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3545.88s)]
*  Um, and it's mainly been the hub for a certain kind of dc [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3553.56s)]
*  D [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3557.08s)]
*  That does the bidding of the gulf states some of whom fund the foundation for the defense of democracies, uh irony not intended [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3559.96s)]
*  and the israeli government, um [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3567.32s)]
*  Similarly, not exactly the most small d democratic crowd in the world [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3569.72s)]
*  and they've kind of [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3573.56s)]
*  Just driven like the most hardline anti iran agenda possible like sanction after sanction [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3574.84s)]
*  And and again another theme of this day's show [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3580.68s)]
*  Tommy which I regret to some extent is media criticism [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3583.96s)]
*  Because i'm not you know, i'm not one of these people that thinks somehow magically [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3588.04s)]
*  Like the the mainstream liberal media quote unquote can you know erase trump from our politics by having stoner headlines? [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3592.04s)]
*  But the thing about dubowitz is he's credibly quoted in like almost every article [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3600.52s)]
*  This is the problem that you could ever read about iran as like an analyst and look that's literally like, you know [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3604.52s)]
*  He's always this guy is an advocate an activist for regime change, you know [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3609.96s)]
*  Like he's sitting there like just outing himself saying like i'm just sitting here [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3615.0s)]
*  All I do all day is think about how to like overthrow this government that that's not some dispassionate [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3619.7200000000003s)]
*  You know analyst of nuclear and sanctions related issues, right? [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3625.08s)]
*  That's a guy with like a lot of skin in the fucking game and he's you know foreign funded in some cases [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3628.2s)]
*  Yeah, the the fdd gets money from the biggest [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3633.96s)]
*  Bold name republican donors sheldon adelson paul singer [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3638.12s)]
*  Uh the home depot founder bernie marcus. It's that home depot guy's really nuts. Yeah, he's really out there [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3642.92s)]
*  I think he gave 10 million dollars someone don't tell tim waltz [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3648.36s)]
*  So these are like people that hate obama people that want to topple iran and people that have the kind of like right wing policy [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3651.0s)]
*  most right wing policy vision [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3656.92s)]
*  for israel and love bb and mbs love bb love mbs and [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3659.08s)]
*  I and just [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3664.12s)]
*  They create this organization that's just like pure astroturf that holds these, you know meetings or whatever [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3665.72s)]
*  But yeah, it gets quoted in the new york times all the time. It's just like an iranian. Yeah. Yeah [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3670.92s)]
*  And it's i'm with you like and why would anybody know that? [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3675.8799999999997s)]
*  You know anybody reading would be like oh this person's sitting in a think tank and they're like, you know [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3678.2s)]
*  But like they never identify like, you know, what the agenda is. Yeah, I find a lot of media criticism on social media like very [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3681.64s)]
*  tiresome and and just [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3688.74s)]
*  Like wasted energy like if you're yelling about a new york times headline all the time or like [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3691.22s)]
*  Why isn't the ed board called on trump to resign every single day? [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3696.3399999999997s)]
*  Like what are we doing here? [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3699.4599999999996s)]
*  But there are ways that the media gets manipulated and part of it is organizations like this [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3700.66s)]
*  Creating events and materials and op-eds and putting out people to shape the narrative in a certain way [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3706.66s)]
*  Yeah, it's an information. So it should be it should be presented as such. Anyways, do you have any good ideas for how to topple the regime? [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3712.74s)]
*  Um [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3720.02s)]
*  Let's see the [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3722.74s)]
*  um [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3725.22s)]
*  The thing that is actually helping prop up the regime is the perpetuation of all these like fdd type organizations, right? [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3726.18s)]
*  Because it gives the regime the enemy they need maybe take maybe we could take down the regime if we just got rid of all [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3731.86s)]
*  This astroturf. Okay, and the focus was actually on the nature of the iranian government to its own people instead of like, you know [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3736.58s)]
*  Fighting back against the mark dubovitz's of the world. Well, there you go mark free idea for you [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3743.38s)]

*  Here on the podcast since the violence broke out between two warring factions in april of 2023 [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3847.22s)]
*  More than eight million people have been displaced many tens of thousands have been killed [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3853.9399999999996s)]
*  And according to the un the world's largest hunger crisis has unfolded [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3858.8199999999997s)]
*  Today we're really pleased to be joined by [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3863.9399999999996s)]
*  The us special envoy to sudan tom perriello who's working hard to try to address this multifaceted catastrophe tom [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3866.74s)]
*  Thanks so much for being with us. Thank you so much for covering this ben. So just to begin with [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3874.1s)]
*  You recently wrapped up a round of u.s. Mediated talks in geneva [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3878.98s)]
*  I know you were focused on trying to open up some additional routes for humanitarian aid [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3884.26s)]
*  Can you talk a little bit about what happened in geneva and what's coming out of that? [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3889.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean we have a crisis that's just hard to wrap your head around when you're talking about [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3893.2200000000003s)]
*  You know 20 million people who've had to flee their homes and are facing acute hunger. You have a million facing starvation [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3897.94s)]
*  I was on a call [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3904.5800000000004s)]
*  Sunday with some of the regional sudanese coordinators of these local food kitchens and in the process of the 90 minute call [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3906.5s)]
*  Three of the volunteers were killed in shellings [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3913.46s)]
*  Just during that period it's a it's a matter of just horrendous life and death and terror every day [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3917.46s)]
*  Particularly for women who are facing both starvation and rape as a weapon of war [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3924.1s)]
*  And this is 16 17th month of the conflict [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3930.02s)]
*  We had had a difficult time getting talks started because one of the sides the army did not want to attend [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3933.46s)]
*  And frankly one of our co-hosts didn't seem to want to host [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3939.3s)]
*  And so president biden and secretary blinken gave us the green light to try something [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3943.38s)]
*  A bit creative and we ended up with what was a combination of in-person [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3947.7s)]
*  proximity and hybrid or virtual talks [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3953.78s)]
*  So we basically had a group in switzerland that included [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3956.9s)]
*  Some of the best humanitarian aid and ceasefire experts in the world [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3960.5s)]
*  Some key countries from the region the un the african union and we would get together in the morning and hear okay [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3963.78s)]
*  Where the road's getting stocked where are we not getting food through? [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3969.7000000000003s)]
*  Okay to break through that what do we need? We need this from the rsf. We need this from the army [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3972.7400000000002s)]
*  We need this from the chattie and government and then we would go out and basically work phones [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3977.3s)]
*  And work with the two warring sides but also the neighboring countries and try to try to get things done and we got [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3982.82s)]
*  Two routes open we've had over [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3989.1400000000003s)]
*  Seven million pounds delivered. We're stopped by rains the last two days [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3992.1800000000003s)]
*  We're getting a third route open [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3997.06s)]
*  And that's you know trying to get close to all 20 million people having food access that didn't you know at the beginning of last month [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=3999.3s)]
*  so [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4005.06s)]
*  This is such a multifaceted problem [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4006.26s)]
*  And as you mentioned you've got the sunni's armed forces fighting against the rsf this kind of warlord led [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4009.46s)]
*  Militia group then you've got the neighboring states who are dealing with both [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4018.1000000000004s)]
*  Incoming flows of people but also their [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4022.42s)]
*  Potential platforms to get aid in then you have all these external countries [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4025.2200000000003s)]
*  That are providing support to one side or the other [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4030.6600000000003s)]
*  Before we get into a couple of the specifics of that [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4034.02s)]
*  Um [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4036.9s)]
*  In your job, how do you who are you engaging? You know like what like because you're trying to improve the humanitarian situation [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4038.58s)]
*  Ultimately, you'd like i'm sure to pursue a political settlement [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4045.86s)]
*  But with all those actors just in your role as envoy like who do you find yourself interacting with? [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4049.06s)]
*  So we try to make sure i'm talking about a thousand soonies per week through [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4054.02s)]
*  Virtual communication there's still telecom to much of the country as well as refugee population that spread around [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4058.5s)]
*  Places I I go a lot at us. Cairo compala [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4065.14s)]
*  In tebe, Nairobi [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4070.2599999999998s)]
*  And so you have the Sudanese population that's very spread in addition to significant diaspora communities here in the us and europe [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4073.2999999999997s)]
*  Then in terms of the key regional actors, uh, it's again a lot all the neighboring countries are affected [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4080.74s)]
*  Whether by accepting refugees in many cases overlapping ethnic communities. That's you know, chad and and egypt and south sudan [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4086.58s)]
*  I've been to south sudan, but engaged there [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4094.74s)]
*  Eritrea, ethiopia, etc. Um, in fact, my nieces have been memorizing all the countries that border sudan [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4097.62s)]
*  But uh, then there are key players in the region, which is really in egypt, saudi arabia united arab Emirates axis [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4104.26s)]
*  uh, that's very central the african union, uh has been playing a key role in the [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4111.219999999999s)]
*  Political dialogue as well as supporting the talks that we were on [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4116.5s)]
*  So it's it's really a lot in the region and then back here [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4120.0199999999995s)]
*  It's an issue that still has strong bipartisan support on the hill [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4123.0599999999995s)]
*  both republicans democrats on the house and the senate have long had a [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4126.339999999999s)]
*  Deep engagement with sudanese people. So it's getting back meeting with the white house meeting with the hill folks. I'm up to new york tomorrow [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4130.66s)]
*  Um, so basically a lot of time on uh airplane tarmacs [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4137.0599999999995s)]
*  And when it comes just to the aid piece of it before we get into the politics, um, what is the is the impediment that? [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4141.219999999999s)]
*  Um, these groups are using, you know literal starvation as a weapon of war [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4149.06s)]
*  So therefore that that the two warring sides are actually just denying entry to assistance or how much of it is a logistical challenge of just getting [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4153.22s)]
*  Uh food to people who are in such need [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4162.1s)]
*  What why is it what is the biggest problem set to just feeding people who are on the brink of famine here? [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4164.42s)]
*  Yeah [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4170.42s)]
*  So it's a man-made famine and the answer of what got us to the to the famine conditions is different than what's keeping us in [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4171.14s)]
*  The famine conditions. So what got us there was primarily the rapid support forces burning all the harvests burning through the warehouses of food [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4176.58s)]
*  stealing the warehouses, uh, you know, um [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4183.46s)]
*  Robbing the convoys making it a very difficult area in which for humanitarian aid deliver [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4187.14s)]
*  Then once the rsf had taken a surprisingly large amount of territory [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4192.74s)]
*  um the army basically as a [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4197.46s)]
*  form of weak [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4200.5s)]
*  Muscle flexing said well, we're gonna uh do this note verbal where basically you say nothing can come across the adre border into some of the most [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4202.34s)]
*  Famine-stricken areas even though they have no actual de facto control over that border. Uh, there are hundreds of miles from it [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4209.62s)]
*  so, uh [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4216.900000000001s)]
*  And they said, you know, they were concerned about weapons coming across which would be a legitimate concern except for the fact that their note verbal [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4218.1s)]
*  Doesn't stop a single bad actor from coming across the border. Uh, the only thing it stops is un trucks [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4224.1s)]
*  And unfortunately, it's like kryptonite for un trucks. It's a 1300 kilometer border [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4230.34s)]
*  I used to sneak across it a bunch when I was doing documentation of darfor abuses many years ago [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4235.54s)]
*  It's it's a very porous border [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4240.820000000001s)]
*  and so this was clearly a decision by the [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4243.54s)]
*  staff and the government to say we want to starve these people that are in rsf territory in order to [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4246.900000000001s)]
*  You know fill in the blank to create that weakness that pressure to sort of suggest some sense of sovereignty over the country [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4253.7s)]
*  And the only people who paid the price for it were the most weak and vulnerable [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4259.94s)]
*  So for the last five or six months really that has been just a paralysis to the un system [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4263.78s)]
*  Um, uh because of the way that it tends to operate in countries [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4269.0599999999995s)]
*  um, so [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4273.54s)]
*  That was a big part of the negotiations in geneva was getting this showdown first with president burhan's permission [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4274.82s)]
*  To cross and then the rearguard action from the islamists and hardliners in his own government [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4280.98s)]
*  And so if there was any question that they were actively trying to starve people [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4286.34s)]
*  It was clear when they tried to undermine the president's decision to open this western border [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4289.860000000001s)]
*  Um that that that was that that was the intent so it's just been that now you have the rainy season [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4294.900000000001s)]
*  and so there are days where [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4301.14s)]
*  We can't trucks can't cross through because of the rains [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4304.02s)]
*  Uh, that was one of the reasons we wanted this breakthrough before the rainy season [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4306.9800000000005s)]
*  So there are natural limitations that will last several more weeks [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4310.26s)]
*  But it's been almost entirely man-made in terms of the crisis itself and the famine and when you look at the politics, uh, [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4313.78s)]
*  You know, there's uh, not a lot of good guys in this picture at all [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4320.42s)]
*  But you know the rsf in particular, you know has uh been engaged in you know [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4324.42s)]
*  Reported atrocities and as you mentioned kind of contributed to this kind of man-made humane hunger crisis [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4329.7s)]
*  the ua is coming in for kind of particular focus as a supporter in terms of [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4336.9s)]
*  Potential arms and resources to the rsf and there's been a lot of calls to try to utilize some greater leverage on the ua [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4341.7s)]
*  Or try to at least cut off that [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4348.02s)]
*  Um that that role that they're playing [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4350.42s)]
*  Uh, what how do you approach that? [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4352.9s)]
*  um, you know, is there a way to leverage external parties that are contributing and arming, uh, [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4355.62s)]
*  The factions fighting in sudan as a pathway to a political solution [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4363.06s)]
*  Well, I sure didn't have a macklemore as hero for sudan on my bingo card [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4366.5s)]
*  but uh, we'll come back to that he canceled a concert recently in abu dhabi and um, [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4371.0599999999995s)]
*  Standing in solidarity with sunni's people. Um, we have seen unfortunately a number of external countries, um [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4376.5s)]
*  Playing a very negative role in fueling this conflict, uh, whether that's uae iran russia and others [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4382.74s)]
*  Um, and we see unfortunately more of those actors coming in at this point [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4388.98s)]
*  As you mentioned the rapid support forces really has its roots in the janjaweed militias [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4394.5s)]
*  that were [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4399.860000000001s)]
*  infamous in the [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4400.96s)]
*  030405 period and conducting the genocide against the [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4402.96s)]
*  Various african tribes of western darfur the fur the masolite the zagawa [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4406.26s)]
*  Um, and it's both true that this is the the they are the inheritors of that but they're also more than that [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4410.5s)]
*  They became a multi-billion dollar gold corporate enterprise and an active mercenary group [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4416.740000000001s)]
*  To other actors so they came into this war [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4423.38s)]
*  Much more funded and battle-hardened I think than the army had realized which is part of why [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4426.02s)]
*  Uh, you have seen you've seen several rounds of military victories by [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4431.38s)]
*  This militia group against the established army [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4437.78s)]
*  Um, but it's all power. It's just about power. Um, you know, the the people rose up into 2019 [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4440.58s)]
*  It's incredibly inspiring revolution to throw off decades of the basheer [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4446.9s)]
*  Regime and and all of that repression to have their democratic future [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4452.18s)]
*  World was inspired. Um, and there was a temporary, you know power sharing with the military and the military [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4456.42s)]
*  For all of its complaining about the rsf [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4462.9s)]
*  Uh, it was the military that brought the rsf, uh in uh to sort of legal status and it was the military that joined forces with them [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4465.22s)]
*  Uh for a coup essentially against the civilian transition and then they couldn't agree on the power between the two of them [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4472.9s)]
*  There's an ethnic overlay of them being two separate [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4479.139999999999s)]
*  arab ethnic groups, uh, the one that runs the military traditionally looks down on [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4482.74s)]
*  The other and doesn't let them in the country club and then both of them have traditionally [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4488.179999999999s)]
*  Been very repressive of the african tribes around the peripheries [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4492.58s)]
*  So there are all these different elements of the war that you can come in on it [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4495.62s)]
*  But at its essence, it's a question of whether [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4498.9s)]
*  Which of these groups wants to have total power over the country and the clearness that the people don't want that they want a democratic [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4501.78s)]
*  Second inclusive future [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4508.02s)]
*  And they're looking for the u.s to be an ally on that and president biden has stepped up and and tried to do what we can [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4509.780000000001s)]
*  And just in terms of you know reaching some, you know political solution, no matter how distant that may appear on the horizon [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4516.42s)]
*  is that [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4523.780000000001s)]
*  You know kind of power sharing negotiation among, uh these uh, you know warring factions the sudanese armed forces and the rsf [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4524.820000000001s)]
*  Um, is it some kind of external framework that is like imposed on sudan? What do you see as the most likely? [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4532.74s)]
*  Uh pathway even if it may still be a long shot towards a political resolution in some ways [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4539.46s)]
*  The nice thing here is that the simplest solution is also the right solution, which is to just restore the civilian transition [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4544.26s)]
*  Um, people want a unity civilian government. Um, there's almost total [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4550.18s)]
*  Consensus on that among the sudanese people north southeast and west [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4554.42s)]
*  Um, they want that to be essentially a caretaker government until elections. Um, and um, that's [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4558.18s)]
*  That it's really the only way through the the standoff militarily right now as well [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4565.62s)]
*  um [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4571.0599999999995s)]
*  I think that the um, the challenge is that people oppressive groups don't tend to give up power voluntarily [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4572.42s)]
*  um, and so there's this question of what gets back to that particularly since [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4579.78s)]
*  The established military has gotten, um pretty crushed militarily into a smaller number of states [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4584.660000000001s)]
*  Nobody wants to see the rsf win and take political power [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4590.9800000000005s)]
*  Now they're claiming that they will hand power over to a civilian unity government the the second they win [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4594.740000000001s)]
*  Uh, but outside of the last seat of gladiator, you don't see that happen very often [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4600.5s)]
*  So I think we're not going to bank on that, uh that solution. Um, but I think the people do want [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4604.02s)]
*  That path to power they want to see these guys step down. They do [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4610.1s)]
*  Want to see a you know, a unified professional military over time [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4614.02s)]
*  But unfortunately right now we see more fracturing in ways that are continuing to increase suffering at a just unspeakable level [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4617.860000000001s)]
*  And one other thing I wanted to cover with you tom is um, and look this is such an important issue from a humanitarian perspective [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4625.780000000001s)]
*  You know arguably the biggest uh humanitarian crisis in the world [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4632.580000000001s)]
*  It's at a really kind of pivotal piece of geography for the global economy for the flows of people [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4636.9800000000005s)]
*  Has potential to further destabilize politics in europe because of the the politics of refugees there [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4644.02s)]
*  um [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4649.78s)]
*  And yet, you know you mentioned darfur in my memory [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4650.74s)]
*  You know, there was a massive saved darfur movement that kind of entered popular consciousness [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4654.1s)]
*  You and I have crossed paths a lot over the years, you know, you were in congress [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4658.34s)]
*  You were at the center for american progress you were [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4661.46s)]
*  Um, you know helping to lead the open societies foundations. So you've been doing you've done movement building in politics as well as policy [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4663.86s)]
*  Why do you think there? [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4671.94s)]
*  Hasn't been the same kind of public awareness of this issue as we saw safe with darfur [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4673.7s)]
*  And and what would you say to people who are listening who want to do something? [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4680.259999999999s)]
*  You know, they want to get involved or they want to donate or they want to you know, [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4683.219999999999s)]
*  Have their voices heard. I mean, how do we generate more public awareness and mobilization around this? I'll tell you it's a it's a great question [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4686.9s)]
*  Ben i've never [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4693.139999999999s)]
*  Been a part of a crisis of this scale that gets so little attention [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4695.139999999999s)]
*  Um, and particularly when you contrast it to when I was in darfur 20 years ago and [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4700.26s)]
*  Uh, again, it was every campus, uh, every celebrity [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4706.34s)]
*  Um people were engaged and they should have been engaged. It was a horrific genocide happening and unfolding [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4710.74s)]
*  Uh in front of our very eyes. Um, and here we have [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4715.86s)]
*  A similar crisis. We've already had ethnic cleansing. Uh, we've had crimes against humanity [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4720.179999999999s)]
*  Uh, there are some who've reached the conclusion of genocide [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4724.98s)]
*  Uh, and yet it's um, it is just almost total silence from the world community [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4728.099999999999s)]
*  And sure, you know the racism of coverage of africa or lack of coverage of africa comes to mind [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4733.22s)]
*  But we've had trouble even getting the african press to cover this [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4739.139999999999s)]
*  um, it doesn't seem to fit a neat narrative of um good versus evil [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4742.66s)]
*  I think uh, if I may say for me compared to my nieces and nephews, you know [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4748.58s)]
*  Our generation had a lot of interest in atrocity prevention [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4753.3s)]
*  Um, never again kind of mentality and now I think the anti-imperialist if the u.s. Isn't the bad guy. It's a little less [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4756.92s)]
*  Uh interesting so there's some element of that [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4764.36s)]
*  You know, it's a cultural issue too where it's an arabic speaking country. There's always the question of is it more [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4767.24s)]
*  arab or african the complexity of the conflict, um, [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4773.08s)]
*  And I think some just exhaustion and heartbreak with sudan over the years [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4777.48s)]
*  Um, and then I think it comes to some of the solutions which is people say, okay [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4781.799999999999s)]
*  What can we be for? [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4786.28s)]
*  and we have just lost the debate generationally on things like responsibility to protect or anything related to [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4787.88s)]
*  uh the idea that either the african union or the united nations would be prepared to [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4794.759999999999s)]
*  Uh intervene and be part of the solution and we don't tend to want to see that through u.s. Unilateralism [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4800.04s)]
*  So there's a whole set of tools that are off the table. Yeah, that being said, um, [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4805.16s)]
*  People can go to something like mutual aid sudan.org, which is one of the platforms that's supporting these [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4809.48s)]
*  Emergency response rooms which are sudanese youth who've come up with these created cash apps in a jose andre type model of local kitchens [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4815.88s)]
*  That was the call I was on where three of their volunteers died in 90 minutes [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4823.5599999999995s)]
*  This is the real thin end of the spear kind of delivery of aid in some of the hardest hit areas [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4827.16s)]
*  Um, you know, there's certainly groups amnesty and human rights watch and others that you know are continuing to try to push on arms [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4833.16s)]
*  embargo and other needs [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4839.16s)]
*  But again, we we just have not seen anything like the kind of response that you would imagine to the worst humanitarian crisis on earth [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4841.88s)]
*  Yeah, well look I think uh, those are good tips for how to people can get involved and I think just following this work and and [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4849.8s)]
*  and you know [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4857.08s)]
*  Raising your own voices on it is really important tom [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4858.68s)]
*  Uh, really appreciate all the work you and your team are doing and thanks for walking us through so much in a relatively brief period [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4861.16s)]
*  Time here. Well, thank you for giving susan some coverage and thanks to president biden and secretary blinkin for um, you know [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4866.76s)]
*  Giving us some room to lead on this. Thanks again to tom perriello for joining the show [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4872.280000000001s)]
*  And I think that's it for us [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4876.280000000001s)]
*  That's it. And I think i'm I think i'm out next week. Oh, right. You're on vacation. No, wait [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQbHWwQeyHo&t=4878.04s)]
