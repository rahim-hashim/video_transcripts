*  We are going to talk about the latest on the humanitarian situation in Gaza and reports that Israel may soon launch a ground invasion [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=16.76s)]
*  the US response the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=23.32s)]
*  Genuinely crazy [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=25.68s)]
*  Republican response that we're seeing to all this the pro-palestine protests that are happening around the globe [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=27.0s)]
*  The latest on how the intelligence community thinks the Hamas attack went down and was not [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=32.44s)]
*  Caught in advance in the political reaction in Israel and then we're gonna take some great questions [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=38.44s)]
*  About Hezbollah about Iran about a bunch of stuff from the Pod Save the World discord community [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  Thank you guys again for submitting those and if you want to join that [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=49.08s)]
*  Conversation or sending questions or anything go to Kirkett comm [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=52.56s)]
*  Friends. All right, Ben, you want to turn to Gaza first? Yeah [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=57.28s)]
*  Yeah [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=60.32s)]
*  Okay [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=60.72s)]
*  So it has been nearly a week since Hamas launched this terrorist attack on southern Israel that killed over 1,300 Israelis [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=60.84s)]
*  The vast majority of whom were civilians including women and children [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=66.8s)]
*  We're recording this at about 2 p.m [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=70.16s)]
*  Pacific time on Friday, October 13th and it seems like Israel is on the cusp of beginning a ground invasion into Gaza [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  There has been this major Israeli military buildup near the border with Gaza [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=78.83999999999999s)]
*  There have been over 6,000 Israeli airstrikes since last Saturday [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=83.08s)]
*  The Palestinian Health Ministry says about 1800 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed since the war started and thousands more have been injured on [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=86.75999999999999s)]
*  Friday the Israeli military will calm the IDF for short going forward [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  Told people in northern Gaza about 1.1 million people to evacuate to the south [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=99.12s)]
*  The United Nations says that is impossible that it'll create a humanitarian disaster [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=104.22s)]
*  Some Gazans have started evacuating others have refused Hamas says the evacuation order is fake propaganda [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=108.72s)]
*  They've urged people to ignore it [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=114.72s)]
*  Human Rights Watch called out Israel for reportedly using white phosphorus munitions in Gaza and in Lebanon [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=116.6s)]
*  White phosphorus is an incendiary weapon that can leave people with horrific burns and also obviously starts fires in civilian areas [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=122.36s)]
*  There's reports that Israel has conducted limited cross-border raids into Gaza to take up militants to look for hostages [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=129.68s)]
*  There are growing calls for Israel to open a humanitarian corridor in Gaza [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=136.22s)]
*  So civilians get access to food and water and fuel then historically speaking Israel is really prioritized getting back hostages [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=140.26s)]
*  This time around I'm seeing really scary background quotes from government officials saying things like, you know [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=147.57999999999998s)]
*  Defeating Hamas has to take priority [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=153.62s)]
*  over hostage rescue [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=156.06s)]
*  Netanyahu said every Hamas member is quote a dead man [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=157.94s)]
*  Benny Gantz said it's time for war and that the government was ready to wipe this thing called Hamas off the face of the earth [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=160.94s)]
*  So, you know, I think as we've discussed like totally understandable [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=166.34s)]
*  emotion here [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=170.3s)]
*  But I think the question still remains [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=171.66s)]
*  How what is the end game? Is this a plan for revenge or you know? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=174.38s)]
*  Is there something hopefully behind the scenes? Obviously, they wouldn't tell us in advance [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=180.42000000000002s)]
*  But what is the plan for getting the hostages released? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=183.78s)]
*  defeating Hamas and [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=187.54000000000002s)]
*  Limiting civilian casualties that we still don't know [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=189.54s)]
*  Well, I think the point is that those three objectives are in tension with each other [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=192.1s)]
*  Yeah, right and and do you know it bears repeating that? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=197.22s)]
*  We have to recognize that Israel is in a profoundly kind of traumatized state [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=202.01999999999998s)]
*  Their casualty count continues to go up the reports of Hamas atrocities continue to dominate [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=207.22s)]
*  Israeli society and and and here as well [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=215.06s)]
*  Understandably and that that has led to [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=219.02s)]
*  Both the desire for revenge and and for security for Israel [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=221.70000000000002s)]
*  But to those questions of hostages of how to deal with Hamas of how to limit civilian casualties [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=226.86s)]
*  Those are all the trade-offs that they're gonna be making as they make a decision about what this ground invasion is [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=233.10000000000002s)]
*  It seems like there's certainly going to be a ground invasion that the tanks are at the border [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=239.34s)]
*  The reserves have been mobilized all of the messaging suggests that they're about to go into Gaza [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=244.06s)]
*  If and I should add [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=250.34s)]
*  They are this has been different than previous Gaza Wars already like the pace of airstrikes [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=252.7s)]
*  We're talking 6,000 airstrikes in just a few days [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=259.38s)]
*  That is a pace and scale of airstrikes. It is much bigger than even the previous four Gaza Wars, you know if they go in [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=262.86s)]
*  Overwhelmingly to try to to destroy Hamas as they said [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=271.5s)]
*  With with that as the objective, you know your capacity to I don't know frankly how you deal with the hostage situation because [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=277.18s)]
*  Essentially Hamas is more likely than not has those hostages in civilian areas in areas spread out everywhere [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=285.65999999999997s)]
*  They're spread out and unless we have very good intelligence on exactly where they are [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=291.9s)]
*  It would seem like the hostages themselves might be at risk from an overwhelming bombardment and ground invasion now, you know, obviously [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=296.82s)]
*  I'm sure every intelligence resource is being spent on trying to find places where the hostages are and there could be some special forces [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=304.14s)]
*  maneuver there, but [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=311.78000000000003s)]
*  You know and then civilian casualty front again a massive ground invasion [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=313.82s)]
*  with the kind of bombardment that we've seen is going to be you know, pretty [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=319.66s)]
*  Catastrophic in terms of civilian casualties and there's both I think the question that was raised by the the UN [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=324.58s)]
*  announcement around the 1 million [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=331.53999999999996s)]
*  Palestinians that they were calling to move [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=333.7s)]
*  It calls into question [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=336.5s)]
*  Whether they'll there could also be mass displacement of Palestinians [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=338.61999999999995s)]
*  Which in the Palestinian historical memory, of course, you know, that is their most traumatic event because [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=343.9s)]
*  Essentially the Palestinian refugees who were displaced, you know around Israel's founding and in other times have not been able to return [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=350.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you're getting people call this the second Nakba, which is why they say they won't leave their homes [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=357.06s)]
*  That's exactly right. And so if you have a million people pushed into Egypt, I think their their assumption is [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=360.34s)]
*  I'll never be able to go home and I'll just become you know [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=366.58s)]
*  I'll become like the Palestinians who've been stuck in Lebanon or in Jordan and and so this is an incredibly challenging time [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=370.94s)]
*  And and the scale of what Israel chooses to do [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=378.3s)]
*  Is going to determine a lot of things. I mean that this is the moment to think hard about [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=381.90000000000003s)]
*  What the objectives are how heavy you want to go in and whether you want to do things that put at risk the hostages [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=388.22s)]
*  whether you want to [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=394.38s)]
*  Actually displace, you know, potentially a million or more [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=396.34000000000003s)]
*  Gazans or whether there can be something that is a more limited type of military operation [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=400.02s)]
*  It feels like the momentum in Israel is towards the more maximalist objectives [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=404.90000000000003s)]
*  And that's you know, we are raising skepticism both out of concern for Palestinians [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=411.38s)]
*  But also out of concern for for Israeli and Israelis and strategic consequences of that [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=415.42s)]
*  Yeah [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=419.82s)]
*  I mean part of this is about the the efficacy of any sort of military operation the risk to the IDF [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=420.18s)]
*  Soldiers who will go in you could see hundreds of thousands killed if we're talking about sustained urban combat for a long time [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=425.82s)]
*  You know, there's also frankly some scary kind of dehumanizing language being used by Israeli officials Israeli president [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=431.82s)]
*  Herzog said it is not true. This rhetoric about civilians were not aware. We're not involved is absolutely not true [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=439.29999999999995s)]
*  They could have risen up against that evil regime that took over Gaza and a coup d'etat [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=446.14s)]
*  He goes on, you know to say more in that quote. I don't have the full one in front of me [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=450.29999999999995s)]
*  But you know, that's disconcerting [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=453.21999999999997s)]
*  there have been some sporadic clashes in the West Bank already between [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=455.34s)]
*  Palestinians there and security forces [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=459.94s)]
*  There's 70 people were killed after an Israeli airstrike hit three convoys of evacuees trying to leave northern Gaza [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=461.65999999999997s)]
*  So even that you know sort of planned the the ordered evacuation the Israelis announced is not safe for people [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=468.5s)]
*  There's also I just saw coming here been a horrifying video [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=474.46s)]
*  Circulating on social media of the moment in Israeli shell [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=479.02s)]
*  Landed on a bunch of international journalists covering these sporadic clashes in southern Lebanon killing a Reuters photographer [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=481.74s)]
*  Wounding six others. So this is spilling out and harming a lot of innocent people very quickly [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=488.54s)]
*  There's two pieces to the rhetoric that I think are worth watching here [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=493.74s)]
*  The first is the kind of bougie Herzog point that the people of Gaza are somehow responsible [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=497.66s)]
*  for not rising up, you know that that kind of [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=504.38s)]
*  Recategorizes essentially the people of Gaza in more of a combatant place than in treating them as civilians [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=509.09999999999997s)]
*  And that obviously could lead to more indiscriminate use of violence in Gaza [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=516.14s)]
*  And then also you see this, you know refrain this is not not human [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=521.02s)]
*  They're barbarians there, you know that it [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=527.6999999999999s)]
*  It entirely applies to the behavior of Hamas [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=531.66s)]
*  Like like like the Hamas's behavior what they did that pogrom that massacre that war crime that mass atrocity [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=534.9799999999999s)]
*  They committed all of that language [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=542.78s)]
*  You know can I think describe that behavior? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=545.54s)]
*  The problem is when it bleeds into describing kind of the people of Gaza, right? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=548.8199999999999s)]
*  and and I just hope that there is [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=553.8199999999999s)]
*  An effort to kind of separate these two out even the point about Isis [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=557.3s)]
*  What they did was absolutely reminiscent of Isis the military wing of Hamas is absolutely behaving as Isis [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=562.0600000000001s)]
*  But Gaza is not the caliphate, you know, like that's the distinction [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=568.14s)]
*  It's a it's a seemingly subtle but like it basically gets at are the two million people that are guilty or is Hamas [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=572.7s)]
*  Something that needs to be separated out from them. Yeah, that's not easily done militarily [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=579.86s)]
*  But I do think there are alternative military strategies that simultaneously try to relentlessly target Hamas [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=584.14s)]
*  And it might try to mobilize resources maybe from the Arab world [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=590.58s)]
*  To try to change the game in Gaza to try to get rid of Hamas and build something different, you know [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=594.3000000000001s)]
*  So there are other ways that I think are worth at least considering going about doing which is why you shouldn't rush [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=599.6600000000001s)]
*  In fairness Herzog he was serviced later. This meant the Gazans were legitimate military targets. He emphatically rejected that [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=605.38s)]
*  He's sort of pointing out the fact that because Hamas uses civilians and civilian infrastructure to strike Israel [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=612.5s)]
*  They have no choice but to operate in those areas. That is fair. That is true [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=618.18s)]
*  But the other part of that quote is very sort of ominous sounding we reached out to a journalist in Gaza named nor hasine [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=621.1s)]
*  She sent us this message describing what life is like in Gaza now and this you know [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=628.54s)]
*  Ordered evacuation of over a million people from northern to southern Gaza [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=634.74s)]
*  This clip is a little longer than the clips we normally played in but we thought it was incredibly powerful and important [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=638.98s)]
*  For you guys to hear it. So here it is [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=643.8199999999999s)]
*  There is no airplanes the trains there is only cars and there is only two streets basically that are linking [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=645.86s)]
*  Gaza City with southern Gaza [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=655.5400000000001s)]
*  So most of the people who are lucky enough they would take cars [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=658.3000000000001s)]
*  And this is so rare nowadays because there is basically no fuel the cars and others are using [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=663.1400000000001s)]
*  Are walking basically on their foot [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=670.34s)]
*  I mean I saw today hundreds of people taking that route on their feet [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=672.62s)]
*  There is hundreds of thousands of people that decided to stay in their homes in central Gaza and northern Gaza [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=677.5s)]
*  Some of them [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=685.62s)]
*  decided to go to shelters and [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=687.4200000000001s)]
*  When we say shelters we mean UN schools or hospitals because there is no [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=690.22s)]
*  shelters basically in Gaza, but people think that [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=697.1800000000001s)]
*  Schools that belongs to the UN and [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=701.22s)]
*  Hospitals are the safest place for them to be in [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=705.26s)]
*  The infrastructure here in Gaza is totally damaged. We are facing problems with electricity the [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=708.82s)]
*  The internet would barely get Wi-Fi when we are in the hospitals [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=717.46s)]
*  The Wi-Fi lines in Gaza are all down [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=722.46s)]
*  We cannot even communicate with each other the lines are also down [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=725.82s)]
*  It's really bad and and this makes things even worse during evacuation because basically families cannot call each other and know [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=733.02s)]
*  What they're planning to do. My children are okay [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=741.62s)]
*  They are now [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=746.62s)]
*  Sleeping actually they were really tired [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=748.34s)]
*  Because they've gone through a very very rough night of ongoing Israeli a strikes [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=752.62s)]
*  Most actually of these strikes targeted the place that is just 300 meters away from where my children were residing [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=759.3s)]
*  I've been working as a reporter for like 12 years now, and I've seen [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=768.06s)]
*  injured children I've [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=772.74s)]
*  Seen dead children [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=774.86s)]
*  I've seen buddies that have been under the rubble for five and four days. I've seen a lot and [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=777.38s)]
*  This is what we're going through now is even worse. I [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=785.42s)]
*  cried a lot today I [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=789.7s)]
*  Keep it all together because this is the only thing [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=792.02s)]
*  That I should do I mean if I collapsed [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=796.34s)]
*  If I collapse if I [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=800.06s)]
*  If I am not as strong as I should be in a front of my children and [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=803.26s)]
*  In front of my family and in front of my parents. They will lose faith [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=808.34s)]
*  Because they put all of their faith in me. I take it as a responsibility of [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=813.8199999999999s)]
*  Telling the world what is really happening here on the ground in Gaza, so I [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=820.14s)]
*  Have no other choice so Ben and Nora and her two children are among those evacuating [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=824.18s)]
*  We also reached out to Mahmoud Shalabi. He's the acting Gaza director for medical aid for Palestine [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=829.2199999999999s)]
*  He has chosen not to leave his home. Here's a clip. There are people who started fleeing their homes [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=834.5799999999999s)]
*  It's true, but there are also people [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=839.62s)]
*  who are refusing to do so and refusing to [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=842.14s)]
*  Be part of a second Nakba [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=846.3399999999999s)]
*  What and I am one of those I [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=848.94s)]
*  Am NOT leaving my home. I am not going to [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=851.62s)]
*  Be a refugee again. I am already a Palestinian refugee [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=856.0600000000001s)]
*  This is not going to be repeated for me or anyone from my family. I understand the safety concerns [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=860.34s)]
*  I understand how it's going to affect many people, but I will not leave I will die [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=866.0600000000001s)]
*  I will die [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=871.86s)]
*  I understand how it's going to affect many people, but I will not leave I will die standing [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=874.1800000000001s)]
*  My existence in itself on this land is resistance and I am urging all the people of the free world [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=879.66s)]
*  To share this message with the people who care about humanity about dignity and about human life [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=887.46s)]
*  We will not go down tonight [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=895.66s)]
*  So then it speaks to the impossible choices that people are facing in Gaza [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=898.34s)]
*  You know, so what you mentioned earlier about people not wanting to become a refugee a second time [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=901.5799999999999s)]
*  But obviously also hospitals and people in them can't move they can't evacuate [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=904.98s)]
*  Yeah, I mean to put this in perspective [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=909.9399999999999s)]
*  Gaza's population is bigger than the population of Manhattan, right? I mean a lot of people have been in New York like to Manhattan. I mean [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=913.66s)]
*  I just try to imagine try to move all those people in a place where over 80% of people are in extreme poverty already [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=921.9s)]
*  There's not much infrastructure to speak of and that there have been six thousand bombs dropped and running out of gas and they're running and [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=928.22s)]
*  Fuels been cut off food water supplies have been cut off. So [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=934.86s)]
*  This is not a place where you can have an orderly, you know [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=938.94s)]
*  Movement of a million people, you know out of some harm's way and even if you did by the way [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=942.98s)]
*  Hamas is gonna move with those people, you know [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=949.2600000000001s)]
*  And so it's I don't know that if there's a full-scale effort in terms of a ground invasion and occupation of Gaza [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=951.66s)]
*  Ultimately anywhere in Gaza is not going to be safe. I think what I hope people can take away [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=960.86s)]
*  From those clips. These are not Hamas people, right? These are people, you know, we all were gutted [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=967.74s)]
*  absolutely gutted by [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=974.78s)]
*  What happened to the Israeli people and the innocent people whose lives were lost and the stories they told [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=976.6999999999999s)]
*  Israel of course like any government will want to defend its population [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=982.78s)]
*  We'll want to attack a group like Hamas that carried out an atrocity like that. But but we just have to bear in mind that [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=986.78s)]
*  These people are in the middle of this [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=994.1s)]
*  these innocent people are in the middle of this and again that [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=996.86s)]
*  We should be concerned about that but also [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1002.22s)]
*  Some flattening the whole city of Gaza [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1005.4200000000001s)]
*  Will transform that region forever, you know [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1008.02s)]
*  You could you could lead to escalatory violence wars Hisbua coming in regional conflicts in flame Arab opinion [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1012.02s)]
*  Israel isolated for a very long time. So [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1020.3000000000001s)]
*  This is the time to be careful about how how heavily Israel goes in. Yeah, very well said. Um, let's turn to [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1022.7800000000001s)]
*  the response from Washington [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1030.18s)]
*  Specifically President Biden so President Biden has gotten a lot of praise from the Jewish community in the US and from Israelis [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1032.22s)]
*  For his response to the tragedy in particular remarks [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1039.02s)]
*  He made to Jewish community leaders where President Biden talked about how he has taken all of his kids and grandkids to Dachau [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1042.0600000000002s)]
*  When they turned 14 for those who don't know Dachau was a horrific Nazi concentration camp [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1048.5800000000002s)]
*  I had you ever heard him tell that story. I had no idea and I you know, Joe Biden usually shares everything [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1052.66s)]
*  Story the few times. Yeah [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1057.74s)]
*  And I was yeah, I was surprised at that. Yeah secretary of state Tony Blinken [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1060.26s)]

*  Tony visited a relief center [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1083.06s)]
*  Incredibly moving moment there where he met a survivor who was at the music festival that was attacked [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1085.58s)]
*  He also delivered some remarks standing beside BB Netanyahu. Here's a clip from Tony I come before you [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1090.22s)]
*  Not only as the United States Secretary of State [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1097.7s)]
*  But also as a Jew [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1101.3799999999999s)]

*  So prime minister I understand on a personal level [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1123.3s)]
*  The harrowing echoes that Hamas's massacres carry for Israeli Jews [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1128.4599999999998s)]
*  indeed [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1134.1s)]
*  For Jews everywhere Tony also talked about how much this all impacted him as a parent [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1135.62s)]
*  As we sort of anticipated on Tuesday been Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin also went to Israel [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1140.2199999999998s)]
*  We're just texting with our friend Kelly who was on the trip. So it was incredibly powerful [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1145.58s)]
*  The Pentagon is surging military assistance to Israel [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1149.1399999999999s)]
*  Which I have read is more about contingency planning in the event that Hezbollah or someone else gets involved in really this fight in Gaza [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1152.1799999999998s)]

*  I think there's like 500 Americans in Gaza that we know about [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1169.42s)]
*  You know and then been more broadly. I mean in the US there is this very [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1172.94s)]
*  Eerie sort of pervasive fear right now, especially in the Jewish community that feels a lot like those days post 9-eleven [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1178.3400000000001s)]
*  That is I don't know. I think just really impacting people [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1186.94s)]
*  You're also seeing, you know, some progressives start to call for [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1190.9s)]
*  Biden to do more to urge caution to call for de-escalation call for a ceasefire potentially some of the House have called for a ceasefire [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1194.9s)]
*  The Biden administration though is still pointedly not saying any of that publicly [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1201.0600000000002s)]
*  You know, it's interesting that we you and I have been talking about this offline obviously the the the [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1205.3000000000002s)]
*  What Tony is speaking to right and he personally has this experience in his family and he's usually a pretty private guy and [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1211.38s)]
*  That's about as revelatory as you know [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1219.22s)]
*  You'll hear Tony be in public and I think that speaks to both how important that history is to him and his family [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1222.3s)]
*  I think Tony is in public service because of that history, you know, like there's kind of paid-forward [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1228.58s)]
*  mentality [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1235.5s)]
*  But also kind of speaking to the kind of trauma that is reawakened in people and look I'm not [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1236.74s)]
*  Stepping out of my depth here a little bit [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1243.3799999999999s)]
*  but I mean there is a deep-rooted trauma inside Jewish people and my mother's Jewish and I come from a [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1245.02s)]
*  European, you know Jewish family that has pogroms and and and it and the people that didn't come to United States [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1250.98s)]
*  You know, obviously or or or leave to other countries [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1257.1s)]
*  Obviously were in the Holocaust [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1262.22s)]
*  And so I do think that part of what is happening here is, you know [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1265.06s)]
*  This this kind of sense of trauma and vulnerabilities being awakened in the Jewish people [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1269.14s)]
*  Which is completely understandable given the scale of the atrocities we've seen [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1273.62s)]
*  I [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1277.58s)]
*  Think at the same time, you know, I remember 9-eleven. I I saw 9-eleven [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1278.94s)]
*  I was in New York and that transformed my life like I I went in national security. I mean [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1283.54s)]
*  Infamously, I was a creative writing grad student at the time. I was a driver. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah exactly and [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1289.06s)]
*  But witnessing that I was like I want to be a part of you know, the response to it and I remember [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1294.3400000000001s)]
*  Being in New York and there were some lefties I was at NYU, right? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1301.38s)]
*  Some lefties back in the day who were saying everybody's got to chill out and think twice before we start bombing Afghanistan [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1304.46s)]
*  And I I'll be honest like as a angry 23 year old. I was like, I don't want to hear that [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1311.3400000000001s)]
*  Like let's go fucking get these guys, you know, and that was the wrong mentality. I wish I wish you know [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1316.8600000000001s)]
*  Someone had come not that I was making decisions back then but but you kind of wish a friend came and said [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1324.6200000000001s)]
*  You better think really carefully about this if you start a war you don't know how it's gonna end, you know [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1330.26s)]
*  You you never know how a war is gonna end. It always ends up [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1335.22s)]
*  having consequences you don't expect and [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1340.26s)]
*  I do think as hard as it is for some people to hear this message [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1342.6200000000001s)]
*  Counseling some restraint counseling taking some time here counseling thinking this through [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1347.3000000000002s)]
*  Counseling being very careful to try to follow to follow the laws of war [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1351.8600000000001s)]
*  That is not a lack of regard for what Israel has gone through on the contrary [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1356.72s)]
*  It's kind of what I wish someone had done for the United States after 9-eleven because the decisions we made immediately [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1361.56s)]
*  Patriot Act in the way we went in Afghanistan and then a year later, we're still you know, we're going into Iraq [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1368.04s)]
*  You know, we all know what that led to and and so I do just think we can hold two thoughts in our head at the same time [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1374.36s)]
*  We can be horrified by what happened, but you know really early [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1381.12s)]
*  But you know really urging that this is thought through [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1385.1200000000001s)]
*  And look the die may be cast here by the time this podcast even airs, but that's why we're raising this [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1388.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, listen, I feel like we are watching a horror movie that we've all seen before, you know, horrific terrorist attack [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1393.92s)]
*  People are devastated angry scared all completely understandably and people want revenge again understandably. But what I'm praying is that [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1401.2s)]
*  Israelis, you know learn from the mistakes we made after 9-eleven don't repeat them [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1409.3200000000002s)]
*  I mean part one as you said part one is entering into a protracted bloody war with no clear goal or endgame [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1413.88s)]
*  But also, you know the broader 9-eleven policy response [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1420.9s)]
*  Yeah, the endless wars the civil liberties violations the list goes on and on and the one thing that is making me hopeful [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1424.0s)]
*  Ben is you know in the wake of 9-eleven Susan Songtag wrote that piece in the New Yorker [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1429.3200000000002s)]
*  I remember that like driven out of the country. Yeah, right the brutal honesty and criticism you're seeing of the Netanyahu government [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1434.3600000000001s)]
*  the [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1442.1200000000001s)]
*  Intelligence failure in places like Haaretz [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1443.44s)]
*  Makes me hopeful that like courageous sane voices [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1446.1200000000001s)]
*  Refused to not be heard and can have some influence [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1450.96s)]
*  I don't think it's gonna come from the United States [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1453.88s)]
*  But I do think internal Israeli voices are speaking up in ways that I wish more Americans [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1455.2800000000002s)]
*  Had felt they could in the wake of 9-eleven [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1460.16s)]
*  Yeah [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1463.1200000000001s)]
*  And in part because these issues have been debated for some time, right? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1463.52s)]
*  The treatment of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank and the absence of any political aspiration [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1466.52s)]
*  The the the only thing I can think about it from a hopeful note is [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1471.5400000000002s)]
*  You want to there is there is if you could get to a place with whatever military [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1477.0600000000002s)]
*  Operation takes place [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1485.46s)]
*  You would hope that on the back end of that [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1487.5s)]
*  You know, there will be a different Palestinian leadership [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1491.3400000000001s)]
*  I think that's for sure like 87 year old Mahmoud Abbas and and Hamas is gonna be sidelined [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1493.88s)]
*  Be being at now it seems like it's not clear to me how long he's gonna be prime minister [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1499.82s)]
*  We're gonna some pulling on the after yeah, and so maybe maybe like there can be some window that kind of opens up [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1505.46s)]
*  You know, sometimes after wars is when you make peace [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1513.34s)]
*  I'm not up. I'm being honest. I'm not optimistic about that [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1516.8999999999999s)]
*  Given where this is headed and given, you know the political direction of both the Israelis and the Palestinians [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1521.7s)]
*  But this cycle of violence [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1526.6599999999999s)]
*  It just creates more violence it begets more violence and more trauma and [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1530.6599999999999s)]
*  You something needs to arrested at some point. Yeah [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1536.1399999999999s)]
*  President Biden did do a press conference earlier today where he mentioned the need to protect civilians [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1539.6599999999999s)]
*  Let's let's play clip in my direction. Our teams are working in the region including [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1544.86s)]
*  The governments of Israel Egypt Jordan and other Arab nations and the United Nations to search support [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1549.78s)]
*  and humanitarian [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1556.74s)]
*  Consequences for Hamas attack to help Israel [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1558.74s)]
*  You know, we have to we can't lose sight of the fact that the overwhelming majority of Palestinians had nothing to do with Hamas [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1561.32s)]
*  And I'm also supporting attacks and they're suffering as a result as well [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1568.42s)]
*  So good is here by the least say that so, you know Ben once again this is a very important point [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1572.8999999999999s)]
*  So, you know Ben once again this is a very heavy very emotional episode [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1577.34s)]
*  So we're gonna give you all a quick reprieve. Yes into a segment about Republicans losing their fucking minds. Good. Good. Good [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1582.34s)]
*  Let's start with Donald Trump. Here's a clip and this is the little tell you this is a cut down from something [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1587.46s)]
*  That could be a lot longer, you know, hezbollah is very smart. They're all very smart [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1592.3799999999999s)]
*  The press doesn't like when they say but hezbollah. They're very smart. I'll never forget that [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1595.62s)]
*  BB Netanyahu let us down. That was a very terrible thing. I will say that they've got a straightened out [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1601.46s)]
*  Because they're fighting potentially a very big force. They're fighting potentially Iran [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1607.3799999999999s)]
*  and when they have [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1612.82s)]
*  People saying the wrong things everything they say is being digested by these people because they're vicious and they're smart and boy are they vicious [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1615.46s)]
*  Because nobody's ever seen the kind of sight that we've seen and they said gee [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1623.06s)]
*  I hope hezbollah doesn't attack from the north because that's the most vulnerable spot. I said, wait a minute [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1626.74s)]
*  You know hezbollah is very smart. They're all very smart. The press doesn't like when they say [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1633.46s)]
*  You know, I said that President Xi of China 1.4 billion people he controls it with an iron fist [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1637.3s)]
*  I said, he's a very smart man. They killed me the next day. I said he was smart. Whatever I get to say [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1642.6599999999999s)]
*  but hezbollah they're very smart and they have a [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1649.7s)]
*  National defense minister or somebody saying I hope hezbollah doesn't attack us from the north [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1653.5s)]
*  So the following morning they attacked [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1659.3799999999999s)]
*  They might not have been doing it. But if you listen to this jerk [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1661.78s)]
*  You would attack from the north because he said that's our weak spot. Yeah, I like when the people start to applaud him [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1665.54s)]
*  They're like what? [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1671.46s)]
*  I didn't even like the applause. I I [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1673.06s)]
*  Is amazing so trump saying hezbollah is smart. He attacks in yahoo. He calls the israeli defense minister a jerk [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1675.78s)]
*  Ben, do you think there's a chance that hezbollah attacked from the north because they're based in lebanon, which is north of israel [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1681.22s)]
*  Could that be what happened here? Yeah, I I don't think it was genius. I think it was like a geography and physics [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1688.02s)]
*  um [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1694.6599999999999s)]
*  What he said smart like 20 times 100 times? What is what briefing did he read about his bullet that? [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1695.54s)]
*  What classified documents did he take with him that uh, I don't know and he's clearly just mad at netanyahu [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1701.62s)]
*  Because he didn't go along with the election lie and because he congratulated biden when biden [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1705.6999999999998s)]
*  Legitimately won the election and it was called for him [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1710.1799999999998s)]
*  But he's just like he also truth quote the attack on israel would never have happened zero chance [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1712.58s)]
*  If the election of 2020 was not rigged and stolen so the world's biggest narcissist [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1718.1s)]
*  Rides again. It's all he can think about it. It doesn't you know, we are at this place where there's two wars now in ukraine and [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1722.6599999999999s)]
*  this one that you know could be more regional war in the middle east and [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1729.86s)]
*  That guy being in charge during like that kind of global instability is is a truly terrifying [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1734.1s)]
*  Uh thought truly, uh lindsey graham weighed in let's see a clip of that [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1739.9399999999998s)]
*  We're in a religious war here. I am with israel do whatever the hell you have to do to defend yourself level the place [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1744.34s)]
*  You know who wants a religious war hamas. Yeah, george bush weighed in [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1751.3s)]
*  Did his swaggering texas bullshit florida congressman brian mast wore an idf uniform to a republican caucus meeting [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1756.1799999999998s)]
*  Uh nicky haley the like supposedly sane one is out there saying [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1763.54s)]
*  Don't tell israel to stop don't call for restraint [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1767.62s)]
*  I mean it is really scary over there on the conservative side lindsey graham just always seems so gleeful in these kind of situations [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1769.94s)]
*  You can't wait to go on television and talk about a war and leveling places and killing people [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1776.02s)]
*  And and by the way saying this is a religious war is like the the most counterproductive fucking thing you could possibly say right? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1780.34s)]
*  Because yeah, it's it's I mean, I thought we learned talk about a 9-eleven lesson [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1785.54s)]
*  I thought you know, even george bush said it was wrong to say it was a crusade, you know, um, so let's [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1790.34s)]
*  I mean these people are so fundamentally unserious, you know, I mean it's [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1796.1s)]
*  It's bonkers dangerously stupid and george bush basically used the 9-eleven language. He's like I have with him or against him and yeah [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1800.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's all black and white. It was just [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1806.74s)]
*  Uh talking about I thought he'd learned through all this painting therapy that he's doing but I guess not [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1809.06s)]
*  Yeah, just go paint anything. I like just turn off the news go paint a picture of bb and yeah [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1812.98s)]
*  so [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1817.94s)]
*  Around the world then there have been huge protests most of them pro-palestine [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1818.98s)]
*  Uh in the arab world, you know, you're seeing protests in iraq lebanon yemen jordan many other places in france [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1823.16s)]
*  They banned pro-palestinian protests after the former leader of hamas called for protests [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1829.96s)]
*  In the uk the right-wing nutjob home secretary suela braverman warned demonstrators against waving the palestinian flag [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1836.2s)]
*  There's also been rallies in australia and a bunch of cities in the u.s. Etc. So, I don't know. I hope everyone listening is [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1844.04s)]
*  Offended by the idea of banning speech or banning protests that is dumb and ineffective [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1851.48s)]
*  that said, uh, just [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1858.1200000000001s)]
*  Quick flag for everyone out there planning a protest if your protest advertisement includes a photo [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1860.1200000000001s)]
*  Of the hamas guy on a hang glider. I think is the uh, university of washington college [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1864.68s)]
*  Pro-palestinian rally did uh, you're an asshole [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1871.0s)]
*  If your speakers condone [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1875.8s)]
*  Violence you are in fact an asshole you're setting back the cause of palestinian rights [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1877.56s)]
*  So this is how this works your right to free speech is absolute. You have the right to assembly [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1881.48s)]
*  We have the right to tell you you're a dumb asshole [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1885.8s)]
*  Yeah, like what the fuck is that about? You know, the whole hang glider thing. I mean, I don't ban protests [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1888.52s)]
*  No, don't be violent. Yeah, but absolutely if you if you want to talk about [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1893.48s)]
*  Palestinian statehood or support for people in gaza or support for the palestinian people generally, of course, that is good [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1897.7s)]
*  That is fine. That that is that look and there's also this [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1903.24s)]
*  You know movement to kind of cast this as some completely new woke phenomenon [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1907.0s)]
*  That's not the case like in the 60s and 70s and eight always there's always been student, uh movements [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1912.68s)]
*  That are sympathetic to the palestinians. I mean when I was in college [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1919.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, like this is not some new thing that happened just because of social media [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1922.28s)]
*  But what social media does is it allows you to take the biggest dumb fuckery out there like the the hang glider and say that [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1925.96s)]
*  That's everybody who's protesting right and that's just not that's not the case [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1932.36s)]
*  and look we should be [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1936.44s)]
*  We should be willing and open and able to have [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1938.44s)]
*  For some reason this issue is like the the hardest to discuss, you know [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1942.2s)]
*  openly, but that actually I think it [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1946.6s)]
*  It feeds the the hardening on both sides because if there's not a space to have conversation and protest and debate [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1950.04s)]
*  Well, then, you know people go into their corners and they believe that the other side is the worst version of themselves [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1957.16s)]
*  So if you are not at all supported the palestinians you believe that everybody that's sympathetic to the palestinians [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1962.2800000000002s)]
*  Is got like a hang glider, you know thing and if you're someone who is sympathetic to protesters [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1968.44s)]
*  You think that that everybody who is sympathetic to israel is like the worst version of the clip you heard [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1972.68s)]
*  From some far right person saying they want to eradicate palestinians and that's actually not the reality [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1978.2s)]
*  Most people are somewhere in the spectrum here [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1982.7600000000002s)]
*  But the only way we can experience that is if there is a place for for speech and protest and debate and dialogue [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1985.0s)]
*  And it's always going to be the case that a lot of young people [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1990.36s)]
*  Are are sympathetic to who they see as the underdogs. I mean, that's just as old as time [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1993.8799999999999s)]
*  and [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=1999.1599999999999s)]
*  Let's just hope that none of this, you know that the violence is obviously [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2000.1999999999998s)]
*  That that doesn't enter into it. Yeah for sure [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2004.6s)]
*  You know, it's interesting before this most recent conflict [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2007.24s)]
*  There was this debate about whether kind of the arab street is sort of the shorthand whether [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2010.4399999999998s)]
*  You know people have lost interest in the palestinian cause [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2016.04s)]
*  I think these protests are showing that there is still a lot of energy behind these movements [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2018.8400000000001s)]
*  I think it's maybe an open question about how much of that energy is, you know [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2023.96s)]
*  Pro-palestinian statehood versus just anti israel, right? You probably have a mix of both [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2027.22s)]
*  Um, I also saw ben that vladimir putin weighed in and he said that civilian casualties in gaza would be unacceptable [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2031.72s)]
*  So just you know want to keep you updated on the most cynical man on the planet's musings [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2037.8s)]
*  Yeah, but they're that the point is though that argument this is going to be turbocharged by russian [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2041.96s)]
*  Social media, you know, we the argument is going to be [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2047.48s)]
*  that the u.s [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2050.84s)]
*  Is totally hypocrite because you know, we raise these concerns about war crimes in ukraine and not there and not in gaza [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2052.2000000000003s)]
*  And so this is going to be part. This is the backdrop. This conflict has always got a global dimension [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2058.92s)]
*  you're the one who flagged for me to the [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2063.7200000000003s)]
*  the wisdom of henry kissinger coming into this which is essentially like [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2066.04s)]
*  Saying that this proves that germany should have let in any [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2069.4s)]
*  Any I guess refugees or immigrants because they they're supportive of palestinians like that. Thanks for weighing in [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2072.52s)]
*  Hank, yeah [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2079.7200000000003s)]
*  Once again just reminder to everyone that joe biden is the only president in modern history not to invite henry kissinger to the white house [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2080.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's a that's a definitely a notch another reason to vote for the guy [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2086.52s)]
*  Ben so, you know people in israel are still trying to figure out how this hamas attack happened and how the intelligence community there didn't catch it [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2090.52s)]
*  Uh ha arets reported today that the three idf observation balloons that had been used to monitor the gaza border [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2097.88s)]
*  Broke down in recent weeks and hadn't been repaired or replaced at the time of the attack [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2106.28s)]
*  The israeli government is examining whether hamas kind of took them out in preparation for this assault [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2111.2400000000002s)]
*  We're also seeing more and more clips about how hamas used [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2115.56s)]
*  Uh small cheap drones in these attacks. They dropped, you know munitions on tanks. They dropped them on observation towers [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2119.32s)]
*  They dropped them on a mechanical machine gun that apparently was used to sort of like fire at the border [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2125.88s)]
*  And took that out as well these videos. I think we're probably familiar to anyone who spends time on twitter and sees, you know similar [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2131.08s)]
*  Clips of like ukrainian military using kind of ad hoc military hardware like that [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2138.36s)]
*  Um, we mentioned you mentioned this earlier ben. So the jerusalem post commissioned a poll about the attack [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2142.84s)]
*  It found that 85 percent of respondents said that the hamas attack was a failure of the country's leadership [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2148.36s)]
*  56 said netanyahu must resign at the end of the war [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2154.44s)]
*  So, you know, we've been debating whether there would be a rally around the flag effect or whether people would blame bb [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2158.84s)]
*  Certainly post 9 11 we saw like the ultimate rally around the flag effect bush was at like what 91 approval or something like that [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2164.84s)]
*  But uh here it certainly seems that in the short term despite the fact that there's this unity government [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2171.08s)]
*  um, and probably near unanimous support for [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2176.36s)]
*  responding to hamas militarily [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2180.12s)]
*  Still over half the country wants bb to go that's that's hopeful [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2182.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and again, it just shows you that that is israelis [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2186.6s)]
*  You know in some ways have a more robust like, you know debate [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2190.7599999999998s)]
*  What they're doing to is they're holding two things in their head at the same time because what's interesting is they they are rallying around the flag [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2195.3199999999997s)]
*  And they're blaming bb, you know, like yeah, um, and that it's a complicated situation like there's [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2200.6s)]
*  The context does matter even though hamas is entirely responsible [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2206.52s)]
*  Like bb did let down his guard and move resources up to the west bank [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2211.1s)]
*  Uh, you know even again as hamas is responsible like there's there's a place to be able to digest that [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2215.66s)]
*  It will be interesting to see what happens in the coming days [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2223.34s)]
*  As the military operation unfolds [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2226.86s)]
*  And how durable that that support is for for bb whether it maybe goes up. Maybe it goes back down [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2229.34s)]
*  So it bears watching. Yeah, it does bear watching. Okay, so we'll take some questions from the discord chat here [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2234.94s)]
*  Again, kirkuk.com friends if you want to join and submit questions or to participate in the conversation [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2240.4599999999996s)]
*  so, uh [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2245.3399999999997s)]
*  Uh listener asks how much is there a connection between what has happened and the reporting of trump leaking israeli intelligence operatives? [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2246.2999999999997s)]
*  Or is it like everything else too early to tell i'm seeing a lot of this on twitter [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2253.02s)]
*  Um, I think this is referring to an incident in 2017 when trump reportedly told a bunch of russian officials [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2257.02s)]
*  I think it was serj labrov and the ambassador at the time [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2262.62s)]
*  about a [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2265.8999999999996s)]
*  What we have since learned was a covert israeli mission to penetrate isis [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2267.42s)]
*  An isis cell in syria that was developing bombs that we thought could evade airport security. I think there's probably zero [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2272.78s)]
*  Connection between what just happened with hamas in israel and that incident as much as people [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2279.56s)]
*  You know the resistance wants to blame trump and I get it, but I don't know what's your take [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2285.1s)]
*  Yeah, I don't I mean that was in, you know [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2288.7000000000003s)]
*  2017 um, and so the the possibility that some intelligence source [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2292.52s)]
*  That was compromised by that [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2297.1s)]
*  Disclosure by trump was relevant to an event in 2023 is pretty pretty minuscule to me [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2299.58s)]
*  Yeah, uh another listener asks a bunch of questions about hesbola kind of like what's hesbola? What do you think they're going to go to war? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2305.9s)]
*  um, and there was a [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2312.06s)]
*  Report in the post that was relevant to this so [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2313.98s)]
*  um [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2316.54s)]
*  They the washington post folks remember hey, they got the so-called discord leaks [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2317.42s)]
*  That was when this airman in massachusetts leaked all this highly classified pentagon stuff to a discord server that he was hanging out with on his with his friends [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2321.9s)]
*  This one this report about hesbola from february is a top secret u.s [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2329.98s)]
*  Intelligence document they assessed that a massive attack by hesbola was unlikely. That was obviously before this hamas incident [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2334.62s)]
*  In that historically speaking though hesbola and israel intended to clash in more limited proportionate ways [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2341.26s)]
*  So says this assessment. Um, just a quick one on one on hesbola [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2346.54s)]
*  They are a lebanon-based chiite militant group and political party [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2349.9s)]
*  hesbola emerged out of lebanon civil war in the 1970s the israeli invasion of lebanon in 1978 1982 [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2353.82s)]
*  When the israelis were going after the palestine liberation organization or plo [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2361.1800000000003s)]
*  So iran provides hesbola with a ton of money and weapons and training and they have since their inception [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2365.34s)]
*  Hesbola is responsible for the bombing of the u.s and french military barracks in beirut in 1983. They killed more than 300 people [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2370.1400000000003s)]
*  um like hamas [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2377.1000000000004s)]
*  Hesbola is committed to the destruction of israel, but they also have a larger sort of more sprawling set of ambitions and operations [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2379.66s)]
*  They operate in iraq and syria and yemen. They've done stuff in africa asia [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2385.98s)]
*  They've attempted things in the u.s. The state department says iran provides hesbola with about 700 million dollars per year [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2391.3399999999997s)]
*  So that's about 10x. I think what they provide hamas according to the state department [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2397.18s)]
*  But they also make money off of both legal and criminal enterprises. So they're kind of this weird hybrid thing [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2401.42s)]
*  And has was had a cabinet level position in the lebanese government since 2005 [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2407.1s)]
*  So ben any further thoughts on sort of like what what the deal with hesbola is and you know your thoughts [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2411.4199999999996s)]
*  Today about the possibility that they might get involved. Yeah [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2417.02s)]
*  I mean the few points I make just to add to that very good summary. I mean first of all [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2420.22s)]
*  They are a much kind of bigger [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2424.06s)]
*  And I don't know echo trump with this. They're so smart. You think they're jesus. No, they're sophisticated. Let's say they they're a bigger organization [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2426.62s)]
*  Politically, they are deeply integrated into the government of lebanon, which is a dysfunctional government [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2434.84s)]
*  But to give people a flavor of that [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2440.62s)]
*  I remember when we were in government and we would do bilateral meetings with the lebanese prime minister [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2442.46s)]
*  We'd have to have like a very short meeting [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2448.2200000000003s)]
*  You know you have the meeting where there's like, you know eight people at a table on each side and you know [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2450.54s)]
*  the two heads of state or heads of government are sitting in chairs and [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2455.1s)]
*  You'd meet for a very brief time and then you skinny that meeting down [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2458.8599999999997s)]
*  To like the president prime minister with like one or two people because there's some fucking hesbola guys [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2462.46s)]
*  Like literally like rolling with the prime minister, you know, like they are they're part of the government of lebanon [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2467.2599999999998s)]
*  So they have this kind of political standing in lebanon at the same time [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2472.3799999999997s)]
*  They're much bigger than hamas on their military side. They have a much bigger and more sophisticated rocket stockpile [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2476.7s)]
*  And then in terms of military tactics like what I would underscore is they fought in syria for like a decade [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2484.54s)]
*  So these people and by the way, the israelis are often bombing [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2491.66s)]
*  Hezbollah targets in syria [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2495.58s)]
*  Yes [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2496.94s)]
*  Because if they saw yeah if they saw hezbollah getting transfers of weapons in from the iranians or whomever [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2497.34s)]
*  They would hit them. But the point is that these these people have serious experience more than hamas [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2503.18s)]
*  in recent wars including in syria, so [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2509.18s)]
*  This is like an army getting involved. I mean they are terrorists too and they commit terrorist attacks [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2512.54s)]
*  They've blown up buses with israeli tourists in in parts of the world [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2517.42s)]
*  but you know, that's why people warn of this escalation because [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2521.66s)]
*  They're actually a bigger and and more well equipped and experienced [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2525.9s)]
*  version of hamas [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2530.86s)]
*  Closer to iran too because they're shia and more ideologically aligned with iran [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2532.86s)]
*  So they're seen as much more like almost an extension of iranian interests [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2537.02s)]
*  They have obviously their own independent [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2541.1s)]
*  issues and standing in lebanon, but but hamas is sunni muslim [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2543.74s)]
*  versus hezbollah being a shia organization, so [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2547.98s)]
*  Them getting involved would be a game changer in a bad way [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2550.7s)]
*  and the question is [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2553.98s)]
*  If they see, you know the humanitarian if things get really ugly in gaza [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2555.5s)]
*  Or do they feel themselves somehow compelled to get involved and then that's you know [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2560.7799999999997s)]
*  Then then we're back to you know, a two-front war [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2565.2599999999998s)]
*  And and maybe a war that further devastates lebanon and beirut which is already a mess so [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2568.46s)]
*  You know, it's not good like like the that's what you don't want to happen. Yeah, lebanon's basically a failed state at the moment [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2573.02s)]
*  I think I saw a state department report from 2019. It said they estimated hezbollah as like [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2578.14s)]
*  tens of thousands of members globally and also, you know the other the stat you always see is 150,000 rockets as [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2583.34s)]
*  Hezbollah pointed at israel. So yeah, it'd be a big big deal [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2589.58s)]
*  uh last question ben, so [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2592.86s)]
*  Do you think so the u.s [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2595.58s)]
*  In cutter decided to block iran's access to the six billion in oil revenue that we've been talking about that was transferred from south [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2596.86s)]
*  Korea to qatar as part of that hostage swap [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2603.98s)]
*  Is this this discord user asks is that denial of funds a causeless belly for iran to go nuts? [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2607.34s)]
*  um, I don't know, I mean domestic politically this seems like the only path forward right like yeah, they're not saying [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2613.82s)]
*  Iran will never get this money. They're saying it's [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2619.9s)]
*  Indefinitely paused [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2622.84s)]
*  um, I don't know again [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2624.94s)]
*  We don't we don't make deals with the iranians because we like them we do it because it's in our interest and in this case [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2626.3s)]
*  It was to get hostages home. I do wonder what you think though [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2631.34s)]
*  It's like the u.s cuts a deal with iran to put in place the jcpoa [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2634.46s)]
*  We pull out of it. We do this hostage swap. Yeah, we refuse them the funds [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2639.34s)]
*  At some point you're going to foreclose diplomacy with the iranians [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2643.34s)]
*  I'm not saying that's my like foremost concern at the moment but long term it is something that it's just worth thinking about [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2645.9s)]
*  Yeah, look I [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2652.62s)]
*  The iranians like do plenty of bad shit [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2654.38s)]
*  um [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2657.34s)]
*  I'm going to raise an issue that you know [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2658.3s)]
*  This six billion dollar thing keeps getting raised because it's like the only republican attack on biden that they can make [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2660.3s)]
*  And we've talked about why it's a bullshit attack. I don't believe [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2665.42s)]
*  And iran has more iran has hundreds of billions of dollars. It's a nation state with a lot of oil [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2668.78s)]
*  So it's not like they're sitting there with no money [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2674.06s)]
*  And then they're just waiting for a check to come through from like a hostage, you know from this kind of deal [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2676.38s)]
*  so this is kind of a [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2681.5800000000004s)]
*  We've already talked about the amounts that hamas and hesblu [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2683.26s)]
*  Like are a fraction of the iranian overall budget, you know, like they they can find that money without this this deal [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2686.6200000000003s)]
*  so I understand why politically we're not doing it the one thing i'm going to say because nobody makes arguments on the other side of [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2693.5s)]
*  these things is [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2697.5800000000004s)]
*  you know what maybe pulling out of the iran nuclear agreement and [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2699.5s)]
*  And and reescalating tensions in that region was not a good idea empowering the most hard-line [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2705.6600000000003s)]
*  factions in the country [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2709.8999999999996s)]
*  Like you humiliating the government that did the iran nuclear deal pushing iranian politics in a hard-line direction [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2711.5s)]
*  um [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2718.3799999999997s)]
*  I could list a whole bunch of other things. We've already talked about the abram accords obviously like [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2719.4199999999996s)]
*  um, i'm not doing a cause causal analysis i'm just saying that like [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2723.4199999999996s)]
*  If you if you turn these things into constant zero-sum [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2728.7799999999997s)]
*  like hard-line [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2733.02s)]
*  Approaches that's kind of what that's the middle east you're going to get you know [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2735.08s)]
*  Some place there has to be some space for diplomacy. There just does otherwise these [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2740.22s)]
*  The wars are going to go on forever. Now I get in the near term [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2744.4599999999996s)]
*  Just cut off all funding for iran squeeze squeeze squeeze that makes total sense to me [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2747.8199999999997s)]
*  But it's not going to like solve this problem [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2752.3799999999997s)]
*  It's not going to like prevent iran from having any resourcing to provide to mas and it is it is [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2754.06s)]
*  It is wrong to tell people that it's wrong to make people think [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2759.02s)]
*  That if we turn off the six billion dollars that somehow hamas will never get any money from iran again [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2761.9799999999996s)]
*  That's just not true. No, no, they're they're yeah, they're not overly concerned about uh, [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2766.54s)]
*  The humanitarian supplies that they were able to purchase with that six billion if it were not turned off [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2771.2599999999998s)]
*  Um, we're almost at an hour anything else you want to talk about before we before we wrap it [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2775.74s)]
*  The only thing i'm gonna say on the iran point is that we just should note because it came after the last international response roundup [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2780.14s)]
*  We did mbs muhammad salman did a phone call with the president of iran [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2785.82s)]
*  Which he'd never done very weird not done for and then read out of the call was [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2790.86s)]
*  Expressing concern about like israeli war crimes and and so it is just a signal mbs is a weathervane [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2795.5s)]
*  You know for where the gulf arabs are going like, you know that I think is a sign of these leaders being worried [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2800.86s)]
*  Um almost preemptively about public opinion, you know, so [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2808.2200000000003s)]
*  It shows how much those normalization deals are kind of on on ice right now. Yeah, I would not uh, I would not [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2811.98s)]
*  Suspect that mbs is going to jump into those talks at least publicly anytime soon [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2818.86s)]
*  The normalization talks I did see one tweet just to mention, uh [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2822.7000000000003s)]
*  Someone tweeted jackie hindrich that the u.s [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C5XsIXkLzE&t=2826.86s)]
