# Henry Kissinger’s Crimes Against Humanity Should Not Be Celebrated
**Pod Save the World:** [June 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM)
*  Welcome back to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Ben Rhodes. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1.84s)]
*  Ben, what did you get Hank Kissinger for his 100th birthday? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2.64s)]
*  I have his friend, so I call him Hank by Henry. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=7.76s)]
*  I mean, you know, what I'm depressed about is I was not able to deliver my gift because I wasn't [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=9.68s)]
*  invited to the party at the gala party at the New York Public Library. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=16.64s)]
*  Well, we should have. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=20.32s)]
*  In my hometown, too. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=21.28s)]
*  We should talk about why you weren't invited later. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=24.48s)]
*  But a lot of people were. Big show today, Ben. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=25.2s)]
*  We got a blockbuster new report about who bombed the Nord Stream pipeline. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=27.759999999999998s)]
*  The latest blockbuster report. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=31.68s)]
*  There's a slowly unfolding environmental disaster happening in Ukraine. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=34.64s)]
*  Some progress towards accountability for the 2021 assassination of Haiti's president. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=38.96s)]
*  The CIA director Bill Burns went to China. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=44.0s)]
*  The Saudis are just dominating the sports washing game. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  We basically just have to tip our hats to them at this point. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=50.08s)]
*  Henry Kissinger mentioned him earlier in accountability. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=52.4s)]
*  Trump's classified document woes media blackouts in Pakistan [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=55.36s)]
*  and some headlines out of Iran, Afghanistan and the UK and then monster show. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=58.64s)]
*  A lot going on in the world today. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=62.64s)]
*  This is one of those weeks where we could have done to you did the interview today. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=64.24s)]
*  Friend of mine, friend of ours, a new crooked contributor, Tim Mack, who's on the ground in [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=68.48s)]
*  Kiev. We talk about the counter offensive and Tim's substack is usually titled counter offensive. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=74.32s)]
*  Great substack, by the way. I'm a subscriber. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=84.08s)]
*  Very good. We talk about what's happening now as there are indications that the counter offensive [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=85.68s)]
*  is beginning, what the morale issues are on the ground in Ukraine. Tim talks to a lot of Ukrainian [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=90.64s)]
*  soldiers as well as people around him in Kiev, what the views of Zelensky are inside of Ukraine, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=96.48s)]
*  how does that compare and contrast to the, let's just say, hey, geography of Zelensky around the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=101.76s)]
*  world. What Ukrainians think of these cross border attacks into Russia that we've seen more and more [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=107.6s)]
*  of. So it's fascinating kind of glimpse under the hood of like what it's like actually there. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=113.91999999999999s)]
*  And Tim's just a good guy. Good to hear from him. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=119.83999999999999s)]
*  Did you see the semaphore story about kind of the Ukrainian press office, like stripping [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  accommodations away from reporters, credentials, I should say, who sort of seem to not tow the party [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=126.08s)]
*  line? I did. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=132.4s)]
*  Interesting piece. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know, there's [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  been some interesting pieces recently about some aspects of Ukraine that, you know, we'll talk [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=137.04000000000002s)]
*  about the Nord Stream thing. There was, there's that long piece in the Times about kind of far [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=141.36s)]
*  right insignia on some uniforms. I don't know if you saw that. So it's important to remember [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=146.08s)]
*  there's like nuance in every society, of course, you know. Exactly. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=150.16000000000003s)]
*  So, but a lot of interesting reporting. Yeah. But Tim Mack, great guy. I've known him [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=152.88000000000002s)]
*  from afar. He was a political reporter, investigative reporter. He worked for the Daily Beast [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=157.84s)]
*  and then went to NPR. And I think NPR basically said that as the invasion was ramping up or it [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=162.55999999999997s)]
*  looked like Russia was going to invade, hey, could you go over to Ukraine? And he stayed [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=168.0s)]
*  for a year and then more recently left NPR to go it alone and write for his sub-tech, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=171.44s)]
*  the counter offensive. Right. And served in the military too. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  Served in the military. So he has that perspective as well. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=179.67999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Okay, Ben. So there was this blockbuster report in the Washington Post on Tuesday. I love [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=181.04s)]
*  when they run those big ones on Tuesday. I really do appreciate it. About the sabotage of the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  Nord Stream natural gas pipeline. So according to a summary of intelligence that was leaked [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=191.6s)]
*  as part of the classified Pentagon document leaked to the social media site Discord, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=197.04s)]
*  apparently a European intelligence service collected information about a Ukrainian military [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=201.76s)]
*  plan to covertly attack the Nord Stream one pipeline, which carries natural gas from Russia [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=206.48s)]
*  to Germany. That intelligence was passed along to the CIA in June of 2022. So three months before [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=211.92s)]
*  the September 26 attack that ultimately targeted both Nord Stream pipelines. This intelligence [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=218.32s)]
*  apparently came from a human source in Ukraine. The post says the intelligence has been backed [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=224.56s)]
*  up since by evidence uncovered by German investigators. This covert sabotage team [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=228.95999999999998s)]
*  reported directly to Ukraine's highest military officer who was put in charge maybe to keep [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  Zelensky out of the planning, give him some plausible deniability. We don't know. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=241.2s)]
*  German investigators believe that Ukrainian special operations troops rented a boat in [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=244.88s)]
*  Germany using false identifications and a Polish front company and then took this sailboat over [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=248.56s)]
*  the pipelines, used some sort of underwater vehicle to go 240 feet down, place explosive [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=255.44s)]
*  on the pipelines and then blow them up. So professional operation. The Germans found traces [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=260.56s)]
*  of explosive residue in this rental boat. Shortly after the Nord Stream attack happened, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=265.44s)]
*  President Biden called it a deliberate act of sabotage and accused Russians of pumping out [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=270.4s)]
*  disinformation and lies, but he didn't directly accuse Russia of blowing the pipeline up. But I [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=274.56s)]
*  think most listeners took it that way. I did too. Since then, I think most Western, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=280.23999999999995s)]
*  at least European countries seem to have pumped the brakes a little bit on pointing the finger [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=286.79999999999995s)]
*  at Russia. There's been some reporting that blamed the US. I think that's been largely discredited. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=290.4s)]
*  Ben, just a couple of thoughts. First, I continue just to be blown away by how much unbelievably [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=295.04s)]
*  sensitive intelligence was sitting on this server for the Air National Guard IT guy to get his hands [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=301.28s)]
*  on. You would think that information fingering Ukrainians for blowing up the Nord Stream pipeline [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=307.28s)]
*  that we got from some liaison service in Europe would be really closely held, no? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=314.64s)]
*  You would think, Tommy. You would think. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=319.84s)]
*  But the IT guy at the Air National Guard base in Massachusetts had it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=323.04s)]
*  Which means that thousands of people had it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=326.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. That's right. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=327.6s)]
*  That's what's crazy about it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=328.56s)]
*  Yeah, that is wild. Second, if the Ukrainians really did do this, and I think, look, we should [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=329.52s)]
*  caveat it because it's one source in an intel report. They're not always right, but it does [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=335.36s)]
*  seem like there's a body of evidence pointing the finger at Ukraine. I do think it's by far and away [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  the dumbest and most irresponsible thing that the Ukrainian government has done [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=344.24s)]
*  throughout the entire war. Remember, the Nord Stream pipelines, 51% are owned by Gazprom, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=348.72s)]
*  the Russian state-owned gas company, but the rest is owned by a bunch of European companies. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=354.08000000000004s)]
*  I don't know how you blow up infrastructure owned by the French and the Germans [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=360.48s)]
*  and then demand that they give you cash and weapons. I don't know how you hang Biden and [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=364.48s)]
*  other leaders out to dry like this and have them pointing the finger at Russia when you know it's [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=368.8s)]
*  not true. So just a huge, huge mistake in my opinion by the Ukrainian government here. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=373.92s)]
*  Well, I guess there's a lot of things that are interesting about this, again, assuming this is [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=380.64000000000004s)]
*  true. First, pretty capable operation. As you said, that didn't sound like a simple operation. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=384.96000000000004s)]
*  The lengths that they went to to conceal it, false identities, there was an espionage piece of it, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=394.64s)]
*  and then there's the operational piece of going down. So one thing that we've learned is that the [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=400.32s)]
*  Ukrainians are pretty entrepreneurial given the amount of their resources they're able to do a [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=405.28s)]
*  lot. That's interesting. Yeah. And just if I was totally wrong about this, I remember the first [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=410.48s)]
*  time we talked about it, I was like, I don't think the Ukrainians have a professional military diving [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=413.36s)]
*  capability. I think I probably said that too. Yeah. I think I probably said the same thing. So they [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=417.76s)]
*  clearly have a capability. I think to your point, I also would have thought that. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=422.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. The thing that is interesting, I talked to Tim Mack about these attacks into Russia, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=427.44s)]
*  and one of his points is that if we are to believe the reporting that the US is uncomfortable with [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=433.92s)]
*  this, it's pretty striking that the Ukrainians are willing to consistently buck the United States [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=440.15999999999997s)]
*  and its allies in doing these things. Tim's point was that it's because there's such a value to the [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=447.84s)]
*  Ukrainian people to show that they're taking the war to Russia. But now we've seen that there was [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=454.4s)]
*  US provided military equipment in one of these assaults on a Russian border province. Obviously, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=459.84s)]
*  there are these drone attacks around the Kremlin and then potentially this. And it may be that the [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=467.52s)]
*  Ukrainians are just demonstrating that they realize they can do things that we don't want them to do. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=474.08s)]
*  So in other words, your argument would hold if it was the case that the Ukrainians doing that was [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=482.88s)]
*  going to put at risk their support from the West, but they may be learning, maybe wrongly, maybe [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=489.92s)]
*  rightly. I don't really know that, well, maybe we can get away with this stuff. This is a big question [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=495.52s)]
*  about whether the United States is okay with this or not. I don't know. Because if the US is not okay [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=506.72s)]
*  with it, then that is really worrying. Then you're totally right because it's like, existentially, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=514.0s)]
*  the Ukrainians need to sustain the support of the United States and European countries to stay in [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=519.44s)]
*  this fight. It's kind of how they equip themselves and arm themselves. And so it's a giant risk, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=524.24s)]
*  if nothing else, for them to kind of do stuff like this and presume that they can keep doing it and [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=529.6s)]
*  keep pushing the envelope and not invite either escalation from Putin or some kind of blowback [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=535.36s)]
*  from the US and Europe. That leads to the Biden point. I mean, it does raise the question of [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=541.28s)]
*  what he was basing that statement on, that the Russians are putting out disinformation. And [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=547.84s)]
*  was that part of an effort to kind of be in the gray space of a war in which you sometimes [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=553.52s)]
*  shade the truth, I guess? Or did he just not know what had happened? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=561.2800000000001s)]
*  This raises a lot of questions. It really does. There's a lot of questions. You sort of alluded [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=567.2800000000001s)]
*  to this at the top. The cross-border operations of the Bulgarad town or region of Russia that we [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=571.2800000000001s)]
*  talked about last week, I think, we now know used American MRAPs, American armored vehicles. I think [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=579.5200000000001s)]
*  some of the soldiers on those vehicles had neo-Nazi flags on their arms. So concerning in [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=585.84s)]
*  a number of ways. Two, I talked to some folks in the administration who said, in general, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=592.32s)]
*  over and over again, publicly and privately, the US sends the message, hey, don't attack this [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=598.0s)]
*  infrastructure. Hey, attacks inside Russia are not okay. And the response is, okay, cool, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=602.96s)]
*  when are we getting the F-16s? So it's a bit of an understandable response, but I'm sure frustrating. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=608.08s)]
*  And then they also sort of, I think people in the government think there are questions about [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=615.2s)]
*  whether this operation on Nord Stream was really led by a general to give Zelensky plausible [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=620.5600000000001s)]
*  deniability or whether it signals something more like real command and control problems [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=627.9200000000001s)]
*  within the Ukrainian military that frankly are a far bigger problem. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=635.2s)]
*  So this is exactly right. I mean, these are the questions that I kind of circle around on this, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=638.48s)]
*  which is, and either one is kind of a leads to some pretty difficult conversations, right? Because [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=642.88s)]
*  there is a scenario in which this is a war. It's a massive war in Europe. It's a chaotic existential [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=649.12s)]
*  war for Ukrainians. And therefore it could be that there are units to do their own thing going into [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=654.64s)]
*  Russia, including, you know, a lot of Russians were in that unit that did that attack into Belgorod, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=661.76s)]
*  or whether there's some kind of super secret compartmented covert operations group within [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=668.64s)]
*  Ukraine that could attack the Nord Stream pipeline without Zelensky knowing about it. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=673.2800000000001s)]
*  If that's the case, to your point, like, then how many more of these could we see that are kind of [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=678.32s)]
*  over time, perhaps there's more and more independent operators, or Zelensky himself is, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=683.76s)]
*  you know, okay with this authorizing it, at least looking the other way, if not, like, you know, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=689.9200000000001s)]
*  running it operationally. And then that calls into question, like, hmm, like, how far out of step [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=694.4s)]
*  is Zelensky from the US? This is going to be a space to watch, because the trend line has been [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=699.52s)]
*  towards more and more risk taking by Ukrainians in these types of operations. And I do think at [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=706.4s)]
*  some point, I imagine inside the Biden administration, there's a real question about, like, are we okay [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=712.88s)]
*  with this? Are we not okay with this, but we're willing to live with this? Or are we not okay with [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=717.76s)]
*  this? And we'd like to see this reigned in. Yeah. And we don't write right now, we don't really know [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=723.28s)]
*  the answer to that question. And, you know, I think we'll have to see kind of probably read tea leaves [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=727.6s)]
*  to figure that out. And listen, I think it reaffirms Biden's caution to date. Right? I mean, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=732.56s)]
*  I think the narrative in Washington now is like, look, we're eventually going to cave on all these [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=738.56s)]
*  things, the f 16s, the tanks, the long range missiles, the attacks into Russia, yes, let's [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=742.16s)]
*  just give them everything now. And you and I just talked through all the reasons why I don't know, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=746.64s)]
*  it might be a bad idea to give increasingly lethal long range weapons to the Ukrainians, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=751.6s)]
*  or at least it all gives voice to why there has been so much caution, because they've obviously [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=756.24s)]
*  known a lot more than we have for a long time. Yeah. And I guess the Hawks case would be, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=760.8000000000001s)]
*  this is a war, they should do whatever the hell they have to do. So destroying European [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=766.16s)]
*  infrastructure, even if it's European, is worth it to cut off Russian gas, like the attacks in [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=770.88s)]
*  Russia are worth it to boost around Ukraine. We worked with Stalin to defeat the Nazis, right? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=775.6800000000001s)]
*  Those are the sort of historical things you'll hear people say. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=779.92s)]
*  Now, that is true until it's not. We don't know, we're only a year and a few months into this war, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=781.4399999999999s)]
*  we still don't know what might trigger some kind of Russian escalation, whether it's some nuclear [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=791.68s)]
*  incident or something else. We still don't know how the fracturing of a command structure in Ukraine [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=796.48s)]
*  might affect European support. I mean, there's a lot of risk that comes with it as well. I tend [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=804.0s)]
*  to err on the side of, as you're suggesting you do, like, hey, we've got to be pretty careful [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=809.36s)]
*  about this, because you can lose control of this pretty quickly. But we'll see. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=815.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, at the very least, the kind of commentary that's like, more, more, more now, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=821.12s)]
*  with no notes of caution or no sort of, I don't know, humility about the Iraq War or any other [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=826.48s)]
*  sort of event to the last 30 years is troubling to me. Speaking of escalations, Ben, I mean, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=830.64s)]
*  you're going to talk a lot more about Ukraine with Tim Mack, especially about the counteroffensive, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=834.96s)]
*  but the other big news today is that a major dam and hydropower plant around the Dnieper River [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=838.96s)]
*  has been blown up, probably by sabotage, putting at risk hundreds of thousands of people [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=845.6s)]
*  downstream from it who are at risk of getting flooded out or drowning and creating this long-term [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=850.96s)]
*  environmental disaster. Reports say this dam was holding back a body of water the size of Great [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=854.96s)]
*  Salt Lake in Utah, so massive, and that water is used to cool nuclear infrastructure at the [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=860.1600000000001s)]
*  Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants. So far, the IAEA says there is no immediate nuclear safety risk, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=865.2s)]
*  but boy, hearing about lack of cooling water for a nuclear plant gave me Fukushima PTSD. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=871.76s)]
*  There are also concerns I read about landmines getting washed downstream or detonated. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=879.0400000000001s)]
*  Water supplies will be at risk in big parts of Ukraine and in Russian-occupied Crimea. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=884.0s)]
*  So the Ukrainian president, Vladimir Zelensky, blamed Russian terrorists, he said, for blowing [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=888.88s)]
*  up the dam. He's been warning about attacks on this dam for a year. I saw last week, actually Tim [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=894.4s)]
*  Mack linked to it in his newsletter, there was concern that there was going to be some sort of [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=899.76s)]
*  sabotage operation on the nuclear plant, maybe this could be part of it. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=906.0799999999999s)]
*  At the same time, the Russians, Dmitry Peskov, the Russian spokesman, blamed Ukraine, they said, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=910.3199999999999s)]
*  this was Ukrainian sabotage. It seems to have happened just after the counteroffensive may [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=915.04s)]
*  have started. So the big picture point is disaster after disaster for the people of Ukraine. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=920.48s)]
*  But per our previous conversation about Nord Stream, it does get harder to know who to believe. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=926.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting because first and foremost, it creates real humanitarian, even kind of [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=934.08s)]
*  ecological disasters that are going to be felt most acutely by the people of Ukraine. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=939.84s)]
*  It also, though, kind of complicates things for both sides of the conflict. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=946.24s)]
*  It threatens, I think, the water supply into Crimea. It threatens this nuclear plant. It threatens [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=950.88s)]
*  population centers that are Russian-controlled and they're Ukrainian-controlled. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=956.4s)]
*  And to your point, given... It's interesting, the Ukrainians have been very... [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=959.92s)]
*  In addition to what we just talked about with these operations, they've also been [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=967.68s)]
*  opaque sometimes about what's information, what's disinformation. And yeah, we are at a point where [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=971.52s)]
*  you obviously trust, entirely trust the Ukrainians and Zelensky more, but you do scratch your head. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=978.48s)]
*  It's hard to know what's happening in the fog of war right now. And what may seem apparent one day, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=986.4s)]
*  you learn later, was very different. And I couldn't tell you right now who blew up this dam and why. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=993.6800000000001s)]
*  That's kind of going to be part of the context of things too. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1000.72s)]
*  Yeah, hopefully we'll learn soon. But really, really awful for all the people downstream of that thing. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1004.5600000000001s)]
*  Pate, the world is brought to you by The Economists, John. If you're listening to this [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1009.44s)]

*  the assassination of former Haitian president Jovenel Moise after a federal judge in Florida [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1264.8s)]
*  sentenced a businessman and former drug trafficker named Rodolphe Jarre to life in prison for his [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1269.84s)]
*  role in the assassination. Jarre reportedly conspired with Haitian officials. He hired [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1275.68s)]
*  Colombian mercenaries and use armed ship from the U.S. to pull off this assassination. There are [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1280.24s)]
*  still big questions about the role that current Haitian political leaders, including the then [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1285.52s)]
*  prime minister, now acting president, Ariel Henry, may have played in the assassination plot. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1290.64s)]
*  Bizarrely, this guy, Jarre, admitted his guilt during interview with the New York Times while [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1296.4s)]
*  he was on the run like a year ago. He later voluntarily agreed to be extradited to the U.S. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1301.92s)]
*  There's a bunch of co-conspirators who I think have not been prosecuted yet. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1307.2s)]
*  Since the assassination, gang violence in Haiti has exploded. The U.N. secretary general said [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1312.64s)]
*  violence in Port-au-Prince is comparable to a war zone, calls to send in an international [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1317.8400000000001s)]
*  peacekeeping force have not materialized. Instead, there's just been an uptick in vigilante reprisal [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1322.4s)]
*  attacks against gangs by average citizens and no political resolution in sight. I'm glad that [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1328.0s)]
*  someone got prosecuted and may do life in prison now, but it's not helping the people of Haiti. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1334.72s)]
*  Well, yeah. First of all, the prosecution is pretty amazing that the U.S. just prosecuted [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1338.96s)]
*  someone for the assassination of a foreign leader. It's not a bigger deal. It's something kind of [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1344.4s)]
*  sad about the fact that Haiti's seen as a place that's just violent and stuff like this happens. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1349.92s)]
*  I think it's really important, having done this, to continue to pursue the other pieces of this [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1355.6000000000001s)]
*  conspiracy, which clearly ran through Haiti itself and its political actors. That's important to know [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1359.8400000000001s)]
*  because you don't want to be rewarding people that were involved in the assassination. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1366.24s)]
*  There were mercenaries from South America who were carrying this out. There may have been other [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1369.6000000000001s)]
*  people in the U.S. who were part of this. I think it's very important to not stop with this [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1375.1200000000001s)]
*  prosecution and just try to unravel all the threads here and hopefully pull as many of these [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1379.12s)]
*  conspirators in as we can. At the same time, yeah, there needs to be clearly some intervention, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1384.96s)]
*  I don't mean a military intervention, but some more robust intervention diplomatically and with [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1392.96s)]
*  assistance and maybe with some kind of peacekeeping component. The Canadians were being recruited by [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1398.08s)]
*  the U.S. to send peacekeepers or a force to Haiti. They didn't want to do that, but the need is still [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1404.72s)]
*  clearly very much there for some kind of effort to restore some amount of stability. What you [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1410.72s)]
*  mentioned about civilians rising up against gangs is pretty remarkable. The people are putting their [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1415.6000000000001s)]
*  lives on the line through this kind of vigilante counter-attacks on gangs. It just shows you the [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1420.8s)]
*  degree of frustration and desperation among the Haitian people. This is something where I hope [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1425.28s)]
*  that we just don't get numbed to this kind of constant state of violence in Haiti, but [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1430.88s)]
*  continue to try different ways, not just to have justice for this assassination, but to [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1434.96s)]
*  have a better Haiti policy. Yeah, better Haiti policy, some sort of. I mean, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1441.0400000000002s)]
*  I don't know if they've had a functioning government in any way for years now. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1445.92s)]
*  No. Another big story this week, Ben, was the Financial Times reported that CIA Director Bill [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1449.68s)]
*  Burns secretly traveled to China in May to meet with his sort of Intel world counterparts [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1455.92s)]
*  with the goal of maintaining an open line of communications in those intelligence channels. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1461.44s)]
*  We also know that Biden's National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, went to Vienna in May [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1465.8400000000001s)]
*  to meet with his Chinese counterpart. President Biden in public has repeatedly stressed the need [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1470.0800000000002s)]
*  to have some sort of crisis hotline type channel set up to prevent conflict. So sending Bill Burns [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1474.96s)]
*  makes a lot of sense. He's widely respected. He's got deep relationships all over the world. I'm [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1481.04s)]
*  sure the Chinese feel like he's a known quantity of them and a discreet one at that. Ben, I would [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1485.12s)]
*  bet that I'm curious what you think that both Jake and Bill were probably sent with like a letter or [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1489.84s)]
*  a direct message of some sort from President Biden to pass along to Xi Jinping. It's interesting to [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1496.4799999999998s)]
*  me that the Chinese were willing to grant Bill and Jake these meetings while refusing to schedule [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1503.28s)]
*  meetings with the Secretary of Defense or with Tony Blinken or with Joe Biden himself with Xi. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1509.6s)]
*  Do you think Bill got the royal treatment like French President Emmanuel Macron? A little [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1515.9199999999998s)]
*  different? How do you think this went? I don't know that he had the same tea ceremony, but look, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1519.36s)]
*  we've seen in the last few days kind of what you are worried about when you have a kind of spiraling [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1522.7199999999998s)]
*  U.S.-China relationship. In the Taiwan Strait, a U.S. warship was kind of cut off by a Chinese [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1529.6s)]
*  vessel such that the U.S. warship had to kind of put the brakes on so that they didn't collide. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1535.36s)]
*  It's got to be hard to do with the brakes on a destroyer. Not to say, and what you worry about [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1540.1599999999999s)]
*  there is as the Chinese carry out more and more military activity in the Taiwan Strait, the body [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1544.48s)]
*  of water between Taiwan and mainland China, that maybe next time it doesn't get the brakes in time, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1548.24s)]
*  there's a collision. How do you manage that? Didn't they recently do this with a fighter jet [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1553.92s)]
*  and a tanker? There's an amazing video where the U.S. had kind of a reconnaissance or surveillance [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1557.3600000000001s)]
*  plane in the sky, same territory, which we see as international, in which the Chinese kind of claim [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1562.48s)]
*  as their own. They basically buzzed it. You can see in the plane, it's like rattling and the [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1568.08s)]
*  pilot's there. I mean, it's just pretty close calls. Yeah, and that's a big deal because if [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1572.96s)]
*  you fly through someone's jet wash, as we all know from Top Gun, it can lead to bad outcomes. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1577.1200000000001s)]
*  I got my fucking degree in aviation at Miramar like you did. I got my heart broken by Goose. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1581.68s)]
*  Yeah, we saw what happened to Goose, right? Make these points because the reason this is connected [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1588.8s)]
*  is right now there was a sense that there was no floor under the U.S.-China relationship, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1593.3600000000001s)]
*  that things were collapsing, that from the cancellation of Tony Blinken's visit and [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1596.8s)]
*  after the balloon fiasco and everything, we weren't even talking. Lloyd Austin's not getting [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1601.12s)]
*  meetings. It does feel like both sides are at least through this kind of quiet diplomacy. Bill [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1605.28s)]
*  Burns, the U.S. ambassador is having meetings. You got other U.S. diplomats going over there, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1610.7199999999998s)]
*  Dan Krittenbrink, our Assistant Secretary of State for Asia. There's an effort to kind of [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1616.8s)]
*  reestablish communication. At a minimum, you would hope that that could allow for, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1620.7199999999998s)]
*  yeah, like hotlines, military-to-military discussion to try to avoid escalation around [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1625.36s)]
*  incidents like what I talked about. But at the same time that the U.S. is trying to do that, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1629.76s)]
*  we're rolling out a big old welcome carpet for Narendra Modi that is like a centerpiece of our [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1634.48s)]
*  anti-China strategy in the region, right? Yeah, he's addressing a joint session of Congress. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1640.08s)]
*  He's addressing a joint session of Congress. Lloyd Austin was just ninnia talking about defense [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1644.24s)]
*  cooperation. This is the complicated and delicate dance that is being done by the Biden administration, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1647.92s)]
*  building this kind of counter-China coalition and policy and strategy while at the same time saying, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1654.08s)]
*  we need to talk to each other. I think it's right to be trying to talk to the Chinese, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1660.16s)]
*  but they probably do need something more kind of formalized in terms of engagement and meetings [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1664.4s)]
*  and Biden talking to Xi than just doing it through the CIA director. That might be the right place [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1670.16s)]
*  to start. And like you said, I'm sure there's probably letters being carried back and forth. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1675.44s)]
*  But I'd like to see a place, and I don't think it's a reward to China to say we should be [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1678.72s)]
*  exchanging visits with Tony Blinken and his counterpart. This should be kind of more above [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1684.64s)]
*  water, as it were, because right now it feels a little tenuous. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1689.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it does feel a little tenuous. You mentioning the India, the Modi visit, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1693.68s)]
*  did make me realize I hadn't prepped anything on this horrible train crash in India that [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1697.68s)]
*  reportedly two trains collided, maybe with a third train. 275 people were killed, more than 1100 were [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1702.48s)]
*  injured. There's not a big public policy piece of this for us to discuss in terms of the US. I mean, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1708.88s)]
*  it's more like train infrastructure and investment, I think, but awful and just worth mentioning. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1714.0s)]
*  The only human piece is obviously the most acute, but the only public policy piece is [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1718.08s)]
*  part of the US strategy as we're kind of separating out from China, right? [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1722.72s)]
*  I think is going to be encouraging all that investment that was flowing into China for so [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1726.24s)]
*  many years. Like, hey, invest in India instead. They're going to be our friend. And this is the [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1730.08s)]
*  kind of reason that that investment doesn't happen. So obviously the human piece is most important, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1734.48s)]
*  but the kind of lack of infrastructure and corruption and it's opaque. This is a reminder [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1740.96s)]
*  that it's not going to be easy for India to just kind of become the new China in terms of attracting [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1748.48s)]
*  that kind of business. Yeah, it's a really good point. You know who is willing to spend [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1752.8s)]
*  huge money on pretty much anything though, Ben, is the Saudi government. We had some big news on the [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1756.88s)]
*  Saudi sports washing front. On Tuesday, the PGA tour and the Saudi-owned Live Golf Tour announced [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1761.68s)]
*  that they have agreed to a merger for you non-golf fans. The PGA tours are the original [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1768.32s)]
*  organizer of pro golf events. The Live Tour launched last year as this Saudi backed alternative [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1773.2s)]
*  to the PGA. They were paying players just to show up. It led to these really kind of fun fights [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1779.84s)]
*  between players who were still part of the PGA and players that joined the Live Tour. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1786.08s)]
*  There was a legal battle that was going on in addition to the War of Words. And here's a sort [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1791.6s)]
*  of a representative quote from Jay Monahan, the head of the PGA Tour from last June. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1797.04s)]
*  I think you'd have to be living under a rock to not know that there are significant implications. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1803.28s)]
*  And as it relates to the families of 9-11, I have two families that are close to me that lost loved [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1809.36s)]
*  ones. And so my heart goes out to them. And I would ask, you know, any player that has left [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1815.92s)]
*  or any player that would ever consider leaving, have you ever had to apologize [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1824.08s)]
*  for being a member of the PGA Tour? A question now everybody will get to ask. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1829.6s)]
*  Donald Trump celebrated the news, Ben. He truthed great news from Live Golf, a big, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1835.36s)]
*  beautiful and glamorous deal for the wonderful world of golf. For some reason, he put it in all [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1839.6s)]
*  caps. Credit to the Donald. He actually predicted this via a different truth like last year. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1844.32s)]
*  The Saudis are also making big moves in soccer, Ben. Real Madrid star Karim Benzema reportedly [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1849.84s)]
*  signed a three-year $643 million deal to play with the Saudi club. This comes after Cristiano Ronaldo [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1855.68s)]
*  signed a deal with the Saudi club that is reportedly worth $200 million. So here we are, man. I guess [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1863.2s)]
*  I'm not in any way surprised that at the end of the day, big money is trumping, you know, human [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1869.92s)]
*  rights considerations in sports, in business, even for the U.S. government. But wow, has it [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1875.68s)]
*  been depressing to watch. And it happened fast. What's this asshole's name? Jay? [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1881.04s)]
*  Jay Monahan. Jay Monahan. OK, like let's start with Jay Monahan, OK? Because first of all, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1886.88s)]
*  are those concerns no longer true anymore? So basically a few months ago when you felt [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1892.72s)]
*  your business was threatened, you played the 9-11 card, you talk about the 9-11 families. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1897.04s)]
*  Is that not true now today, Jay Monahan? No, and you're right. But also him playing the 9-11 [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1901.6s)]
*  card then I think was a little disingenuous. He was using 9-11 to win what was a financial fight. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1907.6799999999998s)]
*  Exactly. No, but that's what's so cynical about it. So the first point is it just proves that [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1914.48s)]
*  that guy was willing to play any card. Right? Second point is I feel bad for all these PGA [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1918.08s)]
*  people who took a stand. And we've talked about people that turned down a lot of money, right? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1925.28s)]
*  I think Tiger Woods turned in like a billion dollars or something. All these people who sold [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1928.8s)]
*  out, who sold their soul, Phil Mickelson, Greg Norman, people just jumping into the bed with [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1933.76s)]
*  Mohammed bin Salman, a man who ordered this memberment of a Washington Post journalist, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1938.8s)]
*  not to mention all the other things he's done to create human suffering inside of Saudi Arabia [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1944.0s)]
*  and his neighborhood. Those people pocketed those checks and now they get to come back into the fold. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1947.28s)]
*  Right? So those people won and the people that took the right stand on these issues, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1953.84s)]
*  they're affinity for the PGA tour, whether it's because they had some qualms with signing up for [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1959.28s)]
*  the Live Tour, those people get punished. They had a golf star named Rory McIlroy [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1963.28s)]
*  leading the PR offensive against the Live Tour, doing all these press conferences. I think it [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1968.3999999999999s)]
*  definitely seemed to harm his play, maybe harm his mental health. He was taking all these shots [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1973.4399999999998s)]
*  from Live and at Live and now they hung him out to dry completely. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1979.6799999999998s)]
*  Hung him out to dry. Then the main point here is this is just showing the worst version of what [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1982.88s)]
*  MBS probably thinks, which is at the end of the day, everybody's for sale and none of it matters. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1990.96s)]
*  Nothing matters. What you say about 9-11 doesn't matter. What you say about Jamal Khashoggi doesn't [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=1996.3200000000002s)]
*  matter. What you say about brutal suppression inside of Saudi Arabia doesn't matter. What you [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2000.4s)]
*  say about the war in Yemen doesn't matter. What the US government, what Joe Biden says is a [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2003.92s)]
*  presidential candidate making him a prior. None of it matters because at the end of the day, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2008.0s)]
*  they're going to win because they have the money to win. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2012.08s)]
*  Now, I mentioned you, we're going beyond the state of sports washing, which we've talked about is [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2015.6s)]
*  the reputation laundering from hosting events and just having their brand associated with these [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2021.1999999999998s)]
*  sports to just kind of buying these. They're buying players, they're buying franchises, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2026.24s)]
*  they're buying golf tours. They're dealing with Trump and they get away with it all because they [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2031.6s)]
*  have money. Until people decide to care about something more than money, this will continue [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2037.84s)]
*  to happen. They're going to be making plays into soccer. They're going to be increasingly [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2041.68s)]
*  aggressive, get more players, get more teams. They might get Lionel Messi. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2046.0800000000002s)]
*  They might get into other American sports leagues and franchises. This is just where it's going. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2048.8s)]
*  The PGA tour that had seemed to take a stand, that was about something other than money, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2056.16s)]
*  turns out they were just kind of leveraging a deal out of the Saudis to get a big payday. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2063.04s)]
*  The grossest thing I saw is some guy saying, once I had this meeting with my Saudi counterpart [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2067.76s)]
*  in Venice, and by the way, not Venice, California, then I knew everything was going to be okay. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2072.4s)]
*  What are you talking about, bro? Yeah, they took a brave stand for [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2078.32s)]
*  about a year. There's one theory that the PGA tour caved because they couldn't afford to compete with [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2081.28s)]
*  the Saudis in court and they were worried about what could come out in discovery about their [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2086.4s)]
*  quote, not-for-profit status as an organization. That's something to be mindful of. Then there was [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2090.96s)]
*  a statement released though by the 9-11 Families United National Chair, Terri Strada. She lost her [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2096.88s)]
*  husband on 9-11. She said, PGA Commissioner Jay Monahan co-opted the 9-11 community last year [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2102.8s)]
*  in the PGA's unequivocal agreement that the Saudi Lib project was nothing more than sportswashing [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2108.08s)]
*  of Saudi Arabia's reputation, but now the PGA and Monahan appear to have become just more paid [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2112.8s)]
*  Saudi shills. Pretty well said. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2118.32s)]
*  Seems accurate. Better rant than mine. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2120.32s)]
*  We should note that Secretary of State Tony Blinken is going to Saudi Arabia June 6th through [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2122.08s)]
*  8th, so today, tomorrow, the next day. He is going to talk to them about Saudi Arabia maybe [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2127.2s)]
*  normalizing relations with Israel. The New York Times says that would require a US security [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2132.96s)]
*  guarantee to defend Saudi Arabia from future attacks, including from Iran, and US help building [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2138.24s)]
*  a civil nuclear power program in Saudi Arabia and more weapons sales. Let's hope those talks don't [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2144.08s)]
*  go very far because I'm not totally sure what we'd get out of it. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2150.88s)]
*  Well, if it's just normalization with Israel, then it's just Israel gets something. The Saudis [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2154.1600000000003s)]
*  get a lot. Yeah, both get embassies. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2159.76s)]
*  Yeah, we'd have to see what's in it for- We get to pay a ton of money and maybe get [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2161.76s)]
*  dragged into a war. Yeah. I mean, that's obviously a space to watch here because that's where this [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2165.76s)]
*  discussion is going. Again, the geopolitical context is I think the US is concerned about what [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2172.6400000000003s)]
*  happens if the Saudis pick up all their toys and all their money and just go fully into the China [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2177.68s)]
*  Russia camp. That's kind of lurking in the backdrop of this too. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2183.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Meanwhile, the Saudis are cutting oil production because prices are going down and [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2186.3999999999996s)]
*  they can't let that happen. Yeah. There's more to it, I think, than just Abraham and Cord. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2191.2s)]
*  Let's take a quick break and we come back. We're going to talk about Henry Kissinger. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2198.0s)]

*  be a bigger validator. Well, he probably is. He just turned 100 years old. That has sparked a big [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2439.6s)]
*  round of media coverage and parties and celebrations of his life and career. Parties that we should add [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2444.72s)]
*  were attended by several people that we used to work with, that we know well, that we love and [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2450.88s)]
*  respect. Podcast guests. Podcast guests. The Kissinger celebrations started about a month ago. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2455.52s)]
*  I happened to be watching CBS Sunday morning and caught live this shockingly fawning piece [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2463.28s)]
*  about Kissinger that made my blood boil. I can't remember if I whined about it to you on the show [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2469.76s)]
*  or just via text in Twitter, but it was a piece by Ted Koppel. It's 90% about what a genius, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2475.84s)]
*  it's like hagiography and about the statesman and the genius of Henry Kissinger. Here's the lone [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2483.2000000000003s)]
*  section of criticism. Here's a clip. A public figure who has shaped an era. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2488.4s)]
*  What will history's judgment be? Kissinger's career has been one of extraordinary achievement [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2494.32s)]
*  and relentless controversy. The bombing of Cambodia, the war in Vietnam, Argentina, Chile. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2501.52s)]
*  Many of his critics were not even alive when the events they condemned occurred. There are people [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2514.08s)]
*  at our broadcast who are questioning the legitimacy of even doing an interview [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2520.96s)]
*  with you. They feel that strongly about what they consider, I'll put it in language, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2528.24s)]
*  they would use your criminality. That's a reflection of their ignorance. It wasn't [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2535.2799999999997s)]
*  conceived that way, wasn't conducted that way. Look, there is no question when you and [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2547.8399999999997s)]
*  President Nixon conceived of the bombing of Cambodia, you did it in order to interdict— [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2555.7599999999998s)]
*  Come on. We have been bombing with drones and all kinds of weapons. Every guerrilla unit that we [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2564.96s)]
*  were opposing, it's been the same in every administration of either party. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2575.52s)]
*  The consequences in Cambodia were particular— [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2581.76s)]
*  Come on now. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2586.0s)]
*  No, no, no. We're particular— [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2586.8s)]
*  Look, this is a program you're doing because I'm going to be 100 years old. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2588.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2594.4s)]
*  And you're picking a topic of something that happened 60 years ago. You have to know that it [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2595.0400000000004s)]
*  was a necessary step. Now the younger generation feels that if they can raise their emotions, [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2601.76s)]
*  they don't have to think if they think. They won't ask that question. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2610.7200000000003s)]
*  So Ben, some what about-ism on steroids, probably Viagra is well there. Had you heard that before? [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2616.0800000000004s)]
*  Have you seen this segment? [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2622.7200000000003s)]
*  I've not. I actually saw the Isaac Chautner interview of Ted Koppel about this segment. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2624.2400000000002s)]
*  Yes. So I'm embarrassed to say when I watched it, I thought that it was George Will and not Ted [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2628.96s)]
*  Koppel because they kind of look alike and sound alike and I thought it had to be from kind of a [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2633.76s)]
*  neocon perspective. But you're right. Isaac Chautner and New Yorker interviewed Ted Koppel [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2638.08s)]
*  about the segment and it did not go well for Ted Koppel. So Ben, let's just divide this into two [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2642.3199999999997s)]
*  parts. Let's talk about Kissinger's record, why people detest him for lack of a better word, [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2647.12s)]
*  and then the question of accountability for people who worked in government. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2653.44s)]
*  So in terms of Kissinger's record at the risk of sounding like I'm doing just a liberal screed, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2656.16s)]
*  should we start with Kissinger sabotaging Vietnam peace talks and extending the war for five years? [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2662.96s)]
*  Do you want to start with the secret bombing of Cambodia that killed 150,000 civilians? [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2668.7200000000003s)]
*  Do you want to talk about genocides in Bangladesh, East Timor, coups in Latin America? Where to begin? [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2674.08s)]
*  I mean, let's begin because I think we need to get to all that because this is where we're digging [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2679.76s)]
*  into. This is kind of the heart of this podcast, actually, this conversation that we're about to [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2686.48s)]
*  have. If you talk about Vietnam, you're not wrong that that war escalated under Lyndon Johnson, [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2690.24s)]
*  like that war was well on the way to killing a lot of people in the United States and even [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2699.3599999999997s)]
*  more people obviously in Southeast Asia. There's a number of things worth identifying here. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2705.12s)]
*  One is that in 1968, there were peace talks and there was a kind of a peace agreement kind of on [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2710.3199999999997s)]
*  the table and there were kind of backdoor communications from the Nixon campaign, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2715.84s)]
*  which Kissinger is a part of, saying, don't make that agreement, wait for us, blah, blah, blah. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2721.6000000000004s)]
*  Because they didn't want to help Hubert Humphrey. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2726.2400000000002s)]
*  Yes, they didn't want to have a peace agreement to help him. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2727.92s)]
*  They get elected and what do they do? The war continues for five more years, as you said. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2730.88s)]
*  During that, the bombing of places like Laos and Cambodia goes up dramatically. I've been to Laos. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2736.0s)]
*  I've been to the most heavily bombed parts of Laos where to this day, children are still picking [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2743.52s)]
*  up cluster munitions and getting their fucking arms blown off because of that bombing. Those [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2747.84s)]
*  are human beings. Henry Kissinger wants to say that the young people that were born after this [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2752.4s)]
*  happened don't know what happened. You know who knows what happened? The young people in Laos who [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2757.7599999999998s)]
*  continue to get their fucking arms blown off because of the bombs he dropped, they decided [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2762.4s)]
*  on the way out, their theory was to preserve US credibility because we were not going to win this [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2767.7599999999998s)]
*  war. We basically had to bomb the shit out of these countries to send a message to anybody else, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2772.08s)]
*  not to cross the United States. The peace deal that they got at the end of the day, [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2777.2s)]
*  that Henry Kissinger got the Nobel Peace Prize for, was basically the same fucking deal that [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2781.04s)]
*  they could have had in 1968. Tens of thousands of Americans died, millions of people in Vietnam and [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2785.44s)]
*  Laos and Cambodia died. The Khmer Rouge ends up taking power in a completely chaotic and destroyed [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2790.7999999999997s)]
*  Cambodia, kills another million people. He draws this equivalency, everybody should hold drones, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2795.6s)]
*  yeah hold us accountable. But we're talking about millions of people. We're not talking about drone [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2803.92s)]
*  strikes, we are talking about indiscriminate bombing of civilians and children for the sake of [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2809.92s)]
*  credibility to get a better deal that was no different than the deal they could have had. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2816.64s)]
*  Right, so to give a couple more numbers here, this is from a great piece on Kissinger and the [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2819.52s)]
*  Intercept. Between 1969 and 73, when Kissinger was national security advisor, the U.S. dropped [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2822.4s)]
*  500,000 or more tons of munitions on Cambodia. During all of World War II, including the atomic [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2828.96s)]
*  bombings, the United States dropped around 160,000 tons of munitions on Japan. So that just gives you [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2835.44s)]
*  the scale of the indiscriminate carpet bombing. Yeah, so that's, I mean, that's what I have to say [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2840.2400000000002s)]
*  about that. I mean, the Latin America piece, you know, basically under the guise of anti-communism, [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2847.52s)]
*  supporting the dirty war in Argentina, which the torturing and disappearance of civilians. In Chile, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2855.2000000000003s)]
*  Kissinger, we have tapes, right? This is not like theoretical, there are tapes, right? [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2862.48s)]
*  Not disputed in any way. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2866.6400000000003s)]
*  On one of the tapes in describing his support for a coup in Chile, Kissinger says, quote, [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2867.36s)]
*  the issues are much too important for the Chilean voters to be left to decide for themselves. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2872.88s)]
*  Just think of how haunting that quote is, right? And so then he supports a coup that puts [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2878.88s)]
*  Pinochet in charge, a dictator who governs for the next couple of decades. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2883.04s)]
*  Again, like people could argue that the cause of fighting communism and winning the Cold War [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2887.2000000000003s)]
*  was so important, but we can't ignore that this happened, you know? What we try to, I think, [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2891.92s)]
*  bring to this podcast is the perspective that yes, foreign policy is interesting and important [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2898.64s)]
*  and tough and usually involves contradictions and trade-offs and sometimes in search of a [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2902.8799999999997s)]
*  greater goal like winning the Cold War, you do some ugly things. But, you know, the cost of that [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2907.12s)]
*  is delegitimizing America's support for democracy because people across the world, particularly in [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2913.2s)]
*  the global south, we have conversations today on this podcast about why people in the global south [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2918.4s)]
*  don't side with us on Ukraine. This is why, because they don't believe the United States when we talk [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2922.72s)]
*  about things, because they've heard tapes of people like Henry Kissinger saying, [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2927.84s)]
*  it's too much important to let the voters decide, US foreign policy should decide. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2930.88s)]
*  In the bombing of Cambodia, that was kept secret from the American public, [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2934.0s)]
*  from the US Congress, from people in the Pentagon. And Kissinger also has a uniquely direct role in [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2937.2000000000003s)]
*  these events. He not just was there at these meetings, he was helping make the policy, [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2943.52s)]
*  he was helping choose targets in Cambodia. Like Pentagon staff would come over to the White House [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2947.92s)]
*  and he'd be like, bomb there, bomb there, bomb here. This guy was directly involved. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2953.6s)]
*  We won't dig into it in more detail, but Kissinger also, his record is so long that he turned a blind [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2960.0s)]
*  eye towards Pakistan's slaughter of Bengalis. He gave the green light to Indonesia's invasion [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2965.2799999999997s)]
*  of East Timor, resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2971.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, both of those are basically ethnic cleansing situations. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2974.4s)]
*  Yeah, genocidal ethnic cleansing. So the list goes on and on. That's why he's sort of, I think, [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2976.56s)]
*  seen as a uniquely evil figure in the US by a lot of people. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2980.72s)]
*  But, good. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2986.08s)]
*  And the only one thing, because there is a positive record, we'll get to. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2987.2s)]
*  Yes, go for it. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2989.8399999999997s)]
*  It's important, so if it's in China, but you should tee that up. The only one thing I say about this [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2990.56s)]
*  is that Koppel and a lot of these people, they'll frame it as like, critics say that these things, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2993.52s)]
*  no. This is objective reality. These are people's lives, right? And so I just think it's worth [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=2999.12s)]
*  calling out this whole, your critics call you this, but everybody else says you're a genius. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3005.3599999999997s)]
*  These aren't critics. These are like, this is reality. Like, ask a person in Laos, [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3010.32s)]
*  ask a person in Chile, ask a person in Cambodia, ask a person in East Timor, ask a person in [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3014.0s)]
*  Bangladesh. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3017.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. I could see your face. People couldn't see it because it's a podcast, obviously. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3018.24s)]
*  You reacted the same thing I did that enraged me when I watched that CBS piece, which was, [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3021.84s)]
*  they're showing photos of Code Pink protesters and they're like, [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3026.72s)]
*  his critics weren't even alive when some of these events occurred. That's somehow relevant? [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3029.6s)]
*  We can't read a book? [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3033.84s)]
*  That's what really got me because we're not fucking idiots. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3034.64s)]
*  I mean, there's a dripping disdain for people that- [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3037.76s)]
*  That are anti-war usually. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3044.4s)]
*  And again, we should get to the positive side of the record. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3045.2000000000003s)]
*  Let's just do it. Positive side, right? It's sort of a rapprochement with China. He led those [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3048.0s)]
*  efforts that got Nixon to China. I think he helped as a professor get our nuclear policy [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3052.4s)]
*  in a less insane place and helped with nuclear disarmament. What else would you add there? [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3058.4s)]
*  To me, the two big ones are essentially the detente with China that led to normalization [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3064.24s)]
*  of relations with China that really did contribute to the end of the Cold War and obviously [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3069.7599999999998s)]
*  opened up the gates to Chinese economic reforms, which led to efforts to lift [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3073.7599999999998s)]
*  hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in China. Henry Kissinger deserves some credit for [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3078.48s)]
*  that. We're obviously now living with the Chinese Communist Party is still deeper entrenched and [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3082.3199999999997s)]
*  is that going to be, it'll take another couple hundred years to know whether that was- [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3088.16s)]
*  70s Kissinger might think that's a mixed bag. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3092.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. But that historic achievement, detente with the Soviet Union, basically that [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3093.92s)]
*  work Kissinger did as an academic and then as a national security advisor and secretary of state [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3101.0400000000004s)]
*  and leads into the arms control era of the 70s and 80s, lowering the risk of nuclear war. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3105.0400000000004s)]
*  That's important. That's hugely consequential and smart things. Part of what I notice in [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3111.5200000000004s)]
*  Kissinger's record is the great power stuff, like when he's dealing with people that are [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3118.0s)]
*  near his weight class, it's about diplomacy, it's about detente. It's the lack of regard for [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3123.44s)]
*  the less powerful, the smaller countries, the people that don't get a voice at Ted Koppel's [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3130.64s)]
*  programs or at gala parties at New York Public Library. That's what is to me complicated, [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3137.44s)]
*  not just about Kissinger, but about American foreign policy generally. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3143.2s)]
*  Our successes tend to be about our own interests or managing great power relations, [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3147.8399999999997s)]
*  but the record as it relates to what we say are our values in these other places, [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3153.7599999999998s)]
*  I just don't know how you can square any of us that signed up to serve in American foreign policy [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3158.7999999999997s)]
*  and you and I did, have to accept some hypocrisy, have to accept some contradictions. But Henry [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3163.52s)]
*  Kissinger made that not just an art form, it was like he's the avatar of that. I don't think [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3168.48s)]
*  that's something to celebrate. I just don't. Indifferent to the harm caused to civilians. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3175.36s)]
*  I think that this conversation around Kissinger folds into a broader conversation about [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3180.48s)]
*  accountability for people who served in government and the challenges we've had about finding what's [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3185.92s)]
*  right there. We've talked about this when it comes to the architects of the Iraq War and the Cooked [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3190.8s)]
*  Intelligence Basis, the CIA torture program. I suspect there's a very good chance that our kids [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3197.04s)]
*  will one day yell at us about Obama's use of drones. How would you have been in the room [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3203.2s)]
*  when these things happened? Honestly, good. They should. That's a good thing. I think this [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3206.88s)]
*  conversation is important. I do think since Nixon was impeached, we have done a terrible job with [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3210.0s)]
*  accountability as a country. You can look at Iran-Contra, you can look at Trump's impeachment [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3218.0s)]
*  proceedings and the lack of any kind of real outcome there. That's not to say you can't learn [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3223.68s)]
*  a lot from Kissinger. There's people out there saying, oh, Tony Blinken interviewed him for his [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3229.8399999999997s)]
*  thesis when he was in college. Well, of course he should. This guy was in the room when decisions [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3236.3999999999996s)]
*  were made. He's the most powerful figure in the history of American foreign policy. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3240.96s)]
*  Right. I'm not suggesting that you need to throw shit at him on his 100th birthday, [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3244.3199999999997s)]
*  but I do think the way he's being celebrated right now in the CBS piece, in these parties, [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3250.08s)]
*  in a lot of the media, is part of a broader story about frustration with kind of chumminess in [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3256.0s)]
*  elite circles in government and business and media and the impunity of powerful people. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3262.3199999999997s)]
*  He is the poster boy. Yeah. We didn't get into the fact that when he left government, [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3268.72s)]
*  he talks about the last four years, what he's been doing is profiting by setting up one of these, [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3272.72s)]
*  he consults corporations and governments. Nobody knows who, but he's kind of created this revolving [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3277.04s)]
*  door like lucrative business. He was going to be on the 9-11 commission, but resigned because he [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3282.64s)]
*  would have had to disclose his clients. Yeah. And he put those interests over the interests of getting [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3287.7599999999998s)]
*  fired. I mean, I guess the way to tie this in a bow, and it's such an important conversation, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3292.96s)]
*  is like, you're right, like just saying, let's cancel Henry Kissinger or even having some [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3299.04s)]
*  expectation that he'll be prosecuted as a war criminal. There's a lot of challenges with that. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3305.84s)]
*  And a lot of people who serve in the US government would be opening up a lot of cans of worms. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3313.76s)]
*  I would say the list that we went through at the beginning of this is very, that's a different [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3318.08s)]
*  level of magnitude than anything that's happened recently with the possible exception of the [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3327.52s)]
*  Iraq War. But also somewhere in between being prosecuted as a war criminal and being feted [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3331.44s)]
*  as an oracle and a genius and celebrating every editorial page and gala after gala and getting [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3341.28s)]
*  softball interviews, there's somewhere in between those two things. And the two problems I have are, [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3347.04s)]
*  one, the degree to which our establishments wrap their arms around Henry Kissinger, [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3351.92s)]
*  it's why people are cynical. It's why people are cynical about politics. It's why people are [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3357.84s)]
*  cynical about establishments. It contributes to the people like Trump. When Trump comes out and [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3363.2000000000003s)]
*  says, remember back in 2016, well, we have some killers too, it proves Trump right when it suggests [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3367.04s)]
*  that Henry Kissinger is going to get the biggest foot rub in the world for his birthday party. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3373.52s)]
*  And the other thing is it'd be different if Henry Kissinger showed any degree of self-reflection [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3378.1600000000003s)]
*  on this. I mean, we sit here and beat the shit out of ourselves about these things. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3382.48s)]
*  Has he... He should go to Laos and look at those places where those bombs still are. He should go [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3386.56s)]
*  to Cambodia. He has not done that. Instead, he gets defensive and says, we had to do it. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3391.6s)]
*  He didn't have to do those things. And he's made no effort to come to terms with them or to try to [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3395.68s)]
*  see the world from the eyes of those people. And I would hope that the people that go to those [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3400.08s)]
*  birthday parties, in addition to doing that, that they make themselves look at the world from the [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3403.8399999999997s)]
*  eyes of a Gabriel Boric, a president of Chile today, or of someone in Laos, because that's what [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3408.7999999999997s)]
*  too often the US foreign policy establishment refuses to do. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3414.72s)]
*  Yeah. Speaking of lack of accountability, let's talk about Donald Trump. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3417.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3421.12s)]
*  We're going long today, and I guess that's just okay. So a couple updates just on the [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3421.4399999999996s)]
*  hoarding of classified documents. So first, this week, Trump's lawyers met with Special Counsel [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3425.2s)]
*  Jack Smith and other prosecutors at the Department of Justice about the case. Mayor Garland did not [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3429.2799999999997s)]
*  attend. The Attorney General did not attend. The Washington Post reported that during this meeting, [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3434.48s)]
*  Trump's lawyers said they believe their client is being treated unfairly, a surprise, and urged [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3438.3199999999997s)]
*  DOJ not to prosecute him. NBC News reported that a federal grand jury in Florida is meeting this [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3442.88s)]
*  week to hear more evidence in the case. CNN reported that an employee at Mar-a-Lago drained [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3447.2000000000003s)]
*  the resort's swimming pool last October and ended up flooding the room where the servers containing [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3452.1600000000003s)]
*  the video surveillance logs were kept. I hate when that happens, but luckily the IT equipment [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3457.76s)]
*  wasn't damaged. The guy who drained the pool is a maintenance worker who also helped Trump's body [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3462.4s)]
*  man move classified boxes before the DOJ subpoena was served. The Post says Special Counsel Jack [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3467.52s)]
*  Smith has audio of Trump bragging about having a classified plan to attack Iran during an interview [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3473.44s)]
*  with two guys writing a biography of Mark Meadows. They now can't find that document, although it [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3478.7200000000003s)]
*  seems like he was waving it around in the meeting. There's other audio that demonstrates, you know, [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3483.28s)]
*  that audio actually demonstrates that Trump knew the information had not been declassified. There's [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3487.6s)]
*  other audio from his lawyers that talks about classified documents. Yeah, so I don't know, man, [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3491.52s)]
*  what else do we need to discuss? If he does not get indicted soon, I will be shocked. There's so [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3496.08s)]
*  much evidence that they obstructed justice and have this information. And it was important [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3500.48s)]
*  information. I talked too much in this podcast, right? I'm going to ask you some questions here, [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3504.0s)]
*  first of all. First of all, what is the Mark Meadows biography? I had the same exact- [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3507.84s)]
*  Who's the audience for that? Apparently two people are working on, I think it's an autobiography, [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3516.96s)]
*  so it must have been his ghost writers writing a book about Mark Meadows. Yeah. Say, I want to put [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3520.48s)]
*  in the context, like they're talking about a war plan, maybe an Iranian war plan. Do you recall [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3525.28s)]
*  like a leak investigation around, I don't know, potential cyber alleged US cyber operations against [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3530.88s)]
*  Iran? Pretty intense one. Yeah. Remember having to talk to the FBI about it. Yeah, I do too, [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3537.92s)]
*  because the point is that that is incredibly sensitive material. It's sensitive as it gets. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3541.84s)]
*  That the US government would go after people, prosecute people, pursue people over just a hint [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3547.36s)]
*  of this. And if he's just walking around with war plans and then draining tools to try to get [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3552.88s)]
*  moving shit around and kind of cover it up, that's not nothing, right? Yeah, there's a suggestion [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3557.2000000000003s)]
*  that maybe the classified documents he'd taken were like, oh, the letters to Kim Jong-un or [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3560.48s)]
*  trip memos or whatever, like intel about foreign leaders saying nice things about him. No, [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3565.52s)]
*  the Iran war plan is getting waved around in a meeting. And I guess the basic point here is that [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3570.4s)]
*  last question to ask is if you're able to walk out with war plans and try to destroy things with [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3576.64s)]
*  pool water or move shit around and then just kind of get away with it, what message does that send [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3584.56s)]
*  about any employee that wants to walk out of the US government? Back to our accountability point. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3589.44s)]
*  I mean, total impunity for all these actions. The obstruction of justice hopefully will make [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3595.36s)]
*  it impossible for DOJ not to prosecute. Yeah. I mean, I just don't know how you can allow this [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3599.68s)]
*  to stand. And nevermind the questions that remain to be answered that I hope Jack Smith can get at [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3604.08s)]
*  given this crew as to whether or not this Saudi nexus and this, who might be interested in the [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3610.08s)]
*  Iranian war plan? Saudis. Saudis. Who might be interested in getting leverage over Trump Saudis? [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3615.6s)]
*  Right? So I hope that that's a part of this conversation. Yeah, me too. The Intercept [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3622.16s)]
*  reported that the Pakistani military invited the owners of the country's largest media organizations [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3626.48s)]
*  to a meeting and then ordered them to stop covering former Prime Minister Imran Khan. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3632.32s)]
*  That directive was passed down to journalists who lead to the Intercept among others. And it's also [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3637.04s)]
*  just been confirmed that Khan has basically vanished from the news in Pakistan. Remember that [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3643.04s)]
*  Imran Khan was pushed out of the prime minister's job in a no confidence vote last April. That vote [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3648.32s)]
*  was widely seen as orchestrated by the Pakistani military. Khan has been engaged in this furious [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3654.0s)]
*  PR campaign ever since, blaming his ouster on the US, saying it was some sort of Western coup. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3659.68s)]
*  He demanded his supporters take to the streets. He was finally arrested on corruption charges [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3664.3199999999997s)]
*  last month. Erasing Khan's name from the news would basically be like US outlets one day just [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3668.96s)]
*  not covering Donald Trump anymore. I'm sure there are listeners thinking, oh, that sounds wonderful, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3676.7999999999997s)]
*  but I assure you it would not be cool if the Pentagon was the one dictating that editorial [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3681.52s)]
*  decision, which seems to be happening in Pakistan. Well, and also it's proven to be a horrible [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3686.64s)]
*  strategy. All time backfire. Everything that the Pakistani military has done to shut up or to evict [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3690.7999999999997s)]
*  Imran Khan from politics, it's just made him more powerful and made him stronger. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3699.3599999999997s)]
*  This will backfire spectacularly, is my guess, because Imran Khan seems to have a way around [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3705.52s)]
*  all of these things. This is a guy, by the way, that was not an effective prime minister, [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3711.68s)]
*  but he's a populist leader. His approval is going up now. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3718.72s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Their effort to silence him is only contributing to his... Guess what people [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3721.2s)]
*  don't like? They don't like the corrupt deep military state in Pakistan. If he's seen as [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3726.08s)]
*  the victim of that, it's only to strengthen him. Yeah. A couple of quicker headlines to close this [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3731.9199999999996s)]
*  out here. The AP reported that Iran is building a new nuclear facility deep enough in the side of a [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3735.6s)]
*  mountain that it could be beyond the reach of even US weapons designed to blow up these heavily [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3740.4s)]
*  fortified targets. Another part of the Trump legacy, pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3745.04s)]
*  Congratulations. Yeah. Exactly. It comes as Iran's uranium stockpile is over 10 times what it was [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3748.56s)]
*  during the Iran deal when the Obama deal was in place, and talks to get Iran back into the deal [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3754.7200000000003s)]
*  seem dead. On Tuesday, Iran unveiled what they claim is a hypersonic missile, so I'm sure that'll [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3760.0s)]
*  flip everybody out. Again, yeah, one of the bigger cell phones in US foreign policy history, pulling [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3764.8s)]
*  out of JCPOA. Yeah. It's interesting, because it's Iran, there's not really accountability. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3769.84s)]
*  It gets back to your accountability point. There's not really accountability. We've talked about the [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3777.28s)]
*  Venezuela policy, failed spectacularly. The Iran policy's failed spectacularly. If your policy [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3781.6000000000004s)]
*  fails against a Washington boogeyman, it doesn't matter as long as you were taking wax at that [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3788.1600000000003s)]
*  boogeyman. You don't see Tom Cotton writing op-eds being like, the JCPOA was working, I was wrong to [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3794.0s)]
*  say we should have pulled out of it. Yeah, or you don't see people saying, how could we ever allow [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3799.44s)]
*  the people that were the authors of the withdrawal from the Iran deal to ever serve in government [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3804.32s)]
*  again, because this is such a big cell phone. Something tells me it's harder if you worked on [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3808.32s)]
*  the Iran deal to get confirmed in Congress than it is if you were part of pulling out of it. No doubt. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3814.2400000000002s)]
*  Officials in Afghanistan believe that nearly 90 school girls were poisoned along with their [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3820.56s)]
*  teachers. The victims reported nausea, shortness of breath, and headaches. Local officials blamed [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3825.28s)]
*  maybe intra-village rivalries for this happening. Others suspect the Taliban was behind it. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3831.2000000000003s)]
*  There have been similar incidents in Afghanistan before, in 2012 and 2016. More recently, [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3836.88s)]
*  hundreds of school girls in Iran got sick earlier this year in what some Iranian officials thought [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3842.8s)]
*  was a deliberate wave of poisonings. This obviously comes after the Taliban took control of [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3848.0800000000004s)]
*  Afghanistan in 2021 and have severely restricted women's rights, including prohibiting girls from [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3852.96s)]
*  attending school after sixth grade. So again, these were very young girls who may have been poisoned [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3858.16s)]
*  just for going to school. Yeah. You were a sick fuck if you were doing that. And I mean, [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3863.84s)]
*  like it just, it speaks to a level of nihilism, like embedded in a faction of the Taliban and [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3870.96s)]
*  their society that like we can't, you know, it's hard to get your mind around that. I mean, [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3876.88s)]
*  and it speaks to the need to continue to spotlight what's going on there. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3882.72s)]
*  Yeah. Last thing before Ben's interview. So British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is in Washington this [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3886.3199999999997s)]
*  week. It's his first official visit. He's going to hang out with President Biden, members of Congress, [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3891.4399999999996s)]
*  business leaders, and he's apparently planning to go to a baseball game between the Nationals and [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3896.72s)]
*  the Arizona Diamondbacks. Ben, it is UK-US friendship day at Nats Park. I was going to make [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3901.7599999999998s)]
*  fun of this and act like at Fenway, we just have like, you know, like beer night and bleacher [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3908.16s)]
*  brawls. But then I Googled it. It turns out we do a lot of these events. April 16th was Cocoa Melon [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3913.2s)]
*  Day at Fenway. For those of you who don't have young kids, you might not know Cocoa Melon, [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3918.72s)]
*  but you will. So I'll shut up. So lots of speculation though about whether Sunak will [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3922.3199999999997s)]
*  throw out the first pitch. That's what I was going to ask you. So the Daily Mail is reporting that [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3928.0s)]
*  staff at number 10 are very worried about it because they don't want him to pull a Dr. Fauci [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3932.24s)]
*  and airmail the thing like 15 feet outside the batter's box. What do you think? I mean, do you [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3937.6s)]
*  think, first of all, does Rishi play sports? I think I read that he might've played cricket. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3942.72s)]
*  Yeah, which would be practice. Like Rishi Strickland is the kind of guy that would practice [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3946.72s)]
*  for like a really long time for that pitch. Remember Obama practiced a lot. Yeah. And it [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3952.0s)]
*  still doesn't always work out. But you have an arm or you don't. You either have an arm or you [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3957.12s)]
*  don't. Like what does he wear is important. Like you're wearing a bulletproof vest. Is he wearing [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3961.04s)]
*  the skinny tie and the tight shirt or is he trying to do sportswear? It's just hard for me [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3964.8s)]
*  to see him being like an authentic American jock type baseball player, but we'll see. Yeah, he [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3972.8s)]
*  looks in shape. I don't know about athletic. It's kind of a metaphor for the entire thing. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3980.6400000000003s)]
*  He'll probably do better at this than Boris Johnson or Liz Trust would have done, [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3987.1200000000003s)]
*  but it still won't be that good. Very, very true. I'm wicking him right now. I'm trying to look [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3992.4s)]
*  for something sporting in his early life. This is great radio right now. Who knows? I guess what I [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=3996.96s)]
*  would tell them is you don't need to throw off the mount. You know, like I think you can get plenty [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4004.8s)]
*  of press just for going to the game, just for being seen with the right people. I mean, maybe [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4009.92s)]
*  he'll go with Joe Biden. I have no idea. Maybe he'll go with Dr. Jill Biden. We did Obama and [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4013.84s)]
*  David Cameron went to a basketball game, right? Yeah, they went to an NCAA tournament play-in game [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4019.52s)]
*  in Dayton, Ohio. Tommy, you and I both contributed to the planning for that trip and went on that [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4026.24s)]
*  trip just to show that we are not above cynical politics. The selection of Dayton, Ohio in a [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4031.2s)]
*  presidential election cycle. Total happens to answer. Totally coincident that we decided to [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4038.16s)]
*  fly there on Air Force One with the British Prime Minister. David Cameron, by the way, [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4042.56s)]
*  interesting David Cameron story, had no idea what the rules of basketball were. No idea what [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4046.16s)]
*  the hell was going on. Like Obama's trying to explain, literally didn't even know like, [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4052.16s)]
*  you know, how many like nothing. And it was also like pretty, let's just say it wasn't like a high [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4055.8399999999997s)]
*  scoring game. It was a shitty game. The coolest thing I went to maybe in my entire time at the [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4060.72s)]
*  White House was in 2011, we went to the carrier classic. Do you remember this? I went to that too. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4066.96s)]
*  Basketball game. Amazing. On an aircraft carrier, the USS Carl Vinson, where we saw [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4072.8s)]
*  UNC play Michigan State. One of the coolest things I ever did. And like a great game. But also these [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4078.7200000000003s)]
*  poor kids like shooting in shooting a basketball is hard to begin with shooting when the background [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4083.6800000000003s)]
*  is like the San Diego skyline. When you're used to a gym. Yeah, it's gotta be. Yeah, [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4089.44s)]
*  Barack Obama's watching you play. Yeah, it was pretty intense. That was really cool. Yeah. And [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4094.5600000000004s)]
*  it's at the beginning of an Asia trip. We went from there to Hawaii to Australia to Bali. Yeah, [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4097.6s)]
*  that's one of those 10 day trips. Yeah, I love that. By the end, you're just like, who am I? [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4102.0s)]
*  By then you're like, Dr. Ronnie. I need all the pills. Yeah. Anyway, we miss you, Dr. Ronnie. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4105.68s)]
*  Come back to reality. Just kidding. That guy sucks. Okay, we're going to take a quick break [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4111.28s)]
*  and we come back. You'll hear Ben's interview with Tim Mack about all things Ukraine. I'm very [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4115.44s)]
*  pleased to welcome to the podcast Tim Mack, who is the founder of the counter offensive, which [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4120.08s)]
*  everybody should check out online. It's a great resource for news about the war in Ukraine. And [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4125.12s)]
*  Tim is also a crooked contributor. So Tim, welcome to Pazio the world. Thank you so much. This is my [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4130.72s)]
*  first crooked contributor appearance. So this is it's a big milestone for me. Yeah, your first [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4136.64s)]
*  activation as it were. Well, we'll look forward to hearing you across different crooked channels [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4141.6s)]
*  and platforms. But and people should follow yours. But you're in Keeve. So like everybody, [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4147.04s)]
*  we've been talking for months now about this counter offensive. And there's indications that [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4154.400000000001s)]
*  something may be gone at the front a lot of activity in the last couple of days. What are [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4160.4s)]
*  you hearing there about what's taking place and whether this is what we've all been waiting for? [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4164.48s)]
*  I'll tell you how you can have a sense that that something really big is happening is that all the [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4170.4s)]
*  folks that we've been talking to that are troops soldiers on the front lines, they suddenly don't [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4175.92s)]
*  want to talk. They're all quiet. They don't really want to discuss anything even like what they're [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4180.48s)]
*  feeling or what they think. There's been this kind of veil that falls across the frontline. And [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4185.44s)]
*  there's been this messaging, particularly from the Ministry of Defense that plans love silence. And [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4192.48s)]
*  this is kind of like the loose lips sink ships of this war. And that people are just in general, [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4197.839999999999s)]
*  not really interested in talking right now. And that's been a real departure from the past when [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4207.839999999999s)]
*  people have really wanted to tell their stories. And it's an indication at least to me as a [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4211.68s)]
*  reporter and journalist that something is happening. And then beyond that, there are clues [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4216.96s)]
*  from the Ministry of Defense, the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, one of their deputy ministers [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4222.16s)]
*  was saying that a lot of their troops are now moving from a defensive posture to an offensive [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4228.08s)]
*  posture. And then of course, there are other news items that I'm sure we'll get into that indicate [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4232.320000000001s)]
*  something big is happening on the battlefield. Both Ukrainians and the Russians have started [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4238.96s)]
*  signaling that a major counter offensive operation has begun. So in terms of what to expect, and I'm [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4245.04s)]
*  going to get into the different dimensions because there's political dimensions to this and [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4252.88s)]
*  psychological dimensions as well with this war. But just in terms of the physical sense of this, [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4256.08s)]
*  you talked about people not talking, which is an important indication. In the past, [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4263.04s)]
*  you know, the last time there was a major offensive, we saw kind of an initial [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4267.92s)]
*  focus on the south around Kyrgyzstan, but then this kind of surprise movement in the northeast [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4273.76s)]
*  around Kharkiv. It seems like the priority, at least certainly the priority from the US perspective, [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4280.160000000001s)]
*  is breaking that land bridge that connects Eastern Ukraine down to Crimea through Southern Ukraine. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4286.8s)]
*  Do you get any sense? It seems like first of all, there's pretty good operational security on this [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4294.08s)]
*  stuff. But do you get any sense from your sources or just your own intuition about this war, about [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4298.24s)]
*  what to expect in terms of the Ukrainian priority geographically in this counter offensive? [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4303.76s)]
*  Let's talk about what they said is their party in the immediate short term. So the [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4308.5599999999995s)]
*  ministry defenses talked about how some of the fiercest fighting still remains in the [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4313.6s)]
*  Bakhmut region in eastern Ukraine, in what's known as the Donbass. And so, [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4317.28s)]
*  what's known as the Donbass area, which has been some of the most hotly contested areas [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4322.64s)]
*  that have been contested over the last few months. There have been a lot of predictions made, [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4329.68s)]
*  and I don't want to be made a fool of. If you listen to military analysts a few months ago, [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4334.240000000001s)]
*  I guarantee you none of them said that Russia aligned fighters would be fighting in Russia right [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4339.92s)]
*  now in the Belgarad region and holding territory from the Russian state. I mean, that was a real [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4345.52s)]
*  wild card that has developed and is currently underway. There's fighting on Russian territory [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4352.48s)]
*  by Russian soldiers, Russian nationals that are aligned with the Ukrainian state. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4357.919999999999s)]
*  I think you're right that strategically it makes a lot of sense for the Ukrainians to aim to cut [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4364.959999999999s)]
*  up the land bridge. And there's not only a general military sense of that, there's also a big moral [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4370.5599999999995s)]
*  and emotional sense to it. You'll think back over the course of this war, some of the most [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4378.4s)]
*  important stories involve things like the siege of Azovstal in Mariupol. That some of the most [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4385.92s)]
*  emotional and important stories that the Ukrainians have to tell among themselves are the people who [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4393.44s)]
*  sacrificed in order to resist the Russian invasion in the early days and then continue to resist even [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4398.48s)]
*  when it looked to be hopeless. And that's at the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol. And so there's [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4405.52s)]
*  a strategic sense to it and there's also a moral sense to it. And the Ukrainians have really been [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4412.240000000001s)]
*  focused on not only information operations, but also on convincing or trying to convince the Russians [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4421.200000000001s)]
*  that Ukrainians have a much higher sense of morale than they do. This may or may not be true. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4428.96s)]
*  I think certainly the Ukrainians have more to fight for. But if you talk to Ukrainian soldiers [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4436.240000000001s)]
*  along the front, they're exhausted just like I'm sure the Russian soldiers are. They're fighting on [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4441.84s)]
*  home turf in a lot of ways. But they're trying to eke out these moral wins, these things that [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4448.240000000001s)]
*  will boost the general confidence of the country to continue the prosecution of this war. And that's [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4456.88s)]
*  been as important in a lot of ways as strategic military victories. This is really interesting [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4462.24s)]
*  because I want to get into this. First I want to start with objectives and then I'm going to get [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4468.639999999999s)]
*  into this morale issue. On the objectives for what to expect say over the next six to nine months [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4472.5599999999995s)]
*  until things really get cold again and the front line kind of hunkers down like we saw this winter, [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4481.84s)]
*  I've been struck by the fact that probably to project morale and to attract support from the [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4489.84s)]
*  West, the Ukrainian political leadership is very maximalist. We're on the verge of victory. A great [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4494.8s)]
*  victory is coming. We had Jeff Goldberg on recently who was interviewing Zelensky and [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4501.36s)]
*  we can feel victory in the air. And yet if you talk to military analysts, I don't think anybody [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4507.68s)]
*  believes that in the next six to nine months they're going to evict Russia from Ukrainian [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4513.84s)]
*  territory absent some really dramatic collapse essentially of Russian forces. When you talk to [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4519.2s)]
*  Ukrainian sources, what is actually success in this counter offensive that has been so discussed? [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4526.88s)]
*  I almost worry as someone who's obviously pretty supportive of the Ukrainian cause here about [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4538.16s)]
*  the gap between what is potentially achievable in the battlefield and what the kind of rhetoric [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4544.08s)]
*  of victory is. Are people aware of that gap and just managing it? And what do you think success [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4548.32s)]
*  is in say this calendar year? Again, not asking to make real predictions about this exact amount [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4555.76s)]
*  of territory, but what do you think the kind of the practical military planners there think would [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4561.28s)]
*  be like a significant progress over the course of this the rest of this year? Well one of those [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4568.24s)]
*  really clear to me is that this is not a counter offensive that's being conducted out of military [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4573.68s)]
*  necessity per se. It's being conducted at this particular time out of political necessity, [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4579.68s)]
*  right? That this counter offensive is being seen by a lot of Ukraine's staunchest allies in the west [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4585.4400000000005s)]
*  as your big chance. We have given you all this aid, all this money, all this hardware. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4594.320000000001s)]
*  You need to show us something in exchange for it. You need to show significant gains. And so [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4603.04s)]
*  the Ukrainian government realizes that and is operating on more of a political timeline [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4609.76s)]
*  than on unnecessarily a military one. That's one thought I have. Another quote that I find myself [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4617.36s)]
*  continuing to go back to over and over again is a quote where the Minister of Defense Reznikov [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4624.96s)]
*  was asked a very similar question about what does victory mean? And he said something that was pretty [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4632.32s)]
*  striking to me. He said that victory means when I can, me and my wife can get on a commercial flight [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4637.36s)]
*  in Kiev and fly to Western Europe. And when we get to the Hague, I get to prosecute the war criminals [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4643.6s)]
*  who have conducted all these crimes in Ukraine. So two points, right? First is the resumption of [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4651.2s)]
*  normal economic activity in the form of commercial flights. And the second is accountability for [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4658.72s)]
*  war crimes and injustices that have happened in Ukraine over the course of the full scale invasion. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4664.8s)]
*  When he was asked about the definition of victory, he did not talk about territorial gains, losses, [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4674.32s)]
*  or situation. That restoring Ukraine to its economic potential and accountability were [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4680.8s)]
*  kind of the priorities there. And that I think, you know, maybe I'm looking too much into that [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4688.400000000001s)]
*  particular answer, but I found it to be illuminating in the sense that I think there's some understanding [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4692.72s)]
*  that, you know, that on the battlefield, not everything can be won back. At the same point, [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4697.04s)]
*  what we've seen also is that when Ukrainians push forward outside of Donbas, where there have been [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4704.96s)]
*  really steady lines for some, you know, eight years, that when Russian forces collapse, they [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4711.76s)]
*  collapse in a pretty dramatic way. You've seen that around Kiev, you've seen that around Hursom, [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4720.5599999999995s)]
*  you've seen that around Kharkiv. And that this is kind of getting back to the morale question and [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4725.36s)]
*  the information operations question, right? That when it comes to these huge victories that Ukraine [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4732.16s)]
*  has won on the battlefield, many times it's because of Russian collapse as opposed to, you know, [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4741.68s)]
*  Ukrainian military brilliance. Not that, of course, Ukrainians are fighting and dying and [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4746.32s)]
*  have shown their resourcefulness in a thousand different ways. But they've been aided by a [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4753.599999999999s)]
*  relative lack of morale on the Russian side. And when the Russian lines do collapse, they collapse [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4759.52s)]
*  in a terrific and dramatic manner. So on this morale point, which as you're identifying, is [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4765.84s)]
*  kind of central to everything from Western support for Ukraine to battlefield success, [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4775.52s)]
*  you know, we see Zelensky, you know, you're in Kiev, right? The rest of us are sitting [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4782.4800000000005s)]
*  just about anywhere else in the world. Zelensky is kind of centralized in his person, [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4787.04s)]
*  the embodiment of morale, and it's incredibly defiant and it's incredibly certain of victory. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4792.0s)]
*  But, you know, I know you talk to soldiers, you talk to people on the ground, obviously you're [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4798.48s)]
*  surrounded by Ukrainians. Is that an accurate representation of the Ukrainian mindset? Because, [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4802.639999999999s)]
*  you know, it's kind of been social media memed, right, of this kind of constant sense of Ukrainian [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4809.36s)]
*  fortitude and resilience and unity. I'm not suggesting that there's not truth to that. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4814.64s)]
*  I just know that nothing is ever that simple. And I'm just curious what your sense is on the ground [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4822.4800000000005s)]
*  of the mixture of resilience, exhaustion, is everybody behind this war, is everybody behind [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4828.08s)]
*  this political leadership, are people frustrated with the West? Like what stands out to you as the [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4833.84s)]
*  as the nature of Ukrainian morale now? And what might be areas of concern as we look ahead? [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4840.4s)]
*  I want to make a point about Zelensky and then I want to make a point about resilience. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4846.4s)]
*  So let me start with Zelensky, that he is really like deified in the West, as you mentioned. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4850.16s)]
*  And Ukrainians have this long and I think positive history of complaining constantly about their [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4856.639999999999s)]
*  leaders and their political situation, like much like Americans do, much like many people in the [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4862.5599999999995s)]
*  free world do and are responsible to do when they feel so, right? I think a lot about [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4867.84s)]
*  conversations that I've had that go kind of like this, particularly in places in central and eastern [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4874.32s)]
*  Ukraine where before the war, Zelensky was not super popular. You may remember that before the [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4882.24s)]
*  war actually his ratings were really in the toilet. I mean, that the vast majority of- [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4888.72s)]
*  Yeah, 30s, 20s and 30s, yeah. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4894.72s)]
*  Very, very, very low approval ratings. And you talk to folks there and they are unified in one [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4897.04s)]
*  sense, right? They say, look, I didn't vote for Zelensky in the last election, but I have just been [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4903.6s)]
*  blown away by how he's unified the country, his courage in staying in Kiev when his life was in [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4910.16s)]
*  personal danger and the way he's executed the war in a way that has been much better than [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4918.24s)]
*  most Ukrainians even themselves would have predicted would have happened at this point. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4926.64s)]
*  And then they let it beat pass and they say, but I wouldn't vote for him in the next election [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4932.0s)]
*  either. It's kind of like that, it reminds me of Winston Churchill in World War II where [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4939.280000000001s)]
*  as soon as the war was over, they didn't want a wartime prime minister and he didn't win [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4945.92s)]
*  re-election after World War II. Ukrainians have that kind of relationship with their leaders. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4952.0s)]
*  They're supremely skeptical. They have over the last few decades engaged in a number of [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4959.12s)]
*  color revolutions, other kinds of mass street protests in order to make change in their [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4969.04s)]
*  governance. And you get the sense that with so much sacrifice over the course of the war [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4974.0s)]
*  in last year and change that if things don't go the way they like, that they'd be ready to do [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4980.24s)]
*  it again, that there's a lot of energy in the public. So they're not exhausted in that sense. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4987.04s)]
*  There are two wars really, the two reasons why the war is being fought. One reason is the obvious [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=4996.0s)]
*  one, which is that Russia invaded and that they're fighting to defend their territory. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5000.32s)]
*  The second reason is that I think a lot of Ukrainians feel that they're fighting a war [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5006.08s)]
*  to create a more progressive, a more free, a less corrupt, more aligned with the EU kind of country [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5011.2s)]
*  and they'd be very angry, disappointed and will rally on the streets if they don't get that outcome. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5016.5599999999995s)]
*  And especially if whatever candidates are available in whatever future elections come about [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5022.5599999999995s)]
*  don't represent that version of the future. So that's my feeling on the political situation [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5028.88s)]
*  and Zelensky. On the resilience side, what I found so interesting is, well, for one, I mean, [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5034.48s)]
*  just looking at the course of the last year, I thought in the winter with no power in the city, [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5039.599999999999s)]
*  there'd be a total humanitarian disaster. People wouldn't be able to heat their homes. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5044.799999999999s)]
*  Businesses wouldn't be able to operate. Kiev would be a ghost town. And it turned out not to be, [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5048.879999999999s)]
*  right? That people were a lot more resilient than I gave them credit for. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5054.0s)]
*  People found a way to adjust their businesses, adjust their lives, adjust their transportation. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5058.4s)]
*  And continue to operate. And what's so strange about life in Kiev today is that if I were to [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5064.4s)]
*  go outside, I'd find it's a nice, warm kind of spring summer day and people are out on patios [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5069.599999999999s)]
*  drinking cocktails and eating sushi and, you know, enjoying a nice espresso or something like that. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5077.28s)]
*  And then everyone retreats to their homes around curfew and overnight as most nights in May, [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5085.44s)]
*  probably more nights than not, there are explosions everywhere in the city. And everyone gets up at [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5092.4s)]
*  two o'clock in the morning or three o'clock in the morning and, you know, it either goes to an [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5098.5599999999995s)]
*  internal corridor or to a bomb shelter or something like that. And no one sleeps well. And [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5103.04s)]
*  everyone wakes up and then you go out into the city and it's packed and people are trying to [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5107.84s)]
*  live their normal lives again. There's this enormous sense of resilience and people trying [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5111.599999999999s)]
*  to live life as it's normal. And one more point I'd make about that is that it's kind of a double [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5118.16s)]
*  edged sword. When soldiers come back from the front lines, they look at this and they say, [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5125.36s)]
*  well, these people are totally out of touch with the war that's going on, right? Like, you know, [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5130.0s)]
*  people are drinking cocktails in Kiev or in Western Ukraine, in Lviv. Have they forgotten about us [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5134.96s)]
*  and what we're enduring on the front lines in Donbass or, you know, closer to where the action [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5142.0s)]
*  is in Kherson, for example? You know, a lot of soldiers are split on this issue because on the [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5149.12s)]
*  one hand, this is the normalcy they're fighting for. This is the sort of thing that they are [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5155.5199999999995s)]
*  literally risking their lives to try to preserve. But on the other hand, that sort of [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5161.36s)]
*  the sort of pedestrian nature of life in the big cities makes them wonder if people haven't [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5167.12s)]
*  just tried to find a way around confronting the reality that there's a war happening. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5175.2s)]
*  So there's that feeling as well. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5181.76s)]
*  It's funny you mentioned this. And this just occurred to me. I was talking to this woman [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5184.08s)]
*  about a week ago who is a Ukrainian disability advocate. She's a disabled woman who was actually [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5191.28s)]
*  a model and is now runs organizations and efforts to try to promote disability rights. Because she [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5200.5599999999995s)]
*  was in, starting in 2014, she was in hospitals in the Donbass, you know, working with newly [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5208.4s)]
*  disabled troops to kind of prepare them for a life. You know, she's in a wheelchair to prepare [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5216.72s)]
*  them for that life. And just having this one conversation with her made me realize, like a big [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5221.52s)]
*  chunk of the Ukrainian, putting aside the dead, which is obviously, you know, a horrific number [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5227.92s)]
*  of Ukrainians killed, the number of men and women who are going to be wounded, who are going to be [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5234.08s)]
*  wounded, who are going to be, we've seen in our country, a very small sliver of our population [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5244.56s)]
*  suffer grievous wounds, PTSD. This is not the main event, I know, this is, but is Ukraine ready for [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5249.84s)]
*  the fact that generations of people are going to have scars, you know? And is that already manifest [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5258.08s)]
*  and people coming back with disabilities? It's something that doesn't get talked about much, but [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5265.04s)]
*  I'm trying to contrast the front line and the cafes and Kiev, as you say, the kind of in between [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5270.799999999999s)]
*  of that is, you know, relatives coming home with serious wounds. Is there a recognition of the [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5277.599999999999s)]
*  degree of trauma that is going to have to be dealt with in this society for a very long time? [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5285.04s)]
*  You know, I talk to soldiers, and you know, I'm a former soldier myself, I was a U.S. Army combat [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5289.5199999999995s)]
*  medic, and I feel I relate to them in a number of ways, but one thing that I hear a lot is that [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5294.16s)]
*  people feel a lot less stressed on the front line than they do when they're silenced at home, [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5303.12s)]
*  when they're back on the home front, and they're forced to confront and reckon with [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5308.4s)]
*  the things that they saw when the adrenaline was really pumping, you know? And I think that there's [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5313.2s)]
*  a delay in the reckoning. I think when I talk to folks about this, they say Ukraine is pretty [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5321.36s)]
*  behind even the United States when it comes to mental health issues. There's a real kind of [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5329.599999999999s)]
*  macho attitude towards it and a feeling that, you know, real men, real strong people [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5333.92s)]
*  don't need mental health when they're struggling, that they can just deal with it. And that's a [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5342.4s)]
*  mentality that's, you know, counterproductive and something that will need to change if [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5351.759999999999s)]
*  these issues are to be addressed. But there's also a generation of people who are young and [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5358.719999999999s)]
*  interested in solving the problem and nipping it in the bud who are trying to say, [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5364.799999999999s)]
*  well, hey, the way you deal with it is to talk about things and be as open and transparent with [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5368.24s)]
*  people and have that social support from your friends and family and say, you can talk to us [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5371.92s)]
*  and we're here for you. And there's that part of it too. I think that there's going to be a big delay [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5376.64s)]
*  in addressing this issue because there are more, maybe I'm not putting this in the most artful way, [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5383.84s)]
*  but to Ukrainians, there are more important issues to deal with right now. And there are more urgent [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5391.280000000001s)]
*  issues which include the physical violence that needs to be conducted in order to win this war. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5395.68s)]
*  This is an important and interesting issue to be dealt with, but really it's not a core priority. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5401.04s)]
*  And so I think there's going to be a delay in the reckoning there. And I think you're absolutely [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5410.5599999999995s)]
*  right to identify this as a huge problem, a generational problem that will challenge society [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5415.28s)]
*  here for many, many, many years once hopefully this war ends. So one more question, like on the [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5423.28s)]
*  morale side of things, we've seen these attacks into Russia that are a bit more brazen, right? [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5429.28s)]
*  There have been car bomb assassinations, there have been these drone attacks, including around [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5434.96s)]
*  the Kremlin that the US apparently believes Ukraine was behind. There's been this offensive, [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5439.84s)]
*  as you mentioned, of Russian nationalists using probably Ukrainian-provided weapons, [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5445.44s)]
*  launching cross-border attacks into Russia. How much of that is about [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5451.36s)]
*  you know, really wanting to bring the war home to Russians? [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5455.360000000001s)]
*  And how much of that is projected back home, like, see, we can bloody their nose too, [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5459.68s)]
*  is part of that strategy around these kind of pretty brazen and risky attacks? [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5463.200000000001s)]
*  Is part of that to send a message to Ukrainians back home, see, we're going to bring the war to them too? [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5467.76s)]
*  Well, look, the Ukrainians have conducted or been responsible for or supported these actions [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5472.160000000001s)]
*  despite the objections of the Americans, one of their most important and strongest allies, [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5479.76s)]
*  right? And so the United States has been pretty clear about this, which is that they don't support [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5484.8s)]
*  attacks on Russian territory, they don't condone them. And so when the Ukrainian government, [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5489.2s)]
*  which is sometimes often denied involvement in these operations, does get involved with [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5495.52s)]
*  this sort of thing, they're doing so despite the objections of their strongest and probably [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5504.0s)]
*  their most important ally. And then doing it, well, let me put it a different way. I've never [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5510.16s)]
*  seen Ukrainians as happy as the morning they woke up and realized that there were strikes in Moscow [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5516.64s)]
*  for the first time, a barrage of strikes in Moscow for the first time. Like, people were smiling, [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5522.16s)]
*  they were grinning, they were saying, you know, we've been beaten up for more than a year, [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5527.12s)]
*  finally, we got to throw a jab back. And not even like a particularly, [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5532.16s)]
*  you know, as compared to what Russia has done to Ukrainian territory, not a particularly equal jab, [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5539.68s)]
*  but hey, at least we got a strike back. It was huge for Ukrainian morale. I mean, I remember [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5545.5199999999995s)]
*  that day very distinctly because of how many people were laughing, smiling, joking in a way that [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5554.16s)]
*  you don't expect people in a war zone to laugh, smile and joke. And so I would say, [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5558.72s)]
*  those attacks were not really done for huge strategic reasons. Probably on the strategic side, [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5566.240000000001s)]
*  it's a net negative. You know, you're alienating your biggest ally and going against their [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5571.68s)]
*  stated and explicit wishes. But on the morale front, it was huge. And on the information [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5578.0s)]
*  operations side, it was a signal from Ukraine to Russia. By the way, we can reach out and touch [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5585.52s)]
*  you too. Yeah. Well, look, Tim, where we'll I'm sure be coming back to you. Where should people [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5591.4400000000005s)]
*  follow you to just give give give our listeners a sense of like, what's your up to and where people [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5597.4400000000005s)]
*  can follow you as as we'll be checking in with you as well in the coming months. Yeah. So basically, [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5602.56s)]
*  I launched a new publication based in Kiev in Ukraine, focused on fighting Ukraine fatigue [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5607.68s)]
*  by doing compelling human interests and investigative stories. So we start all of our issues with a [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5615.12s)]
*  first person narrative from someone in the news. Basically, we think of the news as vegetables and [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5621.44s)]
*  like a compelling, a compelling human narrative and narrative journalism using the the the the [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5626.5599999999995s)]
*  tools of fictions and fiction and novels and applying it to nonfiction, using that storytelling [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5633.92s)]
*  method as a way to kind of wrap the vegetables around something a little meatier. And so we've [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5640.96s)]
*  launched this thing called the counter offensive and you can read it at counter offensive dot [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5647.52s)]
*  news. And it's a sub stack where we put out regular updates on the war through human lenses. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5651.28s)]
*  And we will always have a dog of war at the end of every single edition. So I hope your listeners [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5657.76s)]
*  will check it out and take a look at what we're doing. Great. Well, we appreciate it. Hope you [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5663.92s)]
*  stay safe and we'll look forward to being in touch here. Yeah. Thanks so much for having me. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5669.52s)]
*  Thanks again to Tim Mack for joining the show. Thanks again to Dr. Ronnie for lots of good times [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5674.400000000001s)]
*  and good luck. Reachy Soonak. Good luck with that pitch. Yeah. Well, thank you for sticking around [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5681.120000000001s)]
*  through all of our various rants and twists and turns. But it was a lot. There's a lot going on. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXpHbyAWFnM&t=5688.64s)]
