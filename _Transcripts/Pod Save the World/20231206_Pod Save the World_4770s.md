Video Description: Tommy Vietor and Ben Rhodes discuss the latest news from Gaza, including Israeli forces moving into southern Gaza, the Biden administration’s shift from a “hug Bibi” strategy to publicly criticizing Israel, and the ongoing skirmishes between the US military and Iranian proxy forces. They also talk about the latest controversies and accomplishments at the COP28 climate summit, how the UAE is fueling the civil war in Sudan, a US ambassador turned Cuban spy and the complicated, but mostly terrible, legacy of Henry Kissinger. Then Tommy interviews Vermont Senator Peter Welch about why he’s calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and what’s going on with Biden’s supplemental funding bill for Israel and Ukraine.

# Henry Kissinger Dies at 100, Leaving Behind a Polarizing Legacy of War
**Pod Save the World:** [December 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s)
*  Welcome back to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Ben Rhodes. Ben, did you hear that they found [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=0.0s)]
*  four gold bars or the four of the gold bars found at Bob Menendez's house have been directly linked to the guy accused of bribing him? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=6.0s)]
*  It's a weird coincidence, right? This is like, uh, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=13.6s)]
*  one of the most open and shut cases in the history of true crime, you know, uh, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=16.56s)]
*  we should do a crooked podcast like a true crooked true crime podcast on the Bob Menendez bus, but it's just two and a half minutes [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=21.12s)]
*  and we're like, uh, here's the deal a businessman named Fred Davies. Apparently this guy was there was an armed robbery [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=27.12s)]
*  this guy Fred Davies this businessman who allegedly, uh, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=33.52s)]
*  was doing these corrupt deals with Menendez and bribing him [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=36.88s)]
*  Davies got the gold bars stolen from him [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=40.400000000000006s)]
*  He had to register their serial numbers with the cops to get them back [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=42.64s)]
*  Which means there's a very clear chain of custody of these gold bars from this businessman Fred Davies to Bob Menendez's [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=46.24s)]
*  Like closet or whatever they were and he's still in the senate, right? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=55.12s)]
*  Still getting briefings foreign relations committee still getting briefings, you know [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=58.31999999999999s)]
*  Did you see john vetterman trolling him with the george santos cameo? Yeah [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=61.76s)]
*  It was uh, it was really well done. Well done, sir. You're on the road. You're in the uk now, but you [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=66.88s)]
*  I think yeah, i'm telling you though. I was in bratislava, uh [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=72.88s)]

*  I uh, so I can't sleep on the first nights of these europe trips and so I woke up at four in the morning and [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  I went out at 5 30 and just like [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=96.8s)]
*  Roam the streets of bratislava for like two and a half hours and I decided [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=99.36s)]
*  I'm gonna make an announcement today that I decided to become a travel writer [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=104.72s)]

*  It sounds that I just posted a bunch of pictures on instagram, but it was very nice [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  And then I spoke at a very good conference on democracy in bratislava [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=115.12s)]
*  So hats off to some of our obama foundation leaders who put that on so it was good [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=118.72s)]

*  I cannot wait to talk a little british politics. Uh, i'm sure a little [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=135.68s)]
*  World though content with them. So everybody should check out pod save the uk. I'm uh, i'm really looking forward to it. They're fun. They're funny [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=140.32s)]
*  I love that show. Yeah, they're funnier than us. I mean you're funny. Um, i'm a straight man [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=146.16s)]
*  So listen, but neither of us hold a candle to either of them, but we got a great show today [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=150.72s)]
*  We're going to cover the latest news from gaza [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=155.76000000000002s)]
*  A former top state department official who was arrested for spying for cuba. This is not bobby nanda [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=158.24s)]
*  Is another story the latest messy headlines and accomplishments out of the cop 28 climate summit the civil war in sudan [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=163.04s)]
*  And the life in times of all of our mentor henry kissinger [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=169.2s)]
*  And then after we record ben i'm going to talk with vermont senator peter welch about why he called for a ceasefire in gaza [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=173.76s)]
*  Uh the odds that biden supplemental funding bill for israel and ukraine passes and maybe tommy toberville whatever we got time for [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=180.48s)]
*  But i'm excited about that. Yeah, no people should read he put out a very long statement on the ceasefire, too [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=186.48s)]
*  Um, he's very thoughtful guy peter welch. So don't sleep on that guy. He's uh, he's got a lot to say [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=192.48s)]
*  I believe he's a holy cross grad like our own john febbro. Ah, I didn't know that [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=196.8s)]
*  Yeah, well, let's get that going for him. I was wiki and i'm earlier today [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=200.4s)]
*  Okay, let's uh start with the latest news from gaza [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=203.28s)]
*  So unfortunately since we last talked the fighting between israel and hamas has resumed resumed on friday [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=205.68s)]
*  Both sides blamed each other for the failure to extend the week-long ceasefire [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=211.44s)]
*  But it does seem clear that hamas was unwilling or unable to release all of the israeli women that they're currently holding hostage [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=214.96s)]
*  A lot of people are understandably quite concerned about how those women are being treated in captivity [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=221.44s)]
*  There have been some truly horrifying reports lately about sexual violence by hamas against israeli women on october 7th [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=226.48s)]
*  Including rape including uh mutilation just the worst things you could imagine a number of activists laid out the overwhelming evidence of those atrocities [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=233.12s)]
*  At the united nations on monday, um israeli forces have now moved into southern gaza. They started fighting in khan unis [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=241.2s)]
*  Southern gaza's largest city the head of israel's southern military command said quote [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=247.92s)]
*  We are in the most intense day since the beginning of the ground operation in terms of terrorists killed [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=252.56s)]
*  The number of firefights and the use of firepower from the land and air so things have not calmed down at all after the ceasefire [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=257.04s)]
*  Sounds like the opposite is true. Um after being told to evacuate [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=263.6s)]
*  You know from north to south gaza hundreds of thousands of civilians are now being told to evacuate again to go further south [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=267.76s)]
*  Maybe down to rafa which is right along the border with egypt and is already filled with thousands of displaced people in temporary shelters [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=273.91999999999996s)]
*  Um in then in terms of like sort of signals about when the fighting in gaza might end [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=280.56s)]
*  And then yahoo reportedly believes that killing hamas leader [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=285.52s)]
*  Uh, yaya sinwar might be enough to prove to the israeli public that israel had won the war [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=288.56s)]
*  Um, but that's just sort of one fragmentary report [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=293.76s)]
*  Longer term the wall street journal reported that israel's intelligence services are preparing to kill hamas leaders [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=296.71999999999997s)]
*  All around the world when the war winds down including in, uh, lebanon turkey qatar [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=302.48s)]
*  So something you know you and I talked about and predicted but sort of stark to see it in print [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=307.68s)]
*  um, there was also a pretty shocking times report that [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=312.64000000000004s)]
*  Israeli intelligence had attained the actual battle plan for the october 7th attack more than a year before it happened [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=316.8s)]
*  That it was widely circulated among israel's military and intelligence leaders [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=322.32000000000005s)]
*  But was basically dismissed this young sounds like a younger more junior female analyst was really trying to sound the alarm [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=326.32s)]
*  And was shut down, um by her senior commanders [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=332.72s)]
*  Um, so, you know ben meanwhile the the u.s messaging on gaza seems to have evolved [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=335.92s)]
*  Here are two clips that kind of tell that story. The first is vice president [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=340.88s)]
*  Kamala harris and the second is the secretary of defense loyd austin the united states is unequivocal [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=344.40000000000003s)]
*  international humanitarian law must be respected [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=349.74s)]
*  Too many innocent palestinians have been killed [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=353.84s)]
*  Frankly the scale of civilian suffering and the images and videos coming from gaza are devastating [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=357.59999999999997s)]
*  You see in this kind of a fight the center of gravity is the civilian population [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=364.23999999999995s)]
*  And if you drive them into the arms of the enemy you replace a tactical victory with a strategic defeat [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=369.44s)]
*  So I have repeatedly made clear to israel's leaders [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=376.08s)]
*  That protecting palestinian civilians in gaza is both a moral responsibility [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=379.92s)]
*  And a strategic imperative so two two very good points there ben, but I mean do you think that more critical [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=386.32s)]
*  Messaging out of these two means that the the u.s has abandoned the like hug bb strategy where we can't criticize it real in public [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=392.94s)]
*  It certainly feels that way tommy if you didn't read the accounts of the un meeting on the sexual violence [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=399.6s)]
*  If you needed a reminder of just the horrific nature of hamas and and what they did on october 7th, yeah [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=405.36s)]
*  Um, i'm glad that that was highlighted at that forum [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=411.76s)]
*  I do think though that the [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=416.88s)]
*  issue [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=418.96s)]
*  that has been clear in the last few days is [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=419.84s)]
*  I you know [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=422.96s)]
*  The the read out of that pause [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=424.88s)]
*  Uh was both the fact that I think the administration wanted to extend that pause as long as I could to get as many hostages [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=427.2s)]
*  That diplomatically but I also think they were hoping that if israel resumed its military operation [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=432.16s)]
*  That they would take on board a lot of this messaging definitely that has come from the administration that [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=437.36s)]
*  You need to change the nature of this military operation. It can't be as indiscriminate. There can't be as many civilian casualties [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=442.88000000000005s)]
*  It has to be more targeted and I think what we've seen in the last few days is [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=447.92s)]
*  The israeli government is not taking that on board and they're resuming bombardments of uh, civilians frankly [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=452.64000000000004s)]
*  And they're not moving to a more targeted way [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=461.2s)]
*  and look the hug bb there's been something kind of awkward about this from tommy for a couple weeks because [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=463.44s)]
*  the administration has been [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=469.52s)]
*  touting that they have this hug bb strategy while [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=471.52s)]
*  Increasingly saying on background and sometimes on the record that they don't like what israel's doing [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=474.7s)]
*  So i'm not sure, you know, I think they've already moved beyond it even if they haven't like formally announced it [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=478.88s)]
*  But I think it's the right approach and and look I think what loyd awson said [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=484.88s)]
*  Was incredibly important right right because he said that this could be a strategic defeat for israel, right? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=489.28000000000003s)]
*  And and that's a very powerful point and I think the thing that people should remember about loyd austin [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=496.40000000000003s)]
*  Is that he was the centcom commander? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=501.84000000000003s)]
*  um [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=504.64000000000004s)]
*  You know basically the commander of the united states forces in the middle east [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=505.84000000000003s)]
*  during a lot of urban warfare [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=509.36s)]
*  during efforts [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=511.68s)]
*  to go after isis for instance [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=513.0400000000001s)]
*  That were really tough fights in tough environments [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=516.0s)]
*  But were stretched out over longer periods of time [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=519.76s)]
*  um and and and did not have the same dynamics that we're seeing at play in gaza [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=523.04s)]
*  And and so, you know to hear that kind of warning from him [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=528.16s)]
*  um, I I think indicates just how concerned the administration is that [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=531.6s)]
*  International public opinion is just not going to tolerate this degree of civilian death [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=537.92s)]
*  Um that they're they're not getting through to the israelis because we know [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=542.5600000000001s)]
*  That loyd austin was consulting with the idf and with the israeli security forces and leadership [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=546.8000000000001s)]
*  About how to think about this military operation. So for him to come out and say that publicly [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=553.36s)]
*  Is an indication to me that he doesn't believe that they're they're taking on board that advice [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=557.76s)]
*  And this is happening at a time when the u.s is prepared to try to [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=563.12s)]
*  Pass a pretty massive aid package to support this military operation [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=566.8000000000001s)]
*  And so it certainly feels like there's a greater willingness to criticize. We haven't seen that from president biden yet [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=571.36s)]
*  But we're certainly seeing it from other parts of the administration and where it used to be kind of on background [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=577.9200000000001s)]
*  it used to be people saying, you know senior administration official says were [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=583.2s)]
*  Saying in private that they need to do more to prevent civilian deaths. Now you're starting to hear it publicly [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=587.44s)]
*  and and look there's big questions that remain like [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=593.2s)]
*  there's a public dispute a public difference about [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=596.48s)]
*  How gaza should be governed going forward whether the palestinians are in charge whether there's a multinational arab force [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=600.24s)]
*  Which is the kind of ideas that the u.s is supporting or whether israel has this kind of open-ended de facto occupation [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=605.44s)]
*  So there are already public [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=611.6800000000001s)]
*  Areas of daylight between the united states and israel in this thing. So we're kind of already past [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=613.84s)]
*  a hug bb strategy [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=619.76s)]
*  But we're not kind of fully in a place where the u.s is saying we don't agree with what is taking place [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=621.52s)]
*  But but I think that lord austin warning, you know speaks volumes [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=626.08s)]
*  Yeah, I want to ask senator welch about uh the u.s aid package to israel and whether it might get conditioned [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=629.6s)]
*  But you're right. I mean what we're talking about now is sort of like tactical disputes about how to avoid civilian casualties [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=634.88s)]
*  Those negotiations in disputes are are easy when compared to these long-term questions about who's going to run gaza [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=640.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean the u.s very clearly is planning for the palestinian authority to take on that role something that bb 9 [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=647.6s)]
*  Yahoo has shut down really hard in public. So god knows [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=652.96s)]
*  How how this will go going forward? Yeah, and I think the the the elephant in the room here is dan yahu, right? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=657.2s)]
*  um, and you know you brought up the the warning, um [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=663.6s)]
*  The intelligence support which was kind of crazy [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=667.76s)]
*  I I thought that'd be a bigger story in some ways tommy because it was kind of analogous to [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=670.32s)]
*  It coming out that the u.s before 9 11 [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=674.88s)]
*  Had a a blueprint for al-qaeda hijacking four airplanes from x airports [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=677.76s)]
*  And flying them into these targets. I mean it had the whole thing laid out. Yeah, um [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=684.32s)]
*  And and again, we don't know whether netanyahu says that he wasn't briefed on it, but but either way [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=689.44s)]
*  He's the prime minister [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=695.04s)]
*  He was on top of a system in which at the same time that he was distracted by his judicial coup [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=695.92s)]
*  And he was focused on the west bank [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=701.12s)]
*  Um that these warnings were getting ignored and his approval rating is like lower than it's ever been [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=703.2s)]
*  And so you have this hugely unpopular prime minister who has a track record of ignoring the united states [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=709.76s)]
*  Who's lost the confidence of his people and most of the people around the world frankly making these huge decisions? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=714.72s)]
*  About the future of this military operation the future of gaza [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=721.36s)]
*  Um, and and that to me is a pretty unstable place to be [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=724.5600000000001s)]
*  And to me the the point is that [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=729.12s)]
*  There really needs to be I think a new israeli leadership [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=731.6s)]
*  As soon as possible because if the idea is that we're going to wait until this is over well [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=734.64s)]
*  It may not be over for for months if not years, uh based on the messaging coming out of netanyahu [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=738.88s)]
*  So I I do think that there's a real issue to be uh dealt with here and look I mean [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=744.7199999999999s)]
*  Let's just pause on a moment of what's happening in southern gaza because you had a bunch of people [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=751.1999999999999s)]
*  Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people told to evacuate to the south now. They're being told to evacuate the south [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=755.6800000000001s)]
*  They have nowhere to go [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=760.8800000000001s)]
*  Because they can't leave gaza [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=762.48s)]
*  They're getting told to look at this grid system that israel created they put online [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=764.08s)]
*  You're supposed to go to like certain specific sectors like what if you can't get online if you can't power up your phone if you like [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=768.24s)]
*  None of this seems workable [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=774.8800000000001s)]
*  Yeah [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=776.08s)]
*  And I can't think of a similar situation where you add two million plus people kind of trapped in a condensed geographic area with no capacity [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=776.32s)]
*  To leave and just being told to move around while bombs are falling. I mean, it's a pretty dark [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=783.76s)]
*  A set of circumstances. Yeah, another couple of important pieces of the u.s policy debates here ben [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=789.52s)]
*  So politico reported that after hamas releases all the hostages the u.s [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=795.28s)]
*  Is considering whether or not to demand that cutter shut down hamas's political office in the country last week [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=800.0s)]
*  We went pretty deep on on the sort of unique and controversial role that cutter plays [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=806.2399999999999s)]
*  In diplomacy with hamas and other bad actors like the taliban but shutting down that office [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=811.04s)]
*  Um certainly raises the question of who the u.s or israel would talk to if there were to be another crisis [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=815.68s)]
*  And then the other really important update is that the u.s military continues to directly engage in fighting with these iranian-linked proxy forces [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=821.04s)]
*  In particular the hufii rebels in yemen over the weekend a u.s navy warship shot down three drones fired by the hufis [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=828.64s)]
*  Mostly they were fired at commercial vessels [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=836.64s)]
*  But there's some reporting suggests that one of the drones might have been targeting a u.s navy vessel itself [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=838.24s)]
*  It's not entirely clear, but the hufis say they're firing these, you know [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=842.64s)]
*  Ballistic missiles or drones to prevent israeli ships from trafficking in the red sea until there's a permanent ceasefire in gaza [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=846.88s)]
*  Iran is almost certainly supporting these attacks. Uh, and by the way, those attacks were absolutely not just aimed at israeli vessels [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=852.96s)]
*  They're they're screwing up all kinds of commerce and putting people at risk [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=859.36s)]
*  The u.s is reportedly considering [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=862.72s)]
*  Setting up some sort of like naval task force to counter that threat. It could be similar to the anti-piracy effort [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=865.0400000000001s)]
*  We've seen over the past few years [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=870.5600000000001s)]
*  Um around somalia, but these proxy attacks are also happening in iraq and syria [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=872.4s)]
*  So, you know ben you're seeing more and more calls from republicans, but also kind of like twitter warriors on social media [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=876.72s)]
*  Calling for the u.s to take stronger military action against the hufis or against iran directly and like all of it is a reminder that [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=884.96s)]
*  We are basically one failed missile defense system away from a u.s navy destroyer [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=892.5600000000001s)]
*  Getting hit a lot of people being killed a lot of service members being killed and all hell breaking loose [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=898.08s)]
*  And it just like it feels very very fraught and I do not think people realize how [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=902.88s)]
*  Close to the edge of an all-out war with iran. We are yeah because you've got you know, you've had attacks in syria [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=907.52s)]
*  You've had attacks in iraq. You've had attacks now on these vessels coming out of yemen [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=913.52s)]
*  You've had the u.s hit [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=918.8000000000001s)]
*  IRGC a rating revolutionary guard targets in syria already [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=920.4s)]
*  So these questions of regional escalation are already happening [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=925.36s)]
*  You know, uh, just because it's not like an all-out war between the u.s and iran doesn't mean that there's not been a pretty significant escalation [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=928.9599999999999s)]
*  Since october 7th and so long as this war goes on in gaza. I think those risks just continue to multiply [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=936.56s)]
*  look, I think it makes sense to have a task force that can [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=943.04s)]
*  Create better protection and security for vessels that are transiting that area and to make sure that [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=947.52s)]
*  The u.s has everything it needs to defend its own vessels [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=953.1199999999999s)]
*  But these ideas that the u.s should just start bombing these targets in yemen and other places [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=956.3199999999999s)]
*  It's a slippery slope. Uh, yeah [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=961.1999999999999s)]
*  We go to war with the houthis in yemen already a war-torn country already been devastated by [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=963.3599999999999s)]
*  a mistake by the u.s and supporting [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=969.76s)]
*  Uh the saudi-led intervention there and that began in the obama administration and we have to own that [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=972.5600000000001s)]
*  But but for the u.s to just start bombing countries in the middle east, uh [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=977.36s)]
*  This whole thing could get worse. Uh, and I think that's the danger [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=982.48s)]
*  Of this war going on. There's obviously the principal danger to civilians [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=986.5600000000001s)]

*  Axios reported that last week jared kushner donald trump's son-in-law former shadow secretary of state [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1221.9199999999998s)]
*  Hosted a meeting in new york city between the prime minister of cutter and a bunch of like billionaire business dudes [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1227.6799999999998s)]
*  A source in the room said that the prime minister answered questions about the hostage negotiations and cutter's relationship with hamas [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1234.6399999999999s)]
*  This was framed to axios as a meeting between jewish businessmen and the pm. I don't know some sort of attempt to bridge gaps [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1241.84s)]
*  But remember, you know this qatari company [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1248.3999999999999s)]
*  State-backed one, I assume cut jared kushner a 200 million dollar check for his little investment fund [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1251.68s)]
*  So clearly jared was using the war in gaza to show off his access do a little client management do a little client development [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1256.8s)]
*  So good stuff never never let a crisis go to waste jared. No and you know long history with [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1264.0s)]
*  Uh cutter investing in you know, 666 [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1269.3600000000001s)]
*  Right fifth avenue wherever the building was that jared had a real estate investment in building [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1272.4s)]
*  And look, you know one of the things i've noticed here tommy [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1276.96s)]
*  I mean just quick detour into american politics is that you know, i'm traveling across europe everybody here [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1278.8000000000002s)]
*  Is reading the same polls that we are in but they're more inclined to think that trump is going to win [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1285.0400000000002s)]
*  And i'm getting a little concerned about how that plays out in the middle east, you know [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1291.44s)]
*  Because if the saudis and the amirates and even the israeli government begins to think that trump is a likely [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1296.0800000000002s)]
*  Next president, I don't know how that shapes their actions, but I have a sense [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1303.92s)]
*  It's probably not going to shape their actions in a good way, you know [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1308.8s)]
*  And so that's another thing to watch here, too [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1312.72s)]
*  So this is this whole situation is getting more complicated. I do think you know, like the hamas office issue is the [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1314.48s)]
*  The question is you want to have some capacity [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1321.04s)]
*  I I totally understand the impulse behind it [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1324.88s)]
*  But at the same time as we talked about last week that we negotiated these hostage releases through cutter [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1326.88s)]
*  Um, and so long as there is such a thing as hamas, which I think no matter what happens in this military operation [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1332.0s)]
*  Um, there's likely going to continue to be some need to have a line of communication [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1338.48s)]
*  Um, and and I think just cutting that off [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1345.52s)]
*  Uh could create more problems. I mean, they'll go someplace else too. I mean they'll go to turkey [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1348.48s)]
*  Um, and so I don't know that you can totally shut this down [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1353.12s)]
*  But uh, yeah a lot a lot of moving parts of this thing and most of them are not moving in the right direction [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1355.52s)]
*  Yeah, I did see also that uh, vladimir putin is visiting saudi arabia and the uae [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1359.92s)]
*  Later this week on wednesday recording on tuesday. I guess he wants to talk about gaza global oil production ukraine [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1365.04s)]
*  But he also just hosted reisy president reisy veron in moscow [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1370.48s)]
*  So yeah a lot of folks there that could aspire to make our politics more complicated then [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1373.84s)]
*  Um, so we mentioned bob manendez at the top but here's a little more spy news for you guys [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1377.92s)]
*  On monday the department of justice charged the former u.s. Ambassador to bolivia with secretly working for cuba [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1382.4s)]
*  This complaint says was filed in miami. It says that 73 year old manuel rocha had been secretly working for cuba since 1981 [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1388.72s)]
*  And even though he's retired he had met with his handlers as recently as 2017 [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1396.4s)]
*  Uh, this guy served in a number of diplomatic posts during his career at the state department [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1401.68s)]
*  He was in the dominican republic condor es mexico argentina bolivia and at the u.s [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1406.0s)]
*  Interest section in havana cuba for a spell [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1410.4s)]
*  He also handled cuba policy at the national security council for a year between july of 94 [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1412.96s)]
*  Through july of 95 so in those roles, obviously you have access to a ton of sensitive and classified information about u.s. Policy towards cuba [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1418.48s)]
*  Um after retiring from the state department he worked as an advisor advisor to u.s southern command which obviously has cuba as part of it [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1425.68s)]
*  At some point pretty recently. So I think last year maybe [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1433.68s)]
*  The fbi got a tip about rocha so they had an undercover fbi agent posing as a cuban intelligence officer [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1436.72s)]
*  Sent him like a cold whatsapp message that said quote good afternoon ambassador [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1443.84s)]
*  My name is miguel. I have a message for you from your friends in havana. It is in regards to a sensitive matter. Are you available? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1447.84s)]
*  somehow this worked [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1454.08s)]
*  Uh rocha agreed to meet with miguel [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1456.24s)]
*  Uh, and in that meeting he talked in great detail about all the work he'd done for cuba over the past few decades [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1459.2s)]
*  Uh at later meetings he referred to the u.s as quote the enemy [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1465.92s)]
*  He got pissed off when he was asked whether he was still committed to the cause [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1469.6s)]
*  Um, so rocha is not the first u.s sort of senior u.s government employee charged with spying for cuba [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1474.3999999999999s)]
*  In 2001 the fbi arrested a woman named anna montez who had spent decades working as a top cuba analyst at the defense intelligence agency [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1480.32s)]
*  While also spying for cuba her motivation seems to have been purely ideological [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1488.1599999999999s)]
*  Um, it's not clear what rocha's motivation was yet [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1492.9599999999998s)]
*  But his rhetoric seems to suggest that he had some ideological motivation as well [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1496.56s)]
*  Uh attorney general mary garland called this quote one of the highest reaching and longest standing infiltrations of the u.s government by a foreign agent [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1502.3200000000002s)]
*  Wow, uh ben so to steal a cliche from our old boss [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1510.5600000000002s)]
*  Cuban intelligence really punching above their weight there, huh? [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1513.8400000000001s)]
*  pretty impressive [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1516.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1517.76s)]
*  Well, look, I mean there's a long history of cuban intelligence, uh being quite active in the united states. Um, you know when I was uh, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1518.64s)]
*  Negotiating with the cuban government directly [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1527.5s)]
*  Um, you know, we were certainly made aware, uh that that they were quite aggressive, uh in some of their tactics [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1530.24s)]
*  Uh, they certainly tried every way they could I think to you know, entrap people let's just say in different ways [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1537.2s)]
*  Um, including when certainly when they were in in cuba, but yeah, like I mean it just speaks to the fact that um [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1544.48s)]
*  You know, this is an entrepreneurial intelligence service [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1552.08s)]
*  uh that [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1555.6s)]
*  Pretty aggressively tries to to penetrate, you know [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1557.68s)]
*  The u.s government but also, you know, there's a history of them trying to penetrate, you know other u.s institutions in and miami and academics [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1561.28s)]
*  The other thing that I remember too tommy is that they would try to penetrate [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1569.44s)]
*  um the kind of democracy community, right the people that uh, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1573.04s)]
*  You know receive even u.s government funding to promote democracy. So, you know the thing about the cuban intelligence service is [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1577.6000000000001s)]
*  They punch above their weight in part because the u.s is like an overwhelming focus of theirs, you know [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1584.96s)]
*  They're not they're they're you know, they do stuff in other places. They certainly do stuff across latin america [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1589.28s)]
*  But unlike us, you know, they're they're not looking uh that much at you know, china and russia and all these other places [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1594.0s)]
*  And so there's been this kind of battle for decades [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1599.04s)]
*  Um, but this is a you know, this is a pretty significant get for them [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1601.84s)]
*  If this guy was an ambassador in all these places and if he was at the white house at the national security council like [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1605.12s)]
*  The guy had access to everything, you know, yeah, i'm sure it didn't help. Uh, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1610.0s)]
*  The u.s interests here that we were so thirsty and concerned about cuba for so long and so eager [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1614.16s)]
*  To fuck with their politics in every way possible that they could throw some double agent at whatever like idiotic [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1620.16s)]
*  Uh working group the dullest brothers had set up in miami to try to take down castro and very easily [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1626.64s)]
*  You know get us to uh to get ourselves in trouble [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1632.16s)]
*  Yeah, you know there's a kind of absurdity about the tit for tat [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1634.88s)]
*  But you know because like let's bear in mind and you can go back and read the church committee [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1638.88s)]
*  I mean the cia's track record in cuba is really really aggressive embarrassing [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1642.88s)]
*  and so there's a bit of a sense I think from the cubans that you know, we're [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1648.24s)]
*  uh, you know, we're still locked in this kind of the tit for tat with you guys, but um, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1652.0s)]
*  I will say this tommy like uh [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1657.8400000000001s)]
*  I often wonder like who has better encryption whatsapp or signal, you know [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1660.3200000000002s)]
*  If i'm like talking to someone and you know, you don't want it to be shared with [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1663.68s)]
*  Multiple of the governments that we criticize on this podcast [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1668.3200000000002s)]
*  Um, it's a different issue if someone's like hello [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1671.5200000000002s)]
*  My name is miguel like hello. I am your handler [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1674.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1677.68s)]
*  Hello comrade like some number you've never heard from before and it's just like hey [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1678.16s)]
*  Could you come please lay out for me the degree to which you've been a double agent? [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1682.72s)]
*  I mean, it's up there with menendez, you know in terms of just the gold bars brazenness of what these guys are doing [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1686.48s)]
*  It makes you wonder by the way [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1691.2800000000002s)]
*  Both of these things because menendez is basically spying for egypt, right? [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1693.2800000000002s)]
*  um [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1696.72s)]
*  Are there more of these? You know, like yeah [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1697.5200000000002s)]
*  It's you know, it makes you a little nervous that maybe uh the penetration of the u.s [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1699.68s)]
*  Government's a little more wide reaching than we think because you know, these are the ones we're catching [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1703.6s)]
*  It suggests that there there may be from multiple governments other people up to no good. Yeah [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1707.2s)]
*  No, my takeaway was wow these guys had high level access to senior state department employees for [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1711.84s)]
*  40 years that's amazing [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1717.36s)]
*  But also this guy appears to be a moron if he was caught with like a cold call like whatsapp message. That's um, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1718.8799999999999s)]
*  Not great. It tells you makes you wonder what a a really smart savvy [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1724.8799999999999s)]
*  Ops sec conscious agent could do exactly exactly. Yeah, um ben [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1729.28s)]
*  So let's let's turn uh to the cop 28 un climate summit in dubai because uh, it continues to not go so great [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1733.76s)]
*  Um last week we talked about reports that the uae was using the cop meeting [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1740.96s)]
*  They're hosting the cop meeting the united air member. It says to line up more oil and gas deals [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1745.68s)]
*  That's obviously not great if you're trying to deal with climate change then on sunday the guardian reported that the president of cop 28 [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1750.08s)]
*  Sultan al-jaber who runs the uae state oil company said that there is no science indicating that a phase out of fossil fuels [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1757.12s)]
*  It's what's going to achieve the world's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees celsius and that doing so would quote [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1764.72s)]
*  Take the world back into caves. Uh, here's a clip of uh al-jaber going off on this [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1771.2s)]
*  I'm not in any way signing up to any discussion that is alarmist. I am here factual and I respect the science and there is no [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1776.72s)]
*  Science out there or no scenario out there that says that the phase out of fossil fuel is what's going to achieve [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1783.44s)]
*  1.5. I I read that your company is is investing in a lot more fossil fuel in the future [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1791.2s)]
*  Yes, ma'am. You're reading you're reading your own media, which is biased and wronged [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1796.8s)]
*  I am telling you I am the man in charge and it is wrong help me show me a road map [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1801.04s)]
*  For a phase of the fossil fuel that will allow [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1806.96s)]
*  That will allow for socio for sustainable socio-economic development unless you want to take the world back into caves [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1809.52s)]
*  Show me. Yeah, I think we can we have we have [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1818.0s)]
*  Give me the solution you talk about having women be involved [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1823.8400000000001s)]
*  We in this small country have included women more than any other country in the world [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1827.6000000000001s)]
*  I don't think mary will be able to help solve the climate problem by pointing fingers or contributing [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1832.72s)]
*  To the polarization and the divide that is already [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1839.52s)]
*  Happening in the world what we need here is solutions [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1842.64s)]
*  Show me the solutions. Uh, so ben this wasn't some surreptitious recording [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1846.56s)]
*  This was a live online event hosted by mary robinson the former president of ireland and un special envoy for climate change [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1850.16s)]
*  The guardian obtained the audio [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1856.08s)]
*  Uh, sir, by the way, yeah, if you're asking for solutions [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1858.3999999999999s)]
*  you're supposed to be running the the event where you find them, but former vice president al gore told the new york times that [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1861.36s)]
*  Uh jabera leading the cop was the quote the most brazen conflict of interest in the history of climate negotiations [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1868.0s)]
*  He was not happy about this audio coming out also at the summit [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1873.1999999999998s)]
*  The u.s announced a plan to cut methane emissions by nearly 80 percent by 2038 [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1876.24s)]
*  That is quite important because methane can trap 80 times as much heat as carbon dioxide into our atmosphere [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1880.56s)]
*  But it only lingers in the atmosphere for about a decade [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1886.16s)]
*  So if we can drastically cut methane now, it will pay big dividends in the relatively near future [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1888.72s)]
*  Vice president kamala harris announced another three billion commitment from the u.s [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1894.0s)]
*  To climate change a bunch of countries pledged to triple renewable energy production by 2030 [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1898.48s)]
*  Um, there's lots of announcements and et cetera, but I know ben given all these terrible headlines [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1903.52s)]
*  given all the cynicism going in given that I think there was [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1908.72s)]
*  Uh, four times as many, you know fossil fuel reps at cop 28 as there were anybody else [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1912.0s)]
*  What do you think the report card is so far on on cop 28? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1917.6s)]
*  You know, let's just say like we're not like passing with flying colors here [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1921.36s)]
*  But is anybody surprised? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1925.1999999999998s)]
*  I mean from the very beginning when they announced that they're going to do this thing in the yoey and [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1926.56s)]
*  It's going to be chaired by the guy who runs the fossil fuel company there [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1930.48s)]
*  I mean, it's a bit like having the you know summit on uh pandemic preparedness in like a wet market in wuhan china in [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1933.84s)]
*  2020 or something, you know, it's just like like of course fossil fuels are a problem. Um, my hope is [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1941.6s)]
*  that [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1948.24s)]
*  look, I mean [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1949.04s)]
*  Welcome any progress that comes out of this funding for renewables funding for the loss and damages fund as we've talked about [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1950.48s)]
*  This methane piece is important, but I do think that there's been this drift that we've talked about towards [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1956.8799999999999s)]
*  basically this kind of co-opting of cop, uh [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1963.6799999999998s)]
*  By the fossil fuel industry where suddenly you've got like more lobbyists from fossil fuel companies than the delegations of most governments [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1967.0400000000002s)]
*  I hope that there's a way for the next one to really [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1974.4s)]
*  Turn that around, you know, like this is becoming speak. Look, it's becoming a joke. It's becoming like totally cynical [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1978.3200000000002s)]
*  It's why people don't trust these processes [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1984.88s)]
*  Sure, I understand there has to be some degree of dialogue with these companies [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1987.8400000000001s)]
*  But let's be clear here like you can't deal with climate change if you don't phase out fossil fuels full stop [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1991.8400000000001s)]
*  I mean and that's obvious. I don't think you need to be like a a climate scientist to understand that, you know [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=1996.8s)]
*  Like it's pretty basic, you know [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2002.3200000000002s)]
*  And we can talk about how long that's going to take and we talk about the timeline for transition and [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2003.92s)]
*  And this guy obviously has like multiple interests and one of which is to sustain the profit that is being generated in the enormous revenue [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2008.56s)]
*  I mean look part of the awkward point is that the reason why [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2015.8400000000001s)]
*  The emirates are so cash rich right now [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2018.96s)]
*  And the reason why you know people like mary robbins are going down there at panel discussions is because they're making money off of fossil fuels [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2020.96s)]
*  right, right, um, and and and and so I think there really has to be a way to say like [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2027.04s)]
*  Time out here. We're going to take a look at who's attending this conference [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2032.24s)]
*  We're going to try to make sure that the balance shifts back towards government negotiators [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2035.52s)]
*  activists NGOs [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2040.22s)]
*  Businesses that are sincerely trying to hit certain targets. I think there needs to be like an accountability measure [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2042.4s)]
*  For the private sector as well as governments, you know, like they review what governments are doing [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2048.48s)]
*  Sometimes private sector shows up and they make commitments and then nobody really knows that they're falling through on that [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2052.8s)]
*  I just think they need to look at the architecture of these summits to make sure that this kind of thing doesn't keep happening [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2057.6s)]
*  Because it's hard to look at this and not think that like this whole process [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2064.08s)]
*  Is is like the the un is losing control of it. Yeah, it breeds cynicism. Uh speaking of not taking things seriously enough [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2069.36s)]
*  Uh faber just sent around a tweet to crooked slack [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2075.68s)]
*  That includes a screen capture from the five like I think the the most watched show on fox news [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2079.44s)]
*  Here's the chiron. It's a photo of john carrey and it says greenhouse gas question mark [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2084.7999999999997s)]
*  John carrey accused of breaking wind at climate speech. So that's how fox is is covering cop 28 [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2089.04s)]
*  Makes you think [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2094.96s)]
*  Speaking of methane capture, um [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2096.64s)]
*  Put that one in a time capsule something wonderful wonderful. Yeah, I know your kids will be proud of you everyone who worked on that show [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2099.8399999999997s)]
*  Uh, okay switching gears here. So ben actually this is this is uae related [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2105.2000000000003s)]
*  So we've talked about how there's been a civil war raging in sudan for about seven months now sudan's armed forces [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2109.36s)]
*  Are fighting against a paramilitary force in sudan called the rsf the two generals who lead these two forces were allies [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2116.4s)]
*  But they had a falling out that spiraled into this all-out war [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2123.36s)]
*  They basically they came together to uh to overturn civilian governments and then once that happened they you know split apart [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2126.0s)]
*  No surprise there. So the the fighting for this civil war started in the capital city of kartum [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2132.08s)]
*  It quickly spread throughout the country including into the dar four region where i'm sure a lot of listeners [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2136.24s)]
*  Remember there was a genocide about 20 years ago [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2141.6s)]
*  The militia groups that conducted that previous genocide were called the janja weed and the janja weed over time evolved into the rsf [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2144.7999999999997s)]
*  This paramilitary group the un says that the fighting has killed up to 9 000 people displaced over 6 million people and left [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2151.44s)]
*  25 million people so that's more than half the country's population in need of humanitarian aid [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2158.56s)]
*  So it is as dire as dire gets 70 to 80 percent of hospitals in conflict areas are not operational anymore [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2163.12s)]
*  And the un is expressing widespread concern over about sexual violence committed by the rsf against women across sudan systemic rape [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2169.04s)]
*  Last week the un security council voted to pull its staff out of sudan [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2178.2400000000002s)]
*  So you're seeing the international community leaving the stage or at least setting a timetable to leave the stage rather than getting more [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2182.16s)]
*  Engaged and other diplomatic effort to brook or pcl have failed but one of the key drivers [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2187.2000000000003s)]
*  Of this conflict have been weapon shipments to the rsf by the uae [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2193.52s)]
*  There's lots of reporting about this the uae denies it but they basically set up this base in eastern chad [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2199.44s)]
*  They claim they're using it to funnel in humanitarian relief, but it's clear that they've been setting in weapons [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2205.12s)]
*  The rsf also has ties with the wagner group [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2210.96s)]
*  And so ben, you know [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2214.56s)]
*  I know that [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2215.7599999999998s)]
*  The world was very busy trying to get everyone to focus on climate change at cop 28 in dubai [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2216.96s)]
*  But have you seen any evidence that the u.s? [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2222.24s)]
*  Or other countries are putting pressure on the uae to stop sending in these weapons shipments to sudan because boy [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2225.12s)]
*  Does that seem like it would be an easy way to slow down the violence? [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2231.2s)]
*  I haven't and you know, there's just a ton of reporting on this. This is not like rumors [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2234.7999999999997s)]
*  This is stuff that like has been pretty well established [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2239.12s)]
*  And look, it's a just a horrifying situation in sudan [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2242.3199999999997s)]
*  and you know [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2246.3999999999996s)]
*  genocidal violence in darfur again [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2247.7599999999998s)]
*  And no horizon for some kind of political settlement these two warlords essentially locked in this death battle [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2250.8799999999997s)]
*  How can you affect that? [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2258.64s)]
*  The first way is to try to turn off the spigot [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2261.2799999999997s)]
*  Of the weapons that are getting in there from wherever they're coming from and clearly with the rsf that includes the uae [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2264.72s)]
*  So like i'm not suggesting that would make the civil war end [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2271.12s)]
*  But it would certainly potentially slow things down and start to try to create some different incentives for these guys [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2274.64s)]
*  Because the more they have like an open spigot of weapons the more the incentive is to just kind of keep ratcheting up the violence [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2279.52s)]
*  um, then I think there's regional implications to tommy like [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2285.4399999999996s)]
*  Chad which borders sudan [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2289.7599999999998s)]
*  Is the last you know, there's a risk of we could have another coup there, you know [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2292.16s)]
*  It's it's right in and the coup belt there it'd be the last domino to fall but to sudan [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2296.0s)]
*  And suddenly you've just got like a whole string of countries that have been taken over by coups [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2301.28s)]
*  You've got the wagner group like, you know [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2304.88s)]
*  Involved to some extent in these places and russia involved to some extent [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2307.44s)]
*  So, you know you need some effort to try to begin to get this back in a political process to try to get [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2311.2000000000003s)]
*  You know ceasefires at least in some areas like we saw in the fighting in ethiopia [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2318.0s)]
*  If you can at least stop the fighting in some places you can get humanitarian aid in there again [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2322.32s)]
*  Um and and some diplomatic process and there's been a curious kind of washing of the hands on this thing like the african union [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2326.48s)]
*  Which is the main organization that's supposed to settle these types of issues or address these types of issues in africa [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2333.36s)]
*  It's kind of taking this position now of like these are internal affairs. We don't meddle in internal affairs [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2338.6400000000003s)]
*  This is this is a humanitarian catastrophe [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2343.1200000000003s)]
*  And it's also one that could you know continue to destabilize the region [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2345.92s)]
*  And so yeah, yes to to circle back to where we began the obvious place to start is [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2350.0s)]
*  Going to countries like the ue and saying time to stop arming people that are committing atrocities. Yeah, it's like I I think people sometimes wonder [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2355.2s)]
*  why are [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2363.7599999999998s)]
*  folks like us activists in the u.s. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2365.52s)]
*  So hard on israel [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2368.0s)]
*  Uh in the conduct of the war in gaza and it's in part because we think they'll listen and because the u.s [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2369.84s)]
*  Has leverage I would argue that this is another such instance like I know that the uae's ambassador [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2374.56s)]
*  To the u.s throws great parties at cafe milano all the time [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2380.4s)]
*  But this is not the first conflict that the ua has been fucking around in in africa [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2383.68s)]
*  They armed a warlord named iftar in libya [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2387.6s)]
*  They provided drones to ethiopia that were used in their civil war where hundreds thousands of people were killed [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2390.16s)]
*  There we know we got about 5 000 u.s. Troops stationed at the uae and remember the trump administration [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2396.0s)]
*  Uh agreed to sell all kinds of advanced weapons to the ua as part of the abraham accords [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2401.14s)]
*  So stuff we're giving them could be feeding these conflicts all over the globe [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2406.42s)]
*  But it's just like time to rethink this time for a little more public pressure [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2410.58s)]
*  And I I hope a little more behind the scenes pressure from the from the biden folks or at least maybe we'll get readouts of what's [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2414.1s)]
*  Happening. Yeah, no, you could add yemen to that list too, obviously because they were part of the saudi [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2419.54s)]
*  invasion there [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2424.66s)]
*  And what's part of what's kind of curious to me about a tommy too is it's it's unnecessary like the ua has [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2426.98s)]
*  Tons of money. They're doing pretty well. Like they're this kind of regional hub for finance [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2432.34s)]
*  Um, why do they have to do this? You know, right like they they they have the side of you know, that's invested [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2437.38s)]
*  You know, they want to invest in ai and they want to invest in in science and technology. They've got a space program [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2442.7400000000002s)]
*  They've got all this influence like it seems unnecessary like [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2448.26s)]
*  For the I mean sure maybe they get marginal interests advanced maybe they're getting natural resources, right? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2452.34s)]
*  Maybe they're getting access to things but like I think they'll be okay [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2457.38s)]
*  By stopping this and I do think you're right. The u.s can be you know a voice on this stuff [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2461.2200000000003s)]
*  I mean the concern is always that well, then they'll get closer to the russians [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2466.26s)]
*  Well, they they play that game anyway [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2469.38s)]
*  And as you said like putin's going down to the region anyway [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2470.98s)]
*  Like the the u.s is still the main security guarantor for the ue the u.s is still going to be important to them [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2472.9s)]
*  I think we can have harder conversations about some of these things and I think the ue will be fine if [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2479.06s)]
*  If they turn off some of this stuff [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2484.02s)]
*  Yeah, there's some reports that maybe they're getting access to like gold mines or something. But yeah again, I mean, this is crass [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2485.86s)]
*  There's enough money. They've got there. You're doing fine guys. Yeah, it's yeah gold coming out of the ground in the form of liquid gas [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2490.42s)]
*  So, uh ben you mentioned the coup belt that got me thinking of henry kissinger, uh, who died last week at the age of 100 [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2495.6200000000003s)]
*  Um, so a little bio in kissinger [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2502.82s)]
*  Then I'd love to get your thoughts because you wrote a great piece for the new york times that everyone should read [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2504.6600000000003s)]
*  So kissinger was born in germany. His family barely escaped the nazis in 1938 [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2508.8199999999997s)]
*  So I read one of the many recent pieces about him then since he passed away [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2513.06s)]
*  And I didn't realize I think his family got out like three months before crystal knocked [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2517.06s)]
*  And then nearly all the jews in the town he grew up and were killed went from like 2000 to 40 people by the end [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2521.62s)]
*  Um, he served in the u.s army during world war two [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2526.66s)]
*  Later worked as a faculty member at harvard university and then kissinger becomes richard nixon's national security advisor in 1969 [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2529.06s)]
*  He was appointed secretary of state in 1973 [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2535.2999999999997s)]
*  He kept both titles at once for a period of time [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2537.94s)]
*  Which is just insane if you know much work goes into both those jobs [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2540.1s)]
*  And then after nixon resigns in disgrace after watergate kissinger keeps working for jerald ford [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2543.2999999999997s)]
*  And you know, he becomes a sort of like iconic figure who is the front page of the tabloids the front page of the political section [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2548.5s)]
*  The international section he was like, you know omnipresent in u.s culture for decades [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2554.3399999999997s)]
*  so [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2558.3399999999997s)]
*  On sort of the positive side of the ledger kissinger is often credited with easing tensions with the soviet union during the cold war [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2559.14s)]
*  In particular arms control agreements the salt arms control treaty. Uh, he was leading secret talks in normalized relations with china [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2565.54s)]
*  And he conducted a bunch of shuttle diplomacy in the middle east after the yom kippur war [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2573.1400000000003s)]
*  And he negotiated the end to the u.s involvement in the vietnam war, but there's some very big caveats there [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2576.82s)]
*  So again the kissinger [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2582.98s)]
*  Somehow got the 1973 Nobel peace prize for getting the u.s out of vietnam [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2584.98s)]
*  But he also helped extend the war for five years by feeding information to nixon's campaign [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2589.54s)]
*  Uh that they used to sabotage lbj's peace talks right before the 1968 election [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2594.02s)]
*  Oh, and by the way that 1973 peace deal quickly collapsed if you were a vietnamese person kissinger gets lots of credit for negotiating arms control agreements [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2598.58s)]
*  But he was also an early proponent of the use of tactical nuclear weapons [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2606.1s)]
*  And the feasibility of limited nuclear war so he was kind of solving a problem [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2610.2599999999998s)]
*  He helped create there and then finally like kissinger helped broker nixon's opening with china and led, you know [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2614.58s)]
*  That first secret trip to china, but he did it through the president of pakistan in exchange the u.s [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2620.34s)]
*  Actively supported pakistan's genocidal war in what is now called bangladesh [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2626.98s)]
*  Which killed hundreds of thousands of people and pushed 10 million people into india as refugees [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2632.26s)]
*  So ben i'll pause there because I know you have lots of thoughts on this man [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2637.6200000000003s)]
*  But you know the more and more I consume about him in his like these obits and his legacy [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2641.46s)]
*  It seems to me like the best way to summarize him is a brilliant guy who seemed to only care about himself his access to power [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2648.1800000000003s)]
*  Preserving that access to power. It's it's sort of hard to find a real ideology or moral compass or frankly like any concern [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2656.1s)]
*  about [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2663.54s)]
*  People or the lives that he impacted so I don't know over to you because I know you in particular [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2664.7400000000002s)]
*  Um were writing about cambodia and what he did to vietnam [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2669.94s)]
*  Yeah, I I wrote this piece of the times that people can check out and and and the the basic [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2674.1s)]
*  Thesis of it right is kissinger more than anybody else represents this aspect of american national security policy [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2679.3s)]
*  That that makes us hypocrites that that shows the gap between the story [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2684.9s)]
*  We tell about ourselves in the world is standing up for these values and then the ways in which we act in this completely [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2689.06s)]
*  self-interested way that is often [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2694.32s)]
*  Totally divorced from any set of values [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2696.34s)]
*  Um, and in that way he was kind of the perfect avatar of the american national security state that has grown since world war two [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2698.6600000000003s)]
*  And if you look at that ledger tommy, I think there's some important things to note [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2705.3s)]
*  Like the vietnam war that he extended he expanded it. He was like the principal architect of expanding that into laos and cambodia [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2708.98s)]
*  Dropping more bombs on laos in any country than germany and japan during world war two personally picking targets [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2717.1400000000003s)]
*  From his office in the west wing [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2723.38s)]
*  Yeah, and in a secret war that we didn't even declare publicly and destabilizing cambodia in ways that led to decades [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2724.8199999999997s)]
*  Of violence and suffering there as well [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2731.7s)]
*  And and what we got for that was was no better the the terms [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2734.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean we lost the war and and and so it's not like that achieved anything [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2738.34s)]
*  It was like he was trying to send this message about credibility the credibility like we're going to show you that [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2742.2599999999998s)]
*  You know if we're going to lose a war we're going to make it really hard on the people that beat us essentially [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2747.14s)]
*  Was kind of the mentality that it seemed to be guiding him [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2751.22s)]
*  That if you look at the support for the genocidal violence that you mentioned in east pakistan now bangladesh [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2754.74s)]
*  Support for similar genocidal violence in indonesia support for a military coup in chile [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2761.3799999999997s)]
*  He's thought thought of as a strategist of the cold war but none of those things [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2768.3399999999997s)]
*  Like contributed to the victory in the cold war, you know, it's not like [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2772.9799999999996s)]
*  Well because we supported the indonesian government just like crushing people in east timor that somehow that that's why we won the cold war [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2777.22s)]
*  Right, like there's these rationalizations that people use for why we have to do even chile, right? [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2784.58s)]
*  If salvador allende a socialist state in charge of chile, it's where the soviet union have won the cold war [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2789.22s)]
*  You know, we we talk ourselves into these things [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2794.5s)]
*  and so there's [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2797.62s)]
*  and look the u.s does [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2798.8199999999997s)]
*  Complicated and sometimes bad shit around the world a lot [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2800.8799999999997s)]
*  I think kissinger is just a different scale if you look at the violence in southeast asia the violence in these other places [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2804.02s)]
*  Now to his credit as you said his diplomacy with the soviet union with china that did contribute [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2809.7799999999997s)]
*  To the end of the cold war certainly the opening to china did and slowing down the arms race of the soviet union certainly was a positive [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2816.58s)]
*  Thing right the china thing is a little complicated though because look what happened to china, right? [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2822.9s)]
*  It became more autocratic more authoritarian now. They're our biggest geopolitical adversary [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2826.18s)]
*  So look he brilliant guy and you know, like he's looking at different pieces and he's but but the outcomes matter here [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2830.98s)]
*  And the outcomes matter for people and when he when he is fed and embraced by the american establishment the way [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2837.7s)]
*  He has been for decades including after he passed away [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2843.54s)]
*  The message the rest of the world takes away from that is it like [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2846.82s)]
*  Americans don't care about us americans don't see our lives as of equal value because they don't seem to have a problem [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2850.02s)]
*  With what this guy was doing in these places [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2855.94s)]
*  and and and that's I you know [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2859.7799999999997s)]
*  Like the point I made in the article was like credibility isn't like showing how much will like hurt someone [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2862.1s)]
*  Who does something we don't like credibility is are we who we say we are? [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2867.22s)]
*  um, and and and so look i'm [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2870.82s)]
*  You know, I was a little hard on the guy [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2872.98s)]
*  But like I mean he was pretty hard on a lot of people around the world. Um, [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2874.18s)]
*  I I recognize that he was a you know, a brilliant guy who had consequential achievements like the opening in china [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2878.34s)]
*  That's part of the legacy too and and I think I support the idea that we should be engaged with diplomacy with adversaries as kissinger was [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2884.98s)]
*  but [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2893.2200000000003s)]
*  Is it worth all the rest of it? [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2894.1800000000003s)]
*  And the last thing I say to Tommy is that like he he was constantly kind of held up as this oracle and this brilliant guy [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2895.6200000000003s)]
*  and look [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2902.1800000000003s)]
*  I don't know if you heard him talk in recent years like he didn't say anything that interesting [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2903.2200000000003s)]
*  No, this was like yeah, I'm like come on. Yeah [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2907.54s)]
*  It's kind of banal statements the world is very complicated right now and we therefore [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2910.1s)]
*  like I actually like challenged people like some of the stuff he wrote he wrote some historical books about diplomas that are kind of [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2914.42s)]
*  interesting but like [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2919.14s)]
*  He kind of became famous for being famous and and it was kind of like he was powerful because people thought he was powerful [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2920.74s)]
*  That's exactly right. He had access to people so he'd fly to china and meet with jie jian ping [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2927.22s)]
*  And so then therefore people wanted to meet with him and hear [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2931.38s)]
*  You know anything he said because he seemed like he had this kind of smell of power around him and [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2933.7799999999997s)]
*  And I think the way [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2938.5s)]
*  Some of this isn't even his fault the way in which he was embraced by the american establishment [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2939.94s)]
*  Says a lot more about the american establishment than it does about henry kissinger at the end of the day [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2943.7799999999997s)]
*  Because all he was doing is like running the same play for the last 50 years. Totally. Yeah [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2947.54s)]
*  I know he would he would go meet with jie jian ping come back to the u.s [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2951.62s)]
*  Type up a 16 page single space report send it to anyone who would listen and be like, oh my god [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2954.66s)]
*  What an important thing. Yeah, I mean the guy [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2959.22s)]
*  Look a few things. He was not an elected [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2961.7799999999997s)]
*  leader he had no popular mandate like he he was [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2964.5s)]
*  He was nixon's buddy in his darkest drunkest final years [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2968.1s)]
*  And he would like take his calls and and wiretap his colleagues to see we'd find who was leaking and rat [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2972.8199999999997s)]
*  Fuck the guy around the corner. You know, I mean like this was not an honorable [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2979.2999999999997s)]
*  Period of service but also people admired that about him [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2984.42s)]
*  That's what i'm saying. It's like people are like wow like that guy really knew how to run the machinery of the bureaucracy [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2987.62s)]
*  I know I know [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2991.22s)]
*  But like his his ability to play the game in towering self-regard is probably like the most notable thing [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2992.9s)]
*  I mean david sanger wrote his new york times obituary david sanger is a reporter we've known for a very long time [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=2999.38s)]
*  Sanger wrote how? [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3007.86s)]
*  Kissinger had a series of conversations with him over the course of seven years about this obituary [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3009.94s)]
*  And sanger was working off a previous draft written by another journalist who died in 2010, right? [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3016.34s)]
*  By the way kissinger as david writes in his in his obit wrote [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3022.66s)]
*  3,800 pages worth of memoirs [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3027.2000000000003s)]
*  Again, this guy wasn't the president of the united states. He worked for a couple of them [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3030.1s)]
*  You know, it's just like for for two terms for eight years [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3033.94s)]
*  Like I was in the u.s government as long as henry kissinger was you know, I mean just yeah, and you didn't do as many coups [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3036.5s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. No, no, no, you know, it's uh, and my mess my memoir didn't clock in that long, but that's probably too long [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3041.86s)]
*  yeah, anyway, I would like not like not a look i'm not a [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3047.62s)]
*  Dance on people's graves guy. I do think you're the the points you made in your piece and the point [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3051.62s)]
*  We're trying to make here on [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3056.2599999999998s)]
*  The show is that like just being in power or having power isn't honorable or admirable [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3058.2599999999998s)]
*  It's what you do with it and just using it [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3064.5s)]
*  Yeah people admire and i'd say that because some people are like, oh you shouldn't have done that [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3066.66s)]
*  I but like first of all, I tried to kind of give a balanced view [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3070.4199999999996s)]
*  But also like the guy lived a hundred years [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3072.74s)]
*  And he was burnishing his legacy for the last several decades [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3075.62s)]
*  Yeah, he's just fine. And so the idea that none of us can say anything critical for a while [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3078.66s)]
*  Well, that's when the legacy is established [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3083.06s)]
*  And I think a lot of people around the world want to hear that americans understand [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3085.14s)]
*  That this is a complicated guy who did a lot of bad stuff as well as doing achieving some stuff and [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3089.46s)]
*  And so I I think it's a mistake to say like we just have to celebrate somebody like this [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3094.3399999999997s)]
*  Uh, no like the the people in laos didn't get that opportunity, you know [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3099.14s)]
*  Like the the kids in laos didn't even get an opportunity to grow up [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3103.22s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, and so it's just so weird that someone who saw [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3107.2999999999997s)]
*  such evil [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3110.18s)]
*  Growing up in nazi germany barely escaped like the horrors of the holocaust would then just have so little regard for [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3111.46s)]
*  Human beings around the globe. It's just I don't know you'd you would hope that it would lead to the opposite reaction [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3119.38s)]
*  But I I guess you know, he was a guy I think the famous [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3123.7799999999997s)]
*  Philosophers he quoted is uh, you know the choosing [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3126.96s)]
*  Uh order over justice and maybe in thinking that was some sort of virtuous thing, but I don't know I would disagree [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3130.82s)]
*  Yeah, and it's a piece of foreign policy. That's a piece of foreign policy [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3136.34s)]
*  But if you drain all the values out of it, like what's left, you know, um, that's the point. That's the point [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3139.94s)]
*  Okay, we are going to take a quick break and we come back [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3146.1000000000004s)]
*  You'll hear my interview with senator peter welch [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3147.94s)]
*  About why he called for a ceasefire in gaza and the efforts to pass the ukraine funding bill and much more [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3150.58s)]
*  So stick around for that potty the world is brought to you by simply safe [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3156.1800000000003s)]
*  Did you know that according to fbi data break-ins and property theft spike this time of year? [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3159.46s)]

*  Thank you. So I just want to start with your call for an indefinite ceasefire [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3314.58s)]
*  Why did you think now was the right time to make that call? [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3319.7s)]
*  And can you sketch out what that looks like in practice? [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3322.82s)]
*  Because there's been a lot of confusion about what a humanitarian pause is or a temporary ceasefire versus what you're calling for [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3325.46s)]
*  Um, I can but if you just didn't just give me a moment [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3331.3s)]
*  I just we have to all of us acknowledge what incredibly horrendous [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3335.3s)]
*  Uh thing happened to the israelis with the incredibly violent attack by hamas [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3340.5s)]
*  So it was brutal [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3346.42s)]
*  Uh, it was gleeful in some cases [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3348.1s)]
*  and horrendous and [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3350.9s)]
*  I saw the video that the [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3353.86s)]
*  The idf the israeli depends force compiled it was from [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3356.6600000000003s)]
*  gopro [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3360.6600000000003s)]
*  video of hamas where in some cases they were [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3361.94s)]
*  Reporting on site the abominations that they were doing [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3366.58s)]
*  with pride and [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3371.7000000000003s)]
*  Today I met with some families from israel whose loved ones are being held hostage [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3373.78s)]
*  so all of us who are [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3379.94s)]
*  Like me have called for a ceasefire. I think it's really really important to acknowledge the horrendous [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3382.9s)]
*  uh [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3389.38s)]
*  catastrophic consequences to the israeli families [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3390.8s)]
*  and uh understand where they're [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3394.98s)]
*  Where they're coming from [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3397.2200000000003s)]
*  And israel has a right to defend itself clearly but the question is how they do it really really matters and the netanyahu war plan [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3399.2200000000003s)]
*  Has relied on extensive use of air power in some cases [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3407.86s)]
*  2,000-pound bombs [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3413.04s)]
*  That were paid for and provided by the united states that were dropped on refugee camps [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3414.7400000000002s)]
*  And what i've seen in terms of the war plan [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3419.78s)]
*  Is that there's a use of bombing in one of the most densely populated? [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3423.62s)]
*  sectors of the world, you know where by definition [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3429.2200000000003s)]
*  Whatever your target may be if you have a hamas person on the fourth floor of an apartment building [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3433.8s)]
*  Uh, and you drop a bomb in that building and take it all down. There's going to be a huge number of civilian casualties [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3439.96s)]
*  Uh, and that's just not right [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3446.44s)]
*  The right to there's a right to defend yourself and respond [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3448.36s)]
*  but there's a right to civilians have not to be [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3452.2000000000003s)]
*  um the [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3455.4s)]
*  collateral damage in a war [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3456.84s)]
*  And what I came to the conclusion was when I [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3459.2400000000002s)]
*  Fall for the ceasefire was that the netanyahu war plan is going to continue [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3462.36s)]
*  with bombing as a central element [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3468.44s)]
*  and [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3471.2400000000002s)]
*  By definition once you're dropping 2,000-pound bombs or you're bombing in populated areas, which is essentially what gaza is [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3472.36s)]
*  You're going to have a catastrophic loss of civilian life [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3479.7200000000003s)]
*  And in addition to this you had a million and a half [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3482.76s)]
*  1.7 million people literally displaced from their homes. They were told to get out of gaza city in the north of gaza [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3486.98s)]
*  They're now in the south of gaza [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3493.48s)]
*  Many of them were told to go to this town of khan mutus [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3495.5600000000004s)]
*  before the campaign it was about 150,000 people it's close to 500,000 people now [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3499.48s)]
*  And that city is getting bombed. So people who were told to go south did so [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3506.2000000000003s)]
*  Leaving behind everything that they had and are now under bombardment and being told to go elsewhere [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3511.96s)]
*  So the humanitarian catastrophe is just immense [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3519.0s)]
*  We just haven't seen this. It's 15,000 [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3524.2799999999997s)]
*  Palestinian civilians killed most of those women and children the one and a half million people 1.7 million people were displaced [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3527.3199999999997s)]
*  And now from the un [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3534.84s)]
*  There's a real concern that there's going to be more loss of life from disease [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3537.24s)]
*  Possibly starvation and as long as the bombing is going on [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3541.08s)]
*  It's going to be very difficult if not impossible to get humanitarian aid and to keep body and soul together for the palestinians [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3545.24s)]
*  the reason why I called for it when I did is I [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3552.84s)]
*  number one saw [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3556.04s)]
*  What was happening as we all did with the civilian loss of life? [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3557.64s)]
*  I called for it when there was the first glimmer of hope in this horrendous situation and that was this the [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3561.48s)]
*  humanitarian pause [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3568.42s)]
*  And in that humanitarian pause [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3570.36s)]
*  There was success on hostage negotiations and the release of many hostages [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3572.92s)]
*  For the first time aid workers were able to get humanitarian aid in and start setting up some structures [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3577.96s)]
*  and what I [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3584.36s)]
*  Saw was look. We just can't stop this pause. We've got to [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3586.04s)]
*  have a ceasefire [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3591.0s)]
*  so that number one [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3592.92s)]
*  Palestinians innocent palestinians who have nowhere to go are not going to be under [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3595.3s)]
*  Continued bombardment [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3600.02s)]
*  Number two we can set up [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3602.04s)]
*  Humanitarian relief in it so that it can be delivered in a consistent [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3605.38s)]
*  uh in reliable way [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3609.8s)]
*  And number three, you know the negotiations [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3612.12s)]
*  Ultimately, this is going to have to be a political resolution and the more negotiations particularly with the active engagement of our partners [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3615.06s)]
*  like egypt and qatar that played such a [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3623.2400000000002s)]
*  constructive role in the hostage negotiations [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3626.1800000000003s)]
*  See what happens. It can't be worse than the bombing. Yeah. No, I look i'm no military expert or expert on ordinance [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3629.64s)]
*  But I too was struck by some of the reporting early that the israelis were primarily dropping 500 pound thousand pound and in some cases [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3635.8s)]
*  2,000 pound dumb bombs without any gps coordinates on these densely populated areas. That is [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3642.82s)]
*  absolutely a recipe for massive civilian casualties and as uh, [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3648.2000000000003s)]
*  Secretary of defense loyd austin warned if you're not protecting civilians it can lead to strategic failure long term in gaza [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3653.4s)]
*  You also wrote in that statement about the ceasefire [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3660.7599999999998s)]
*  Quote the president has asked congress to provide more than 14 billion for israel to pursue its war plans against hamas [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3664.44s)]
*  The manner in which any such aid is provided must be debated [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3670.12s)]
*  I will push for policies that ensure taxpayer dollars are only used in ways that comply with international humanitarian law [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3673.16s)]
*  Can you elaborate a bit on on what that means and how you might want to ensure the taxpayer dollars are only used in accordance with [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3680.04s)]
*  uh international law well international law requires [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3687.48s)]
*  respect for civilians and that the warring parties take every precaution to [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3690.92s)]
*  Minimize the loss of civilian life [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3697.94s)]
*  And what we have in gaza is a horrendous organization hamas [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3701.0800000000004s)]
*  Which is a legitimate target [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3707.4s)]
*  But we have over two million palestinians who are being oppressed in fact by hamas [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3710.36s)]
*  Being used as human shields. So this creates a dilemma for israel [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3717.0s)]
*  But even as there is an acknowledged dilemma that I recognize [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3721.2400000000002s)]
*  There's a obligation [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3725.96s)]
*  to avoid as much as possible for loss of civilian life [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3728.52s)]
*  And the way I would just give an example you can't drop a 2 000 pound bomb on a refugee camp [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3733.4s)]
*  Even if you have a hamas target right there [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3740.04s)]
*  without inevitably causing the loss of life of a lot of very innocent [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3742.76s)]
*  Uh palestinian women children and adults who are not part of the mas [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3747.46s)]
*  So my view here is that bombing has a strategy in the war? [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3751.7200000000003s)]
*  Uh is it it can only lead to unacceptable? [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3756.84s)]
*  Loss of civilian life [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3761.58s)]
*  Again, it's like being in manhattan, you know, you might have a target that's a legitimate target on the 44th floor of the empire state building [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3763.9s)]
*  But if people on every other floor are innocent civilians, do you blow up the building? [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3771.8199999999997s)]
*  and you know [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3776.94s)]
*  And gaza is so densely populated it creates that it creates that dilemma [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3778.8599999999997s)]
*  So my view is that we should be doing all we can to help israel with the iron dome that has saved [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3783.98s)]
*  Countless lives. I think we should be doing all we can on humanitarian relief [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3790.94s)]
*  But I don't support the bombing campaign [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3795.74s)]
*  So as an example of what I prefer to not do is be providing more 2 000 bonds to the net nyahuu [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3797.74s)]
*  War plan. Yeah, your um your colleague in the senate in vermont bernie sanders has also [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3806.2999999999997s)]
*  Called on israel to agree to allow displaced gossips to return home [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3812.94s)]
*  An agreement for israel to agree to not occupy gaza the settlement freeze an end to settler violence in the west bank and a commitment [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3817.74s)]
*  To peace talks with the goal of a two-state solution. So it sounds like you know bernie wants to [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3824.62s)]
*  Use this u.s assistance as leverage to tackle the underlying [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3830.54s)]
*  Political disputes the israeli-palestinian conflict and try to get back into talks around a two-state solution [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3836.06s)]
*  Do you think [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3842.3s)]
*  That's the right way to use u.s leverage. That's something you would support as well [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3843.5s)]
*  But it's official u.s policy with republican presidents and democratic presidents that work for a two-state solution [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3847.9s)]
*  Now the reality is and I think bernie's uh, uh, [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3855.02s)]
*  Advocacy here gets to this we've paid lip service to it [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3858.78s)]
*  We say we're for a two-state solution [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3863.26s)]
*  Net nyahu nods and then totally disregards [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3865.9s)]
*  So, you know the net nyahu government [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3869.84s)]
*  Has in its policy its written policy basically that they want to annex the west bank [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3872.64s)]
*  So it's bizarre to me [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3879.2799999999997s)]
*  That one administration after another says we're for two states [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3882.0s)]
*  Net nyahu just nods and smiles and says what he wants to say and then we act as though we heard what we wanted to hear [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3886.16s)]
*  When in fact written into their platform is a one-state solution, which means the annexation of the west bank [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3893.04s)]
*  so [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3899.52s)]
*  This moment here if I have any hope at all [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3900.4s)]
*  It is a realization that it's not just that one we have to be serious [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3904.4s)]
*  We mean two-state because that's the only way that we're going to have [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3910.0s)]
*  Palestinians and israelis living side by side [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3914.3s)]
*  And where we maintain what is really core to jewish identity in israel and that is israel as a democratic and jewish [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3917.92s)]
*  state [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3926.48s)]
*  second [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3928.16s)]
*  We now have a situation where we've got the active engagement of arab states who have to play a major role [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3929.2s)]
*  Because they are the ones that can provide some assurance [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3936.08s)]
*  To palestinians that their rights will be respected but also with israel that they'll respect israel's right to be the democratic and jewish state [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3939.7599999999998s)]
*  Let me give a little step back just a second [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3948.3199999999997s)]
*  When you think about where was israel in october 6th? [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3950.96s)]
*  In respect to its arab neighbors, it was never stronger [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3954.32s)]
*  You know keep in mind in the 73 war all the arab states as nation states [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3959.84s)]
*  Had his goal the elimination of israel [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3964.88s)]
*  Now israel has normalized relations [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3968.7200000000003s)]
*  With so many of its neighbors and was on the precipice of having a normalized relationship with saudi arabia. So internationally [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3972.32s)]
*  there was [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3980.2400000000002s)]
*  In among the arab states there was real recognition of israel's right to exist israel as a democratic and jewish state [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3982.0s)]
*  In respect for israel's accomplishments where israel was having a problem was on the west bank and that was [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3988.96s)]
*  in my view [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3995.76s)]
*  significantly [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3997.26s)]
*  aggravated by the [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=3998.54s)]
*  Permission the netanyahu government to violent settlers and aggressive settlers to really try to displace innocent [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4000.24s)]
*  Palestinians living in their own land and of course the netanyahu government that [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4006.72s)]
*  In effect had a policy towards hamas [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4012.0s)]
*  to accept them [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4015.2s)]
*  as a way of dividing the palestinians the hamas leadership versus the palestinian authority leadership [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4016.7999999999997s)]
*  And of course there's no question that the netanyahu government was completely asleep at the switch when it came to the basic function [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4025.68s)]
*  And responsibility that a government has and that is to protect its borders from [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4032.88s)]
*  Incursion by what they what is a potential threat totally asleep at the switch [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4037.5s)]
*  So we have a situation here where the good news is arab states are engaged [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4043.84s)]
*  Arab states recognize israel arab states don't want a conflict in the east [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4048.48s)]
*  But we have a bad situation with the netanyahu government that has done everything it can to impede if not unravel the [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4053.04s)]
*  Possibility of a two-state solution [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4060.86s)]
*  so [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4063.52s)]
*  My hope is that we don't know how this is going to end or when it's going to end [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4064.7200000000003s)]
*  But it's going to end ultimately if it's going to be successful with arab states playing a major role to help [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4069.1200000000003s)]
*  uh [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4076.1600000000003s)]
*  give israel confidence and [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4077.2000000000003s)]
*  palestinians assurance that their aspirations for an independent separate peaceful state that does recognize israel can [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4080.3s)]
*  Co-exist what you said at the beginning there about the u.s [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4088.3s)]
*  Paying lip service to the two-state solution and the kind of wink nods but going about you know business as usual from bbnyahu [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4091.12s)]
*  is [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4099.2s)]
*  refreshing to hear completely accurate [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4100.08s)]
*  backed up by public statements, but I feel like doesn't often get [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4102.96s)]
*  Said as bluntly in washington. I mean when my old boss brock obama [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4108.32s)]
*  Would criticize what he perceived as sort of a lack of commitment [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4112.88s)]
*  from [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4116.96s)]
*  The netanyahu government to the peace talks. We got hammered in the press [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4118.16s)]
*  You know biden has pursued this hug bb strategy of not wanting to criticize [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4122.48s)]
*  the israeli government publicly do you think [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4128.88s)]
*  that approach [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4132.639999999999s)]
*  Has been the right approach and do you worry about the way this seems to have split the democratic party recently? [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4134.96s)]
*  Well, no, I am I am worried. I mean [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4140.4s)]
*  I'm the most what i'm worried about more than anything is the continuation of the loss of innocent palestinian life [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4142.72s)]
*  I mean, I was in gaza a number of years ago. I've been israel in the west bank several times [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4149.12s)]
*  But that is tough living in for for families [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4154.320000000001s)]
*  And you know the palestinians have the lowest illiteracy rate in the highest [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4159.12s)]
*  Unemployment rate in the world. I think that's close to I think that's right [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4165.200000000001s)]
*  Uh, so there's really good people with a lot of future if they have some opportunity [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4170.400000000001s)]
*  but I think what has happened over the course of years is that [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4177.200000000001s)]
*  israel was a state besieged [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4181.360000000001s)]
*  You know the 73 war their war for independence [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4183.92s)]
*  And they had the active hostility [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4187.92s)]
*  Of arab states that as nation states were committed to unraveling with israel killing jews [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4190.88s)]
*  And destroying the israeli state [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4198.08s)]
*  That's terrible in the u.s. Was its staunch ally [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4200.64s)]
*  Israel has now a very successful state [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4204.56s)]
*  very strong strongest military in the region and has one [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4208.72s)]
*  Acceptance long overdue from those arab state neighbors [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4214.16s)]
*  But has this internal problem? [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4217.76s)]
*  Where the right wing has become ascendant in israeli politics [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4220.64s)]
*  Its agenda is the incorporation of the palestinian territories as they would call it or juda and [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4225.6s)]
*  samaria the west bank in gaza into israel proper in that super right wing with people like ben gavir [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4232.48s)]
*  Uh are explicitly racist towards [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4239.84s)]
*  Palestinians and that's the government that's in control and I think where you see a split [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4243.74s)]
*  Is a lot of people my generation [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4249.6s)]
*  We're so horrified by the holocaust [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4252.320000000001s)]
*  And we saw israel as this [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4255.6s)]
*  Incredible refuge and safe safe space for jews who've been so persecuted [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4258.96s)]
*  culminating in horrendous [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4264.620000000001s)]
*  holocaust [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4267.360000000001s)]
*  And then you have a lot of younger people who've seen israel as a strong state [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4268.96s)]
*  As a confident state strong military strong economy [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4272.96s)]
*  but have identified with [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4277.52s)]
*  Uh the suffering of palestinians most explicitly in the recent bombing in gaza [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4279.92s)]
*  Where people have been driven from their homes and have no home to return to so that is a split [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4286.72s)]
*  uh, and [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4292.240000000001s)]
*  I think the goal that all of us should have is to be supporting the peacemakers on both sides [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4294.160000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of israelis who have been strong advocates for a two-state solution [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4300.160000000001s)]
*  And there's been a lot of palestinians who argued that they have the responsibility [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4304.88s)]
*  To build their own society up, but that has to include recognition of the legitimate rights of the [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4310.5599999999995s)]
*  of the israeli people [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4318.64s)]
*  So I think we should be looking at this from the perspective of who are the peacemakers and democrats on both sides [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4320.88s)]
*  and the idea that we're in this war [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4328.0s)]
*  Where there's this use of [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4331.68s)]
*  Very significant amount of bombing I mean more bombs have been dropped [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4334.56s)]
*  In a couple of months than all of the time we were in afghanistan [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4338.320000000001s)]
*  In a very very small area this humanitarian catastrophe. I think is really bad news [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4342.88s)]
*  obviously for the people in gaza the palestinians, but I think for the prospects [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4349.5s)]
*  Long term of maintaining support for israel and the u.s [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4356.0s)]
*  So I think it's time to reassess. Yeah, I agree. Um, I know president biden is pushing [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4359.84s)]
*  to pass a [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4366.08s)]
*  106 billion dollar supplemental funding bill for israel ukraine [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4367.4400000000005s)]
*  Taiwan some border priorities other defense funding for a while [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4372.24s)]
*  It seemed like there was a deal coming together [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4376.32s)]
*  That married that spending with reforms to immigration to the asylum process [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4379.2s)]
*  Those talks maybe seem to have fallen apart in the last few days [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4385.52s)]
*  I've been reading quotes from senator chris murphy your colleague on the democratic side that make me feel that way [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4389.04s)]
*  Who was it geez mitt romney had some tough words today about [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4396.24s)]
*  The democratic position those talks wondering how hopeful you are [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4399.92s)]
*  That this ukraine and israel funding gets passed [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4403.52s)]
*  And what changes to immigration policy you think democrats should be willing to accept? Well [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4406.88s)]
*  Number one, I I think we'll get there because we have to get there [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4412.16s)]
*  But we're making a hard thing harder [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4416.48s)]
*  You know, the ukraine aid has a lot of support in the senate. There's some erosion significant erosion of support in the republican side of the house [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4419.36s)]
*  That's existential because if they run out of money [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4427.84s)]
*  They run out of the capacity to defend themselves and we're literally scraping the bottom of the piggy bank right now [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4431.04s)]
*  That's really essential [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4439.04s)]
*  number two [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4441.5199999999995s)]
*  The israeli aid has a lot of support. There's some of us who think we really have to have a debate about [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4443.12s)]
*  Bombs, we have to have some debate about what conditions not just the blind check [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4449.36s)]
*  But by and large the money that goes to the iron dome protects [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4454.24s)]
*  Israeli citizens from incoming rocket attacks by hamas [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4459.04s)]
*  In humanitarian aid strong support the border is an important issue and i'll be candid. I think democrats have been a little bit [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4463.04s)]
*  Asleep at the switch here because the situation at the border right now is so different than it was 10 or 15 years ago [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4471.36s)]
*  That there's a huge numbers of people and it's not the [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4477.76s)]
*  places that it was 10 or 15 years ago from the from the [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4481.44s)]
*  The triangle countries that were in guatemala honduras and al salvador [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4486.32s)]
*  It's like china people fly into ecuador and then coming up the darien gap and two or three million people [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4491.04s)]
*  That's a real issue and I think democrats have to come to the table and it has to include looking at some policy changes [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4496.32s)]
*  And we would of course hope to include getting status for the dreamers and we would [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4503.679999999999s)]
*  Want to get the higher numbers of people who can come here legally through the process [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4510.719999999999s)]
*  The difficulty I see that we're creating [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4516.48s)]
*  Is that this question of border? [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4519.92s)]
*  Which I think is extremely important [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4522.4s)]
*  Shouldn't be tied in my view to the existential challenge that ukraine has [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4525.4400000000005s)]
*  So while we have a legitimate debate about the border [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4530.240000000001s)]
*  And it's coming up late and it's getting connected and tied to something so profoundly important for the well-being of uh of ukraine [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4533.76s)]
*  And our nato alliance [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4542.320000000001s)]
*  My preference is that we wouldn't connect them [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4544.56s)]
*  The republicans see it otherwise [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4547.6s)]
*  And then there's the [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4550.400000000001s)]
*  Negotiation that's going on now [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4552.54s)]
*  Where people like senator murphy I think are [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4554.56s)]
*  Acknowledging the need that democrats have to make some significant changes in our approach status quo will work [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4557.26s)]
*  But you're having in the lurking in the background a lot of the trump effect [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4564.96s)]
*  Where the republicans are only going to accept what is okay with trump and that's crackpot quite frankly [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4569.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, um final question for you. You have the pleasure of working with alabama senator tommy tuberville [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4576.8s)]
*  Um for the past 10 months he has been holding up all military promotions because he doesn't like president biden's [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4583.46s)]
*  policy on abortion [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4590.18s)]
*  In dod we are talking about holds on [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4592.580000000001s)]
*  Uh 450 u.s service members that impacts their lives their family's lives [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4596.4800000000005s)]
*  They're trying to figure out where they get to live where they enroll their kids in school [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4601.14s)]
*  They're just literally being their lives are being held hostage by this clown [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4604.02s)]
*  But much like auburn did against alabama a couple weeks back it seems like [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4608.58s)]
*  Tommy tuberville has uh fumbled the punt right at the end here [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4614.0199999999995s)]
*  He has agreed to narrow his hold to just 10 promotions at the four star rank [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4617.139999999999s)]
*  To prevent senator schumer from moving on a vote to get around him basically and break this logjam [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4622.9s)]
*  It doesn't sound like tuberville got any other concessions my question for you is [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4628.26s)]
*  Do you ever feel like the senate's a little too congenial and maybe dumb stunts like this? [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4632.9s)]
*  Shouldn't be allowed to linger for so long [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4637.139999999999s)]
*  I really do you know and I was talking to my some of my colleagues and my republican colleagues were upset about this and by the [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4638.82s)]
*  Way, I just voted along with the rest of the senate [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4644.58s)]
*  Uh on block to move all except 10 of those nominations and it was very painful for the families and terrible and unjustified [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4648.0199999999995s)]
*  But the argument I had with some of my colleagues is I say look, you know, there are these prerogatives in the senate [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4656.42s)]
*  like a hold [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4663.46s)]
*  But in order for them to be justified they can only be preserved if any senator who has that prerogative [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4665.14s)]
*  Exercises it with restraint [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4674.160000000001s)]
*  And when it gets abused as it did in the tuberville situation [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4677.62s)]
*  If we're willing to tolerate an abuse of that whole provision [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4682.58s)]
*  We not only look like we care more about our prerogatives than national defense [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4688.26s)]
*  We're acting in a way that indicates we care more about our prerogatives in national defense [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4693.860000000001s)]
*  So my view is no [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4699.38s)]
*  If senators are going to abuse a prerogative that we have that in other situations with limited [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4701.14s)]
*  Application may serve a point in a valid purpose if we start abusing that we can't be [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4709.120000000001s)]
*  We shouldn't have that prerogative that is abused by our colleagues [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4715.700000000001s)]
*  So [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4720.02s)]
*  No, we've got to take a look in the mirror here and not allow this to happen. Amen to that [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4720.900000000001s)]
*  well, i'm very glad you guys took this vote and broke that logjam for all those families and for [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4724.9800000000005s)]
*  uh our entire uh [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4729.62s)]
*  All the folks serving in the u.s military senator welch. Thank you so much for uh for doing the show and for your thoughtful work [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4731.7s)]
*  On all these issues. I really do appreciate it. Thank you. You know, it was really great to be with you. Thank you [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4737.14s)]
*  Thanks to go to senator welch ben. Thanks again for doing a road game for us. Good to see you in the uk [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4742.1s)]
*  Yeah, good to see you in the live in the flesh next week. All right, buddy talk soon [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-c0k3UrS_s&t=4746.1s)]
