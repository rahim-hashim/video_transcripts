Video Description: Tommy Vietor and Ben Rhodes discuss the growing divide between the US and Europe on Ukraine policy, Germany’s election results and what they tell us about the strength of right-wing populism, how a right-wing MAGA podcaster became Trumps new deputy FBI Director, and Trump’s purge of senior Pentagon leaders. They also discuss the cruelty of Trump’s deportation efforts, the right-wing international leaders at CPAC, and why the Gaza ceasefire is strained after the latest hostage release. Then, Tommy speaks to Bloomberg Businessweek reporter Zeke Faux about international crypto currency scams, government corruption, and how the Trump family is tied up in all of it.

# Donald Trump Pushes the US and Europe Further Apart Over Ukraine Policy
**Pod Save the World:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0)
*  Welcome back to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Ben Rhodes. Welcome to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=0.0s)]
*  1930s Germany then [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5.12s)]
*  Take our off off my conversation on I'm two-thirds of the way through a three-volume history of the Third Reich [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=7.48s)]
*  I've purchased it a long time ago. I started it. I just I'm almost done with the Third Reich in power [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  It's excellent. It is a little too on the nose [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=19.2s)]
*  I have to say the capitulation of all aspects of [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=23.0s)]
*  German society to what they thought was a temporal threat of [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=26.72s)]
*  fascist government, but anyway [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=30.88s)]
*  What we could have like a Nazi book club because I've been you're doing some deep reading [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=33.4s)]
*  So what else you got I still recommend darkness over Germany [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=39.08s)]

*  Then there's a book called a town in the Third Reich. That's similar vibes [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  It's like a reconstruction of how one town dealt with it's like the town the famous boss [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=53.8s)]
*  I don't know if there's a role for Affleck [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=58.32s)]
*  By the way, I should say I mean we're still waiting for the sequel to the town [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=61.48s)]
*  They're doing a sequel to the they should okay saying I want to know what happened a flack [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=65.0s)]
*  Wasn't he going down to the Florida Keys or something at the end? Oh, that's right. Spoiler. Yeah, sorry. I don't really remember [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well, we're in we're all in a dark place here as you can tell listener [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=76.32s)]
*  Yes, but that's okay, I guess that was that's usually the humorous banter yeah [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=80.42s)]
*  Well, we got a lot to cover today [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=88.3s)]
*  We're gonna talk about three year anniversary of the war in Ukraine and Trump's efforts to negotiate an end to the war [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=89.94s)]
*  While extorting as much as possible from Ukrainian government [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=96.06s)]
*  We're also going to talk about the results the German election and what it all means [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=99.53999999999999s)]
*  The newest addition to the team at the FBI were very excited to tell you more about that one [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=103.22s)]
*  Then there was Trump's Friday night massacre at the Pentagon [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=109.02000000000001s)]
*  We've got a button update on a bunch of immigration news because it's been hard to keep track of the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=111.82000000000001s)]
*  We'll tell you about the bizarre collection of international leaders in air quotes at CPAC [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=116.58s)]
*  Everyone's favorite conservative political conference and then the latest news from Gaza and the West Bank and then got you guys [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=123.9s)]
*  We'll hear my interview with Zeke Fox. He's an investigative reporter at Bloomberg Businessweek [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=130.82s)]
*  We go all into the the crypto corruption stuff then you're going to enjoy this talk about the the Trump coin [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=135.01999999999998s)]
*  Javier Malay down in Argentina. There's another crypto, you know billionaire type who seems to be paying off the Trump family [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=142.26s)]
*  No, it's the Washington corruption. I think this crypto beat is gonna be an important sub story [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=149.38s)]
*  You know not the a story, but it's a you know right below it. I think it's where the money's gonna move [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=154.42s)]
*  Yeah, if you're a follow the money kind of guy or gal [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=159.76s)]
*  Crypto [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=162.94s)]
*  Get on the blockchain [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=164.94s)]
*  Well, let's talk about Ukraine first because Monday was a three-year anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine the full-scale Russian invasion [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=166.26000000000002s)]
*  According to Ukrainian officials Russia marked the occasion by firing their largest drone volley at Ukraine ever [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=173.02s)]
*  But the biggest threat to Ukraine's future sovereignty now seems to be coming from Russia and the United States [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=179.58s)]
*  Which is a welcome addition for everyone [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=185.62s)]
*  There are a bunch of European leaders that flew to Kiev this week to offer more assistance and moral support [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  I think the UK offered five billion dollars spanned a billion [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=192.2s)]
*  The EU is reportedly preparing about a twenty billion dollar aid package, but obviously none of that is gonna fill the gap [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=195.23999999999998s)]
*  That seems to be about to be left by the US [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=201.12s)]
*  French president Emmanuel Macron traveled to DC to personally lobby Trump on all things Ukraine and pitch an idea for a post-war [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=203.79999999999998s)]
*  international peacekeeping force [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=210.44s)]
*  Macron said during their joint press conference that a peace deal must quote not mean surrender of Ukraine and then it must allow for [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=212.04s)]
*  Ukrainian sovereignty [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=219.72s)]
*  Macron also pushed back on Trump's claim that all European aid to Ukraine was just a loan and that they were gonna get paid back [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=221.36s)]
*  Whereas the US is somehow getting screwed. Here's a clip of that back and forth in the oval [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=227.56s)]
*  I support the idea to have Ukraine first being compensated because they are the ones who have [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=234.16s)]
*  Loose a lot of their fellow citizens and being destroyed by this attack second all of those who paid for [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=239.6s)]
*  Could be compensated but not by a grain by Russia because there was a month of rest [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=246.35999999999999s)]
*  Europe is loaning the money to Ukraine they get their money back. No, in fact to be to be frank [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=254.79999999999998s)]
*  We paid we paid 60% of the total defaults and it was who I like the US loans [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=261.03999999999996s)]
*  Guarantee grants and we provided the real money to be clear. So fun. Yeah [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=267.92s)]
*  Sure is fun after the pool left. Yeah, I just slapped around [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=274.28000000000003s)]
*  So then this meeting with Macron comes as the US and Ukraine are reportedly close to signing an agreement [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=277.6s)]
*  regarding Ukraine's mineral reserves [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=285.0s)]
*  Initially Trump had seemingly demanded half of the profits from Ukraine exploiting its natural resources up to maybe 500 billion, which is [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=287.64s)]
*  All the money we've given Ukraine for the war at times too [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=296.03999999999996s)]
*  I believe now it sounds like it's some sort of joint development fund where the US will also have access to this cash that [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=298.96s)]
*  Will later be used for reconstruction [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=304.91999999999996s)]
*  It's not clear exactly. It's still all of it is lacking, you know what the Ukrainians really want which is a US security guarantee [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=307.47999999999996s)]
*  They're framing this as well more economic cooperation between the US and Ukraine is a de facto [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=315.23999999999995s)]
*  You know security guarantee because the Russians won't invade if we have skin in the game or something. It doesn't make any sense [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=320.96s)]
*  Yeah, Trump basically views this as payback for USA [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=326.44s)]
*  But as Lenski is noted payback seems to include a 100% interest rate charge in an interview with Russian state TV [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=330.79999999999995s)]
*  Putin also suggested that Russia was ready to work with the US on extracting rare earth [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=337.35999999999996s)]
*  Minerals and he suggested that the focus of his conversation with Trump and the talks in Saudi Arabia weren't really on ending the war [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=343.12s)]
*  And then that he was open to this weird idea that Trump floated the other day about a joint 50% reduction in defense spending [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=350.52000000000004s)]
*  I don't know man. It's just baffling. Everything is confusing these days black is white up is down [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=356.52000000000004s)]
*  yes, what did you make of Macron's visit and [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=360.72s)]
*  Kind of where they're at on this mineral deal and these floats by Putin about like cooperation on mineral reserve exploitation [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=364.72s)]
*  Like what are we talking about this one? I think it's important [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=372.78000000000003s)]
*  And we will try to do this every week to kind of step back from all the [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=376.12s)]
*  strange back and forth day to day and just [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=381.56s)]
*  Look at where we are, which is that all of the discussion right now is about [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=386.08s)]
*  What Ukraine needs to give up right and not Russia the country that invaded Ukraine to us [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=392.12s)]
*  I know yeah, I know that's an obvious point, but I know but at no point in your wind and and this dude [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=398.52s)]
*  No fault of your own. It's because of Donald Trump. Was there any discussion? What is Russia? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=403.64s)]
*  Conceding, you know even any bits of the territory that they're currently occupying or trying to annex or returning children that they've kidnapped or [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=408.28s)]
*  paying any reparation like that's all gone and [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=416.88s)]
*  All we're talking about is what does Ukraine need to give to Russia in terms of territory? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=419.52s)]
*  And what do they need to give to the US in terms of these bizarre mineral rights, right? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=423.71999999999997s)]
*  And this was manifest by the way that UN General Assembly vote where the US voted with Russia and North Korea and Belarus [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=427.71999999999997s)]
*  Even Cuba and Iran abstained [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=435.56s)]
*  Against Europe and it says to be clear the first time since 1945 that the US has voted with Russia and against Europe on any [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=438.2s)]
*  UN resolution that's that's where we're at right on this mineral deal [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=445.03999999999996s)]
*  It's truly baffling that we're spending this much time thinking and talking about something that is clearly [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=450.0s)]
*  Manufactured bullshit, you know [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=456.02s)]
*  Trump needs to feel like he extracted something from the Ukrainians because of the support we've given them [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=458.18s)]
*  Not only is that ghoulish we talked about that last week. It's not real [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=463.90000000000003s)]
*  This idea that if the US has some mineral rights in Ukraine, that's tantamount to a security guarantee [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=468.5s)]
*  So Russia won't invade that makes no sense [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=474.22s)]
*  It just is a way for Trump to claim that he won something at the negotiating table from the Ukrainians that you know [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=478.22s)]
*  Let's be clear if Ukraine is swallowed up by Russia. That doesn't matter if Ukraine is a kind of de facto [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=485.02s)]
*  Squeezed borderline failed state because Russia is kind of strangling them. It's not like it's gonna be some minerals bonanza [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=491.02s)]
*  It's not even clear, you know Trump hasn't even specified like why we need these minerals [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=497.78s)]
*  It's just pure showmanship and the fact that Putin wants in on this he wants in on it because he would like nothing more [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=502.14s)]
*  Than the US to say oh sure we will [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=507.9s)]
*  Extract natural resources and minerals from the Russian occupied [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=510.74s)]
*  Territories of Ukraine because if the US starts doing business and like Lhansk and Donetsk and more opal that is not only [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=514.4200000000001s)]
*  recognizing the Russian [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=523.0600000000001s)]
*  Occupation and annexation of those regions that's kind of fully legitimizing normalizing it [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=524.9s)]
*  You know suddenly we're doing business in those places [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=529.26s)]
*  So I think McCrone was trying his best and was worth the effort [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=531.94s)]
*  To just try to like moderate the US a diplomatic helmet. Yeah, it was a diplomatic helmet. He's trying to moderate [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=537.52s)]
*  Like Trump's anti Ukraine position try to make a better deal on this mineral thing [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=544.08s)]
*  Try to probably just get past this hang up on minerals and return the conversation to security guarantees [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=549.24s)]
*  I'm sure he was there to talk about the potential European force the French and British and potentially other nations force [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=554.12s)]
*  It would be in Ukraine on the back end and just try to you know [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=560.5s)]
*  Dampen his enthusiasm for butting up to Putin and we don't really know how that went [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=564.36s)]
*  because McCrone can't come out and say if he achieved something because he [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=569.4s)]
*  Doesn't want to antagonize Trump and you know wake up to a truth social tirade [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=573.28s)]
*  But it seemed like it helped a little bit [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=578.04s)]
*  I don't know that the terms of this mineral deal are better than the ones that were offered that Zalinsky [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=580.1999999999999s)]
*  Rejected a couple weeks ago. They were essentially just give us all these rights now [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=584.4799999999999s)]
*  It's at least a joint venture. So McCrone does seem to have moved the goalpost a little bit on this [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=588.4599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, good work. And then you will yeah, I mean just to to go back to your point about like don't forget the big picture [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=592.48s)]
*  I mean, I was just thinking about the United Nations, which was yeah pretty broken [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=598.88s)]
*  ineffective kind of a mess [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=604.32s)]
*  Like six months ago now [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=606.64s)]
*  We've just decided to become part of the problem [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=609.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean, I assume what will happen going forward is, you know Trump will tell at least Stefanic if she's confirmed [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=613.44s)]
*  They don't think they've had a hearing for her yet because they still need her vote in the house to just attack the institution [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=618.98s)]
*  Defend Israel everywhere. They're pulling out of the Human Rights Commission [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=625.22s)]
*  I mean talk about another like we talked about last week Trump turning away from NATO which was set up in [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=628.4200000000001s)]
*  1949 to deter Russian aggression against Europe. I [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=634.78s)]
*  Suspect the next thing we'll see is the US just kind of like fully [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=639.3000000000001s)]
*  pulling away from the UN or rendering it just [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=643.22s)]
*  Useless even at the Security Council level. Yeah, it's already been paralyzed at the Security Council level for a while now [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=646.9s)]
*  Sorry, I'm at the General Assembly. Yeah, but but the General Assembly, you know [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=652.9s)]
*  I saw some people kind of laughing rolling eyes about the General Assembly matters because it is [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=655.9399999999999s)]
*  Like a barometer of how you're showing up in the world. It's a global roll call. Yeah, it's a global roll call [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=661.58s)]
*  Where do you stand on these things and? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=665.28s)]
*  It matters, you know [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=667.3199999999999s)]
*  It's one of these things where if it didn't matter then people wouldn't care so much, you know [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=670.2s)]
*  Us kind of showing up at the world by saying we're on the Russian side Russia wasn't the aggressor [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=675.46s)]
*  I mean that's central we voted against a resolution [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=680.5s)]
*  That specified Russia's aggressor that matters because that tells the rest of the world you better [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=683.5s)]
*  Adjust to that reality and I think what people need to realize is the outcome of that adjustment is not gonna be seen [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=688.5799999999999s)]
*  Tomorrow or two days from now, but two years from now [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=694.74s)]
*  The world will have recalibrated that away from the United States when McCrone goes back to Europe, you know [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=697.66s)]
*  Sure, he might have had to call dear Donald and say nice things to Trump in front of his face [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=702.82s)]
*  But I'm sure the Europeans are just getting together and we'll talk about this and how do we reorient away from the United States? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=707.7800000000001s)]
*  And that's happening all over the world right now. The only other thing I say about the UN is [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=713.6600000000001s)]
*  particularly with the destruction of USAID [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=718.5s)]
*  Who is left to show up in post-conflict zones to show up with foreign assistance to manage? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=721.1s)]
*  refugee flows [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=728.4200000000001s)]
*  It's just the UN system and like philanthropy basically, you know, and so the UN really still matters [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=729.82s)]
*  I mean who's left to fight a pandemic who's dealing with bird flu now with the US is kind of totally evacuating that space [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=735.86s)]
*  The UN system itself matters and it's not just what Elise Stefanik might be voting [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=743.38s)]
*  It's it I'm sure there also be you know choking off funds [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=748.2600000000001s)]
*  Yeah [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=750.94s)]
*  funding of it and so then it's like who's who's paying for these problems that you should care about again on a human level but [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=751.4200000000001s)]
*  On a stability level like if nobody is there to manage migration flows, guess what? There's me more migration [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=758.18s)]
*  You know, nobody's there to stop pandemics. There's me more pandemic. So this dysfunction is going to be [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=764.0799999999999s)]
*  Manifested over time. Yeah one place that reorientation away from the US is happening in real time is Germany [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=770.0999999999999s)]
*  So Germans went to the polls on Sunday [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=776.5799999999999s)]
*  They had an election that saw the largest turnout in the country's history [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=779.26s)]
*  I think it's about 82% of the population voted just incredible [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=782.6999999999999s)]
*  The results were not great but far from the worst outcome [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=786.26s)]
*  So in the not great category the far-right AFD party doubled its support from the last election to about 20% [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=790.7s)]
*  The AFD as we've discussed is seen by many Germans as the heir to the Nazi party [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=796.86s)]
*  They are anti-islam anti immigration anti EU and pro Russia and prominent AFD members have minimized the Holocaust a number of times [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=801.5s)]
*  There's also very extreme factions within the AFD that are seen as extremist threats by domestic intelligence [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=809.62s)]
*  The left-leaning social Democrats or SPD Olaf Schultz party had their worst result since [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=815.34s)]
*  1887 [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=822.38s)]
*  Garnering only 16% of the vote Democrats feel better [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=823.42s)]
*  Yeah, Jesus Christ voters were not thrilled to say the least about the SPT's leadership over the past few years [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=826.22s)]
*  And they made it known at the voting booth [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=833.22s)]
*  It's hard out there for a neoliberal then so the traditional conservative CD party got the largest share of the vote with 28.5% [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=836.5s)]
*  But they fell short of their 30% goal big picture [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=843.9s)]
*  CDU leader Friedrich Merz will almost certainly become the next chancellor [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=847.8s)]
*  He's gonna have to form a government coalition first [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=850.78s)]
*  The good news for him is that he can almost certainly do so just by working with the SPD that will give them enough [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=853.24s)]
*  Votes in the Bundestag to form a government and have a majority [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=860.3s)]
*  They will not have to include a third political party, which would have made things more complicated [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=863.5799999999999s)]
*  Mertz wants that process done by Easter [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=867.86s)]
*  So it'll take you know several weeks at least the most interesting though and surprising result of the night was probably the [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=871.02s)]
*  Leftist delinquent party which a month ago seemed like they were not going to get the 5% [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=878.14s)]
*  Share of the vote they needed to be represented in the Bundestag [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=882.82s)]
*  But they ended up with nearly 9% of the vote they had a huge surge of support at the end [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=885.54s)]
*  after this charismatic young woman leader named Heidi [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=890.42s)]
*  Reckonesh gave a speech denouncing Mertz for putting forward this hardline immigration measure at the Bundestag that [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=894.56s)]
*  Passed with a bunch of support from the AFD [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=900.84s)]
*  Ben just big picture. What are your thoughts on this result and kind of what it tells us? First of all [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=903.4399999999999s)]
*  I know you have become like a very [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=908.48s)]
*  enthusiastic observer of German politics. Did you watch the post-election tradition where they have all the leaders on television? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=912.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's the coolest. Yeah, it's cool. Like it's so foreign to me as an American [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=919.16s)]
*  See them all like up there talking so like the night of the election like every leader of the party is like in a joint [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=923.24s)]
*  Interview. It's totally wild. I love it. You know, it's funny the reason I saw that I kept thinking those were clips from a debate [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=928.32s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, because I was like, why the fuck are they all together? It's a night. It's crazy. I I loved it [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=936.04s)]
*  I didn't know that either. I I was I was totally nerding out on on the election result itself. Look, it's bad [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=940.92s)]
*  The AFD did well. I mean I saw some people on you know [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=948.28s)]
*  Social media like being like, oh look they failed nobody thought they're gonna win, right, but they got about 20% which is about [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=953.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's a fifth of the population. That's bad. And it's about where they've been pulling the good news is [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=960.64s)]
*  The JD Vance Elon Musk interventions did nothing to help them, you know [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=966.6800000000001s)]
*  So they were pulling there before Elon started weighing and so it is a bit of a rebuke to those guys [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=970.48s)]
*  Because they were clearly trying to like pump up the AFD that didn't happen [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=977.6s)]
*  So that's one takeaway I think the second thing is now [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=981.88s)]
*  Mertz is victory this moves into the coalition formation and we'll just have to see if that goes [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=986.24s)]
*  Okay [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=990.58s)]
*  They did as we talked about last week moves so far right on immigration some other things that that might make it difficult [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=991.08s)]
*  But I think in the end you would expect that the threat of the AFD somehow getting into the government will compel [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=997.12s)]
*  God, I hope you know, I hope so because you know, hopefully Mertz moves a little bit too to make that easier to happen [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1003.6s)]
*  It's not like he has a massive mandate. He had under 30% of the vote [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1009.64s)]
*  the only other things that sent out to me this left wing surge is [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1013.6s)]
*  good and [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1018.28s)]
*  And notably actually the Libertarian Party that blew up the coalition didn't even make it to 5% [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1019.8000000000001s)]
*  So, you know nice well played there guys. Peace [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1025.2s)]
*  I will say like she proves that maybe [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1028.3600000000001s)]
*  standing up on principle like attracts some people your way because they got the late-breaking vote and [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1032.04s)]
*  Message to people it's not this is not even like a left center thing [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1037.24s)]
*  It's just like speaking with some conviction appeals to people and I'm glad she's gonna clearly be a voice and maybe she can be [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1040.8s)]
*  the [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1047.64s)]
*  Oppositionists who can gather some intensity so it's not just a of D [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1048.72s)]
*  So what you don't want is that there's a big coalition government and all the energy of opposition goes to the right, right? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1052.3600000000001s)]
*  Maybe she can capture some of that on the left. That'd be good [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1057.68s)]
*  The last thing we should talk about those at Mertz in that interview said some pretty radical things [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1060.24s)]
*  Right. I mean like we have a clip of that. Okay, so let's go to that [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1065.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so just a little set up a little bit. I mean Mertz is an interesting character [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1069.04s)]
*  He has been in and out of politics for decades [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1071.6799999999998s)]
*  He was in the European Parliament served in the Bundestag for about 15 years then left politics in 2009 to go make a shit ton [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1073.8s)]
*  Of money in corporate law and business [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1080.4399999999998s)]
*  He and Merkel Angela Merkel the former chancellor were [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1082.76s)]
*  Political rivals which for a very long time was not a good thing for him because she was like, you know [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1086.1999999999998s)]
*  All-consuming political figure he describes himself as socially conservative economically liberal [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1092.7199999999998s)]
*  He's a big supporter of the transatlantic alliance with the US [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1097.6399999999999s)]
*  Which is what made these election night comments by Merck's so surprising. Here's a clip [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1102.7199999999998s)]
*  It's clear that the Americans at least this part of the American government are largely indifferent to Europe's fate [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1107.7199999999998s)]
*  I am very curious about how we will approach the NATO summit at the end of June [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1113.9399999999998s)]
*  head towards June [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1119.82s)]
*  Whether we will still be talking about NATO in its current state or if we need to establish independent European defense [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1121.56s)]
*  Capabilities much more quickly. So that has absolute priority for me and I have absolutely no illusions about what is happening from America [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1128.52s)]
*  Look at what mr. Elon Musk has done recently in terms of interventions in the German elections [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1137.08s)]
*  That is an unprecedented event [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1143.44s)]
*  So the interventions from Washington were no less dramatic and [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1145.92s)]
*  Drastic and ultimately brazen than the interventions we had from Moscow still seen so [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1150.0800000000002s)]
*  We are under such massive pressure from two sides [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1156.68s)]
*  That my absolute priority now truly is to establish unity in Europe [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1159.68s)]
*  So then yeah in the first term Trump's first term, I think Europe took kind of like a wait-and-see approach [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1163.44s)]
*  I don't know if that's because they were just you know [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1168.18s)]
*  Biding their time or because you know, like the Committee to Save America the Jim Mattis is of the world [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1170.16s)]
*  We're kind of whispering reassurances to them at the sidelines of the conference now they are just moving on [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1173.92s)]
*  Yeah, well, I thought that was an absolutely astonishing [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1178.88s)]
*  You know, albeit maybe not surprising statement from him. First of all, this is a right-wing guy [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1182.68s)]
*  I mean right wing for the CDU [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1188.46s)]
*  and [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1190.88s)]
*  This is not a guy that seems enthusiastic about Elon Musk [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1192.24s)]
*  No, you know side note [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1195.16s)]
*  I hate that this guy who's a white South African guys like the American that every talking about [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1196.92s)]
*  Put that aside. Would you see Tesla share Tesla's down 8% today because they had really weak [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1202.96s)]
*  Sales in Europe in part because of this bullshit. Yeah, of course, but he you know, he's he this is not a victory for Trump, right? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1208.1200000000001s)]
*  Trump's party there is a FD the Republican Party's sister party in Germany is the a FD. Let's be clear about that [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1215.68s)]
*  So it's interesting me that even a kind of right-wing center-right politician in Europe is like, you know, stay the fuck out [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1222.52s)]
*  I mean to compare Elon Musk to Russia interfering in German politics is a pretty powerful statement [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1228.68s)]
*  And I think what this suggests is there is going to be a rapid realignment in Europe now that how that plays out [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1233.92s)]
*  We don't know but he was indicating essentially that Europe needs its own defense capabilities [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1240.0400000000002s)]
*  But in a meaningful way, you know, he was talking almost about like nuclear issues [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1245.48s)]
*  It you know, Germany is obviously not a nuclear weapons power [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1250.0200000000002s)]
*  But Britain and France are maybe some collective security arrangement could be made where they're not relying on the American nuclear security umbrella [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1252.6799999999998s)]
*  That's become a big conversation. That's a huge conversation and it would totally change [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1259.6399999999999s)]
*  Geopolitics if essentially Europe says we are not going to depend on the United States to be our security guarantee [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1264.7199999999998s)]
*  We're gonna be our own security guarantee [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1270.1599999999999s)]
*  That's gonna ultimately mean that not only do they have a stronger defense capability and they're talking about plussing up defense spending across the [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1272.04s)]
*  Continent but they're gonna have their own views on geopolitics on whether it's Ukraine [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1279.68s)]
*  But it could be other issues as well [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1284.08s)]
*  And so I think you should take Mertz's signal as hey, I'm actually not gonna get into bed with these AFD guys [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1285.44s)]
*  I want to pull together a German center albeit in the rightward direction [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1291.46s)]
*  That is also part of a European response to Trump and Putin and have a kind of a third way here in Europe [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1296.48s)]
*  Which is a pretty rational thing, but it's an indication of how fast the tectonic plates are moving underneath the globe [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1301.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think the biggest, you know challenge obviously the biggest challenge for Mertz going forward [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1308.0s)]
*  It's gonna be economic growth Germany's kind of stagnated over the last several years [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1313.24s)]
*  People are pissed energy costs went up in part because of the Russian invasion [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1317.2s)]
*  They also have to figure out an immigration policy that can defang the AFD in the right wing and make people feel heard [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1320.92s)]
*  Without emulating them or as you said earlier [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1329.0s)]
*  Alienating parts of the Social Democratic Coalition in a way that fractures the government and like coalition governments are great in so far as they [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1332.2s)]
*  Force you to work together with other parties and they force sort of a more moderate government [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1339.88s)]
*  But that clearly has allowed these populist movements to thrive and grow on both sides [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1346.1200000000001s)]
*  So we'll see if that if they can sort of you know deal with that and mitigate that risk [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1351.8400000000001s)]
*  I'm a little worried with Mertz because he hasn't seemed to be the most deft political operator so far like this move in the [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1357.8s)]
*  Bundesag with the immigration proposal that got the AFD support that was seen as breaking the firewall was very stupid and [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1363.52s)]
*  Seemingly led to the rise of this far-left party. Yeah, and he is his vote sure seem to suffer because of it [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1369.88s)]
*  Yeah, definitely, but you know it look we're not seeing a we're not seeing a CDU AFD government. So that's nice [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1374.96s)]
*  No, that's that is nice [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1381.76s)]
*  And I mean I think the challenge immigration again is it's not that new the Social Democrats are super pro immigration these days [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1383.6799999999998s)]
*  There's very little that in Germany. It's whether or not immigration policy can remain consistent with EU law essentially [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1389.52s)]
*  You know, I think that's that that's a tricky thing is to manage and also you talked about growth like guess what's helpful to growth [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1396.08s)]
*  Immigration, you know [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1402.44s)]
*  So if you just go like totally shut the doors like, you know [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1403.32s)]
*  You have aging populations in Europe like how are you gonna get growth? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1406.56s)]
*  One thing we do know though is we've got you know, barring something strange happening the Trump term [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1409.32s)]
*  You're gonna have Mertz in Germany [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1414.56s)]
*  You're gonna have starmer in the UK because his mandate runs that far you grab McCrone for the next you know, two years [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1415.8s)]
*  Two years seven and so we kind of know the players [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1421.4799999999998s)]
*  Good actually hopefully we'll have a Democratic House at least by the time McCrone's gone. So you kind of know, okay [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1424.4399999999998s)]
*  It's Mertz starmer McCrone. That's that's not bad lineup [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1429.4799999999998s)]
*  It's you know, and it runs again it from center-left to center-right and McCrone [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1433.3999999999999s)]
*  Uber centrist, you know [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1438.04s)]
*  So that's what that's what we're dealing with and obviously Maloney and plenty of other leaders will be heard from as well [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1440.08s)]
*  Yeah decent leaders. I do I just keep seeing these elections that the youngest people are just saying absolutely not to the established parties [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1444.28s)]
*  Like 18 to 24 year olds or the the share of 18 to 24 year olds voting from the AFD skyrocketed [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1452.52s)]
*  Yeah, the share of 18 to 24 year olds voting for the far-left party skyrocketed [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1458.4s)]
*  So there's just not a lot of faith in institutions and traditional parties and look [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1462.22s)]
*  I'm not mocking. I kind of get it right and imagine again 18 [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1466.6s)]
*  you just went through kovat and like it's horrible economic crisis and inflation things are pretty awful, but [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1470.12s)]
*  We'll see it's a tough tough political challenge. No, I I think the lesson for the center-left to the left is [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1476.08s)]
*  Is how do you put yourself back on the side of younger people? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1482.1599999999999s)]
*  It's the same thing we're dealing with in this country and it's not some shortcut like we need a German Joe Rogan or something [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1485.3999999999999s)]
*  You need new messages new leaders new media strategies like they they're in the same boat as we all yeah [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1491.3600000000001s)]
*  the the you know young leader in the [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1498.0s)]
*  Delinka left party she blew up on tik-tok. Yeah, that's how they're slow and she's super compelling and cool tats [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1500.6000000000001s)]
*  You know, yeah for sure potty of the world is brought to you by Sunday's [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1506.2s)]

*  Sundays was co-founded by dr. Tori Waxman a practicing veterinarian who tests and formulates every version of each recipe [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1514.2399999999998s)]

*  Suggested FBI actually planned and incited January 6 [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1706.24s)]
*  He's been accused of lying and gross incompetence in past government jobs [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1709.4399999999998s)]
*  We go on forever about him, but for that reason his lack of experience [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1713.28s)]
*  That is Patel was expected to choose a career FBI agent to be his deputy in fact that role is always filled by a career person [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1717.76s)]
*  Someone who understands how the building works that brings institutional memory and operational know-how to the job [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1725.36s)]
*  According to the Wall Street Journal cash Patel promised US senators that he would name a career agent to be his deputy [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1732.24s)]
*  So of course that did not happen [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1737.4s)]
*  Instead the new deputy FBI director is a guy named Dan Bongino, and he will not have to be Senate confirmed [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1739.56s)]
*  Dan was a New York City cop turned Secret Service agent who then quit and [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1745.72s)]
*  Unsuccessfully ran for office a bunch of times [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1751.64s)]
*  He then pivoted to media hosting a show on Fox News and then a very successful podcast [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1754.04s)]
*  That was primarily about how great Donald Trump is [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1758.48s)]
*  And how awful people like you and me are hates us [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1762.36s)]
*  Then actively hates our guts. Yeah, and anyone who came across Dan Bongino on Twitter knows that he has like crazy [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1765.4399999999998s)]
*  Like calls people comedy commies and motherfuckers and this and that and [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1774.1599999999999s)]
*  In addition to you know sort of these temperamental challenges. I would say then [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1779.8799999999999s)]
*  This is a clip of how he talks about the FBI on his show this one's from 2022 the FBI has lost [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1785.84s)]
*  It's broken [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1793.4399999999998s)]
*  Irredeemably corrupt at this point the inexcusable raid on President Trump's home was a straw that broke the camel's back [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1795.1999999999998s)]
*  I mean it when I say it it's way past time to clean this FBI house up [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1801.78s)]
*  They have burned every last shred of faith and trust [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1806.8799999999999s)]
*  Freedom-loving Americans hadn't it and to the libs out there. Listen, don't even waste your time lecturing me on this issue [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1811.64s)]
*  Not a second. I get you right off. I pay no attention to you losers [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1818.16s)]
*  Okay, no one's been a stauncher defender of FBI agents [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1822.48s)]
*  I work with then me go back and listen to my shows you dipwads. I was the one defending them all the time [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1825.6000000000001s)]
*  I've actually been a federal agent a cop who actually put my butt on the line [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1831.5600000000002s)]
*  But what the FBI did to Donald Trump that wasn't law enforcement. It was tyranny [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1835.0s)]
*  So this one is so bad that you almost have to laugh [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1840.38s)]
*  But it also seems like a genuine inflection point [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1845.46s)]
*  Yeah [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1848.8200000000002s)]
*  Where I mean not only we learning the competence is just not a factor in these selections [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1849.3000000000002s)]
*  It is 100% about political loyalty and when you play that out as to what it could mean in a crisis or with [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1854.1000000000001s)]
*  Just a leader of bad faith like Donald Trump. It's pretty scary [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1861.7s)]
*  Yes, it is Tommy. I have my [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1866.1000000000001s)]
*  Pots a the world mug full of diet cookie [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1869.38s)]
*  we may need a second pot say the world and Trump yours that is after hours with like I'm in stronger stuff because [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1871.0600000000002s)]
*  listeners of this podcast world does that there know like we were pretty on the nose on some of these people like we've been [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1878.3000000000002s)]
*  monitoring the [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1883.3000000000002s)]
*  Cache-patelle situation for years. I did not have this one [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1884.7800000000002s)]
*  Game down. This is a real wild card. I did not think Dan Bongino. I thought maybe he'd like get access to Trump [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1889.0200000000002s)]
*  You know as deputy director the FBI it's an it's a wild development [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1895.04s)]
*  And he was voted for Secret Service head and that I was like that freaked me out [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1899.64s)]
*  But I was like, okay, I mean at least he's done the job as a job. I mean, it's not you know, but yes and [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1902.56s)]
*  Because first of all, I mean you made this comment in our text read and also on PSA [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1909.36s)]
*  But this is like a pretty rapid [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1913.66s)]
*  I don't know what else an American slide autocracy would look like other than what we've seen and if you look across the board [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1915.92s)]
*  Patel Bongino [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1921.92s)]
*  Pam bondi [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1924.04s)]
*  Pete Hegseth, you know Tulsi Gabbard like this is what it looks like. This is a bunch of [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1925.44s)]
*  total loyalists including you know [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1930.52s)]
*  Some unhinged personalities in the most powerful positions in government and just to get a little deeper into this deputy of that [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1932.64s)]
*  director the FBI role this person is [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1939.0s)]
*  Basically in charge of managing, you know, not just kind of the the vast enterprise of the FBI [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1943.2s)]
*  Incredibly sensitive investigations operational detail. Yeah, like debt like approving very sensitive [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1949.74s)]
*  law enforcement [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1955.6200000000001s)]
*  Decisions, you know to go after certain targets or to not go after other targets this person [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1957.18s)]
*  Negotiates agreements. I when I would interface with the deputy director the FBI was often Shawn Joyce. Yeah, yeah [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1962.98s)]
*  Greatest boss in X. I've ever heard and by the way, you know going out of limb not a Democrat [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1969.18s)]
*  I [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1974.5s)]
*  Don't put words in his mouth [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1975.66s)]
*  But like like these are not out of my mind repeating the refrain like the FBI [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1976.78s)]
*  This idea that the libs love the FBI that like wiretap Martin Luther King and you know [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1980.58s)]
*  This is this is this is crazy, right? [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1985.38s)]
*  And so he's gonna be involved in negotiations foreign governments [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1987.86s)]
*  We talked on this program about like the deputies committee meeting [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1991.06s)]
*  That's like the situation room meetings on sensitive matters [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1994.7s)]
*  The deputy FBI director would be there if it was a kind of counterterrorism issue [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=1998.22s)]
*  It was anything with an international dimension, so this is not a job where I don't know he can like [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2002.06s)]
*  Be a public figure. This is a management job and [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2009.9s)]
*  Management not just of like a bunch of thousands of FBI agents and it's sensitive investigations. It's foreign governments [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2013.98s)]
*  It's the interagency process of the United States government. I don't even know what it looks like to have Dan Bongino in those literally [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2019.26s)]
*  No, what does it look like? [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2026.38s)]
*  Imagine rolling up in the situation room or flying to a foreign country to negotiate an information sharing agreement or [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2027.78s)]
*  You know deciding whether or not to authorize [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2035.3s)]
*  Going after a law enforcement target like this is [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2038.6200000000001s)]
*  Like Dan Bongino is definitely 100% one of those guys who would attack me [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2042.38s)]
*  It would call me a van driver and say therefore I wasn't qualified. I'm a fiction writer [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2046.9s)]
*  Right with it. We were a writer van driver [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2050.9s)]
*  We weren't qualified to be like a spokesman or a speechwriter in the administration [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2052.8s)]
*  Because I don't know we hadn't worked in the government for 30 years [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2056.24s)]
*  And now this guy is coming out of the podcast studio to be deputy director of the FBI. I'm gonna read you a quote then [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2061.24s)]
*  This is a quote someone with no background as an agent would never be able to command the respect necessary to run the day-to-day [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2067.48s)]
*  operations of the bureau that is from Bill Barr [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2073.8799999999997s)]
*  Trump's attorney general at the end of his first term talking about cash Patel [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2078.16s)]
*  Yeah, because remember Trump tried to install cash Patel as the deputy director of the FBI bars and bill Barr was like over my dead [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2083.2s)]
*  fucking body [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2089.8799999999997s)]
*  Dan Bongino it also it just suggests to I mean because this I don't know if this was cash Patel's idea or Donald Trump's idea [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2092.0s)]
*  But Pam Bondi clearly doesn't care right? She's you know, like and and you know that cash Patel [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2100.24s)]
*  That he works for Donald Trump and [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2108.2s)]
*  Donald Trump thought it was a cool idea to put Dan Bongino in this job [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2110.72s)]
*  Like he has to say yes, like there is no scenario in which cash Patel is gonna say to Donald Trump [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2113.72s)]
*  No, I can't do that for you, you know, but anything which every other FBI I can tell you, you know in the Obama years [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2120.24s)]
*  It was largely Bob Mueller and then it was God to help us Jim Comey [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2126.2s)]
*  Like they you know, they didn't take direction from Barack Obama it brought I think you ever talked to I remember one time [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2130.12s)]
*  and and I don't know the exact circumstance, but I'm gonna guess it was either like the Boston Marathon bombing or [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2136.62s)]
*  it was like the [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2143.7s)]
*  cartridge printing cartridge, you know that I'll kind of try to put a bomb in a printing cartridge and [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2145.8199999999997s)]
*  Obama [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2151.94s)]
*  Suggested to me like we needed someone to like talk about this on television and maybe could I ask if like, you know [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2153.7s)]
*  Bob Mueller or whoever the FBI directors I was like I [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2161.62s)]
*  Think I raised it delicately like hey would the director be what and they're the fact of the White House even [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2165.9s)]
*  Broaching anything it's as anodyne as a television review. It would you would have thought I just like, you know [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2171.86s)]
*  Torn a copy of the Constitution [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2179.3s)]
*  Meanwhile these guys are like [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2183.1000000000004s)]
*  You know Donald Trump when somebody investigated they're gonna be investigated if Donald Trump's when somebody harassed [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2185.1000000000004s)]
*  They're gonna be harassed and as we've talked about before [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2189.0600000000004s)]
*  Even if they don't have the goods to put someone in prison they can ruin somebody's lives with legal fees [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2191.38s)]
*  They can you know cripple like a business they they can also look the other way at massive amounts of corruption [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2195.86s)]
*  By what they choose not to invest [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2201.82s)]
*  Yeah, they can look the other way and if they look hard enough at you [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2203.2599999999998s)]
*  They're gonna find something that they can prosecute you on and look that this comes also as we saw a [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2205.5s)]
*  Purge at the Pentagon last week that gets us into some similar territory [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2212.42s)]
*  So Trump fired CQ Brown the chairman of the Joint Chiefs [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2216.2999999999997s)]
*  He also fired the head of the Navy the number two at the Air Force and the top lawyers of the Army Navy and Air Force [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2220.26s)]
*  So CQ Brown the now former chairman of the Joint Chiefs was only the second black chairman in history [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2225.9s)]
*  He was fired because he is black. Let's just say what happened here [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2231.78s)]
*  Pete Hexeth made clear in his book that he questioned whether Brown had only been promoted in the first place because of his race [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2236.3s)]
*  He later did a podcast interview where he accused he said anyone involved in quote DEI woke shit [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2243.46s)]
*  has to be fired [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2249.94s)]
*  And again in the case of CQ Brown [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2251.74s)]
*  The quote unquote DEI woke shit was CQ Brown talking about being a black man in America after George Floyd was killed [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2254.06s)]
*  That was what happened [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2260.3799999999997s)]
*  The person the former now former chief of Navy operations Lisa Franchetti who was fired [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2261.7799999999997s)]
*  She was the first woman to hold the job [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2267.18s)]
*  So, of course she got the axe and then the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs Ben is gonna be lieutenant general Dan Cain [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2269.06s)]
*  He is a now retired Air Force pilot that Trump always talks about meeting in Iraq the apocryphal tales that [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2276.58s)]
*  Raising Cain said to him that he could defeat ISIS in a week when all his other advisors said he would take two years to [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2282.86s)]
*  Defeat them and raisin Cain was right [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2288.96s)]
*  But Cain doesn't actually meet the statutory story requirements for the job because he's a three-star not a four-star [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2291.2s)]
*  But Trump can give him a waiver. So Ben, I don't know anything about [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2296.84s)]
*  Dan Cain and I'm not trying to like denigrate us like maybe he's a brilliant military mind [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2300.2200000000003s)]
*  But what you're seeing a DOD feel similar to the FBI in so far as you have a secretary of defense [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2306.06s)]
*  Who is not remotely qualified for the job, right? He was a Fox News Weekend anchor [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2312.1400000000003s)]
*  He now owes all of his loyalty for his entire career is owed to Trump [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2316.1s)]
*  You have a chairman who was retired in working in venture capital and now has been brought back [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2320.7400000000002s)]
*  To be the chairman of the Joint Chiefs and he would not have gotten that job if not for [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2326.82s)]
*  Some sort of conversation where there was a perceived loyalty to Trump [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2331.2200000000003s)]
*  You listen to Trump tell the story about meeting raisin Cain in Iraq [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2334.48s)]
*  He like put on a MAGA hat afterwards and it's just it's it's all these people that oh [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2337.38s)]
*  Look, they have no independent [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2343.44s)]
*  Kind of resume or power structure or reason to be there except for Donald Trump [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2346.16s)]
*  And that's just not always the case like Mike Mullen the chairman of the Joint Chiefs in the beginning of Obama's first term [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2351.54s)]
*  Was a holdover from Bush like often. These are people that get held over [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2357.48s)]
*  Through administrations because you want some continuity [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2362.26s)]
*  Do you want to make the case that the the military is a political? [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2364.7400000000002s)]
*  But that has just been obliterated and now they're all just loyal to Trump. Yeah, I mean, I think there's [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2369.46s)]
*  First of all, we should talk about what happened to see you Brown and and and let's just say [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2374.98s)]
*  the Republican Party has [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2380.58s)]
*  tried to dine out on [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2383.46s)]
*  Pans to the US military [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2385.86s)]
*  For my entire life in politics and they're completely full of shit because if you refuse to stand up for CQ Brown [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2388.34s)]
*  You were refusing to stand up for the US military and how it operates and the idea that just because he is black and [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2396.14s)]
*  Happens to have spoken eloquently about it once in a video [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2402.86s)]
*  Disqualifies him from serving is a insult to every member of the US military. Obviously, it's principally an insult to the [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2407.26s)]
*  Many many many black and brown enlisted people that fight in this nation's wars that [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2415.22s)]
*  Carry out dangerous missions that people like Donald Trump and you would never go on right? [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2422.06s)]
*  But spare me the tributes in the platitudes in the pablum about the US military [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2428.14s)]
*  If you're willing to run a bus over CQ Brown on behalf of Pete Hegseth and Donald Trump and their so-called anti woke agenda [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2433.34s)]
*  Just sit out the next you know [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2440.98s)]
*  Fucking veterans and Memorial Day speeches about the US military because you just insulted every member of the United States military [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2443.58s)]
*  Not just the black and brown people the white people that serve alongside them. How are you gonna have cohesion? [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2449.42s)]
*  Pete you pdx and they like to say diversity is not a strength [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2455.18s)]
*  How you have cohesion in the force when you're just sending a message that some people are less valuable than other people in the military [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2457.7s)]
*  Yeah, you're black or your woman you're out [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2463.5s)]
*  Guess what when you're in the fucking foxhole or whatever metaphor you want to use [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2464.94s)]
*  It doesn't really matter what color you are and in you need to care as much about the person next to you [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2467.9s)]
*  Whether they're a woman or whether they're black or they're brown or whatever the hell they are, you know [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2472.46s)]
*  So I I wish there had been more outrage about this [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2476.5s)]
*  I know, you know, cuz this is not gonna happen on this never happens that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs always rolls over [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2479.7s)]
*  It's it's not like you come in and you pick your own person [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2485.1s)]
*  It's this worrisome thing. The FBI is worrisome enough [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2488.58s)]
*  I mean there they focused on the most powerful parts of government, you know law enforcement and [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2491.66s)]
*  Violence the military this is the most powerful [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2497.34s)]
*  Institution in the world the United States military [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2500.6600000000003s)]
*  It is three million people and to just turn it over and to try to turn it into some MAGA militia [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2502.5s)]
*  You know governed by Pete Hegseth is really dangerous and something that people have to watch closely [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2508.98s)]
*  I do think on the Dan Cain piece of this [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2513.98s)]
*  You remember when Trump like insisted on calling Jim Mattis mad dog [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2518.3s)]
*  He's like that's not my name [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2522.38s)]
*  Like I don't like that I I don't I don't know Dan Cain like likes to go by raisin Cain [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2525.02s)]
*  Trump's got this weird thing like he wants a general with a nickname and kind of central casting, you know, so we'll see [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2530.38s)]
*  But what worries me the most about this is is Pete Hegseth actually is this is the guy that is really in charge and [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2536.9s)]
*  You know, I I just I I don't know [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2543.38s)]
*  I hope that the military can be insulated by some degree from political interference [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2546.06s)]
*  We'll have to see yeah, I mean I agree with you Pete Hegseth is a clown [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2551.62s)]
*  He shouldn't have the job the chairman of Joint Chiefs. It shows to be the principal military adviser to the president [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2555.18s)]
*  I mean you you would you would think you would want the most experienced person you could possibly find in that job [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2560.9s)]
*  Therefore you would want them to be a four-star and maybe a combatant commander or someone who was a service chief [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2566.62s)]
*  Dan Cain is not that he also sort of a weird resume [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2571.74s)]
*  But he retired as a three-star but he did this liaison job to the CIA that was sort of confused [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2574.12s)]
*  Like an odd resume it's an odd resume. I mean what I found interesting about it though is like for the last several years [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2578.66s)]
*  He worked for our man Bill Burns, you know [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2584.44s)]
*  So not exactly, you know, you know, like so it's it's confusing [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2588.54s)]
*  it's the kind of resume that like I I had a I [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2594.1s)]
*  Had a couple people that worked for me Tommy and in our you know, little unit of the NSC, right? [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2597.98s)]
*  I remember there was one guy that it was after you left [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2602.7s)]
*  He came to work on on kind of that some of that global information space and he had like a 15-year gap in his resume [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2605.22s)]
*  it was like he signed up to serve and [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2612.62s)]
*  At the end and then like the next year before like point being is that he was up to some, you know [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2616.02s)]
*  Special forces type stuff. I'm sure and and there's a little bit of that in the Dan Cain [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2621.62s)]
*  But we don't know what what was you know what it was that's exactly right [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2628.62s)]
*  You could argue on the merits if the process wasn't so weird you could argue that a hybrid kind of military like CIA background [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2631.82s)]
*  actually, it's kind of a [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2638.02s)]
*  An accurate reflection of the way the US does, you know military operations around the world these days [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2639.54s)]
*  But it just happens in such as fucked up. Yeah strange hackish way that I don't trust it [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2645.2200000000003s)]
*  Well, here's the other thing the reason they have those requirements about being a four-star [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2650.5800000000004s)]
*  And is that they want you to have been like a service chief like usually the Joint Chiefs had run the Air Force the Navy [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2654.1800000000003s)]
*  the army [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2659.42s)]
*  Because it's not just military advisor on like policy [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2660.82s)]
*  It's also like managing the workforce managing all these personnel knowing how procurement is working, right? [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2664.38s)]
*  and so that's what's missing from Dan Cain's resume is being in this position of kind of overseeing an entire force and [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2670.7000000000003s)]
*  You know, so who's but that may be because Pete Hegseth thinks it is like woke [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2678.46s)]
*  Books or anti woke books qualify. There's actually nobody that means that has experience [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2683.54s)]
*  You know like managing this huge enterprise [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2688.96s)]
*  Of millions of people right now see you around it. He was an Air Force service chief [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2692.7999999999997s)]
*  He was deputy centcom and now he's gone [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2696.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, because he gave a speech once about being black in America for five minutes by the way, everybody should watch that speech [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2697.94s)]
*  Very good. It's really powerful. All right, Ben. We also wanted to check in on [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2702.6s)]
*  There's like flurry of immigration news happening every day and trying to follow it beyond just the day's headlines [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2706.48s)]
*  I think it's important. So last week we saw this report [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2712.68s)]
*  The Venezuelan migrants flown from Guantanamo to Venezuela [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2716.3199999999997s)]
*  The Washington Post had a story documenting the horrific conditions on the ground at this Gitmo camp that we've talked about in the past [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2721.8799999999997s)]
*  Where the Trump people say they're gonna house up to 30,000 migrants [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2728.2s)]
*  The conditions we're talking about include solitary confinement people getting strip searched [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2732.3199999999997s)]
*  people being shackled and caged when they're allowed outside and [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2736.7599999999998s)]
*  Despite the administration's claim that everyone getting sent to Gitmo were the worst of the worst their violent criminals their gang members their murderers [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2740.52s)]
*  That's just not true. CNN reported that 51 of the 177 had no criminal record at all [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2748.7599999999998s)]
*  And then separately the New York Times had this devastating piece and then you're the daily did a version of it [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2754.6s)]
*  That's worth listening to about a bunch of migrants that had been deported from the US and were sent to [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2760.3799999999997s)]
*  Panama these were people from all around the world [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2767.48s)]
*  There was a guy from China [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2769.92s)]
*  There was a person from Iran who had converted to Christianity [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2771.56s)]
*  Many of them were asylum seekers and they were all just shipped to Panama and then they got locked in these hotel rooms [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2775.64s)]
*  They didn't know what was going on. They were they couldn't contact anyone. There was people killing themselves like absolutely awful [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2781.68s)]
*  And basically what happened was they were offered [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2788.04s)]
*  Some sort of opportunity to get repatriated to their home country or their country of origin [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2791.44s)]
*  For many that is an impossibility these they would be killed or put in prison [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2795.3599999999997s)]
*  And so when they refused they were sent to this squalid camp by the edge of the jungle near the Darien Gap [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2799.04s)]
*  And so, you know Ben, I'm sure [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2805.3999999999996s)]
*  What's happening the optics of it some of the reporting I bet it is having a deterrent effect [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2809.48s)]
*  There are probably people who are like, oh my god, this is like inhuman. I don't want to go to the US now [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2813.56s)]
*  But more importantly, I think for us is that it's highlighting how [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2817.96s)]
*  Difficult this mass deportation effort is going to be because if the government knew where all the worst of the worst [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2823.2799999999997s)]
*  Violent undocumented offenders were they would already have been sent home, but they don't right? [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2830.16s)]
*  So what's happening is they're deporting fewer people than Trump wants. He's gonna start pushing them to do more [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2835.44s)]
*  They're picking up the wrong people innocent people often and they're doing it in like horrible conditions [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2840.56s)]
*  And I think tracking this is going to be pretty important because it's you know [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2845.8s)]
*  It's illegal in some cases inhumane in every case and just worth flagging. Yeah [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2849.4s)]
*  You know loathe to recommend another podcast [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2855.6400000000003s)]
*  It's not Dan Bongino, but the daily upset on this is really powerful and you know, you make a few important points first is [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2858.32s)]
*  You know, it's hard to [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2865.48s)]
*  Some countries won't take deportees back, right? [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2868.2400000000002s)]
*  So, you know, there are countries, you know [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2870.6s)]
*  Like Nicaragua or other countries in Central America that that aren't exactly like lining up to to take back people have been deported [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2872.84s)]
*  But it's so powerful about that segment though. It's people from China [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2880.4s)]
*  People this woman from Iran is a Christian and that's why she doesn't go back by the way, you know, what a bunch of it [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2883.96s)]
*  Where's Mike Pence? Yeah, where's the evangelical Christians in in the Republican Party that you know want to stand up for people like that? [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2889.48s)]
*  There's a human tragedy of just these people being deposited in the middle of nowhere in Panama [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2896.6s)]
*  We talked on this podcast several times about the Tory government wanting this scheme to send people back to Rwanda [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2901.92s)]
*  This is much much much worse [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2910.4s)]
*  Like as grotesque as that Rwanda plan was it was actually a plan [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2912.68s)]
*  It was like, you know sending them there and there's got this is it seems like they're just like dumping people off the plains in Panama [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2916.92s)]
*  And Panama so scared to say no because Trump might invade take the Panama Canal back [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2922.6s)]
*  But there's something more fundamental about this. This is not if you look at who these people are [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2927.72s)]
*  This is not like people, you know coming across the southern border [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2932.18s)]
*  Some of these people are people who have very credible cases for political asylum [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2936.0s)]
*  Like a Iranian Christian who's worried that she's gonna be killed or imprisoned for her religion [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2940.12s)]
*  Through all our ups and downs of immigration [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2945.7599999999998s)]
*  One thing that's been pretty constant the US has been a safe haven for people who have very credible fears of being killed or [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2947.8s)]
*  Imprisoned for their political religious beliefs [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2955.5600000000004s)]
*  We are changing something fundamental about our identity as a country if those are the kinds of people that we're sending to the jungle in Panama [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2958.8s)]
*  Yeah, you know, this is again not securing the border [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2965.28s)]
*  This is saying no to dissidents to political asylum seekers with very very credible claims and we are no longer that country [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2968.4s)]
*  That you know has been so beyond enriched, you know, so we got people like Einstein to come here [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2976.48s)]
*  You know like like by having people that had different political religious views from the places that they're from and I think we have to [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2981.4s)]
*  Track this too [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2988.96s)]
*  Like how are we changing as to who we are and it's certainly gonna change attitudes towards the United States [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2990.4s)]
*  And those people are gonna look to other places to go if they can find other places to go [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2994.96s)]
*  And and we're gonna lose a lot as a country in the long and for do you see that Eric Prince? [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=2998.7200000000003s)]
*  Do you see that Eric Prince the former head of Blackwater [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3004.08s)]
*  Which if you guys don't know is a private militia force that was accused of all kinds of atrocities in Iraq [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3008.08s)]
*  He has reportedly pitched the Trump administration on a 25 billion dollar plan to create a vigilante army [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3014.12s)]
*  To deport 12 million people people before the midterm so it could get worse [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3019.32s)]
*  Well, this is to go back to their banter about Nazi reading [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3023.8s)]
*  I mean one thing that's been missing is you know [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3027.52s)]
*  Hitler came to power in part with the support of the SA these brown shirts tens of thousands of Germans that terrorize his political opponents [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3029.96s)]
*  Be they communist or Jews or trade unionists? [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3037.96s)]
*  That's the one thing we didn't have yet [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3041.08s)]
*  I mean we did have proud boys and some kind of militia guys if we literally I'm not exaggerating. I mean [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3042.52s)]
*  Eric Prince's proposal is essentially creating some brown shirts, you know [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3048.64s)]
*  People roaming around American communities vigilantes empowered you might receive people [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3052.44s)]
*  Do you really trust those guys to like separate violent criminals from other people or no frankly separate? [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3056.82s)]
*  Someone who looks different who is a citizen of this country. There's a profit motive. Yeah, not at all [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3063.1800000000003s)]
*  They've quotas and the same, you know, you don't like it when BL quotas get parking tickets [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3068.26s)]
*  So these guys have quotas to deport people. It's not gonna be good. Yeah [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3073.1000000000004s)]
*  Terrible. Okay. We have a few more things to get through for the interview [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3077.38s)]
*  So the annual conservative political action conference or CPAC conference just wrapped up [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3080.5800000000004s)]
*  This thing used to be like kind of a right-wing fringe that we would all make fun of every year now [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3085.48s)]
*  It's just now runs a mega base [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3089.12s)]
*  Over the years CPAC has evolved to include more international speakers. They even hold conferences abroad [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3091.3999999999996s)]
*  Here's a quick supercut of some of the international voices at this year's CPAC [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3097.12s)]
*  Suddenly post-neverember the fifth America is [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3102.52s)]
*  Optimistic its upbeat. It's the beginning of the golden age in America [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3106.44s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, we missed the first American Revolution in [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3112.28s)]
*  1776 in fact, it was actually a revolution against us [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3117.7200000000003s)]
*  But we want to be part of the second American revolution. I envy so much your program drill baby drill [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3123.2400000000002s)]
*  We'll look for one in Europe Maga and mega [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3131.88s)]
*  these moments [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3136.48s)]
*  these moments are not [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3138.28s)]
*  Only simply slogans they represent a vision that resonates urgently not only in the United States [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3141.0s)]
*  But across the world when Bill Clinton and Tony Blair created the global leftist liberal network in the 90s [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3147.76s)]
*  They were called statesmen [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3155.2000000000003s)]
*  today when Trump [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3158.2000000000003s)]
*  Meloni Milay or maybe Modi talk they are called a threat to democracy [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3160.76s)]
*  Shout out to Michael our team for enduring all those speeches and cutting them down for you [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3171.0400000000004s)]
*  I think Michael secretly is entertaining. He loved it. Yeah, you laughing over there. That was form UK's Nigel Farage [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3175.28s)]
*  Former Tory Prime Minister Liz Truss who gosh she's such a dud every time I hear her talk [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3181.6800000000003s)]
*  The former Prime Minister of Poland whose name I'm not gonna try Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fito [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3185.44s)]
*  Italy's Georgia Maloney in Argentina's Javier Millay at the end there entertaining us [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3191.2400000000002s)]
*  Not in those clips but attending were Jair Bolsonaro's son the former president of Brazil [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3196.96s)]
*  And the leader of the far-right Spanish box party [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3203.1600000000003s)]
*  Millay not only gave a speech he hung out with Elon Musk handed him a chainsaw [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3205.88s)]
*  I was remember his thing at all these campaign events and then a weird kind of stone seeming Elon Musk hung out with the [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3209.4s)]
*  Chainsaw and wore glasses and tried I think it's advisable to not be on ketamine while you're operating [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3214.7200000000003s)]
*  The whole thing was off [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3219.36s)]
*  Notably absent from the proceedings was Jordan Bardella [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3221.4s)]
*  Who's the leader Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally Party? [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3224.2000000000003s)]
*  He canceled his appearance after Steve Bannon gave what I think every one of eyeballs [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3228.48s)]
*  Thought looked like a Nazi salute Bannon denied it said it was a wave like clearly [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3233.04s)]
*  He's trying to do that [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3237.76s)]
*  I'm just trolling thing and he had this to say to a French publication quote [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3238.84s)]
*  If he Bardella canceled the speech over what the mainstream media said about the speech [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3243.52s)]
*  He didn't listen to the speech if that's true. He's unworthy to lead France. He's a boy not a man [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3248.04s)]
*  Okay, Steve some tough talk [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3253.14s)]
*  I don't know then what do you make of this collection of goobers who spoke and what it tells us [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3255.14s)]
*  There's a lot of this usual suspects at this point [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3259.18s)]
*  it's the usual suspects part of what's so frustrating about this political moment is on the one hand I [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3261.14s)]
*  Have to acknowledge the very effective [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3266.22s)]
*  You know 10 year effort to construct this far-right international totally built and [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3269.98s)]
*  There needs to be one on the center left to the left there needs to be our version of CPAC [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3277.0600000000004s)]
*  We've needed it for a long time. I wrote a whole book about this global international [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3283.9s)]
*  But at the same time that I can see [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3290.1800000000003s)]
*  How they've been investing in shared platforms like this shared political strategies shared funding sources [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3293.1800000000003s)]
*  most of them are [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3300.86s)]
*  So fucking mediocre I know that it drives me crazy [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3302.86s)]
*  I like it so I can see like what's really smart about what they've done and yet [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3306.96s)]
*  You've got a bunch of goobers like Liz Truss and you know, melee like screaming at the top his lungs [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3311.7400000000002s)]
*  I will say Maloney's an astute politician [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3317.58s)]
*  And well first that was actually the the smartest clip, you know, hey [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3320.1800000000003s)]
*  Why can't we be you know, Bill Clinton Tony Boyle started global progress by the way, I go to global progress summits [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3324.02s)]
*  They're not quite what the energy is in that room, you know, like maybe we need some chainsaws at the progress summits [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3330.02s)]
*  but as much as we should laugh at this because it's an absurdity to it more importantly, we have to [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3337.14s)]
*  Reverse engineer it. I agree and have our own I agree [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3343.7000000000003s)]
*  Let's end this by talking about some news out of Gaza in the West Bank. So in terms of Gaza [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3346.86s)]
*  Ben last week we talked about this horrible tragic news about the B boss family [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3352.1s)]
*  Yarden be boss the patriarch of the family was returned in one of the recent hostage release deals [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3357.34s)]
*  He was one of the men who looked like a Holocaust survivor because he was so emaciated [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3363.02s)]
*  But you know, we officially learned around the same time that his wife and two small children had died while in Hamas captivity [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3368.34s)]
*  Last week Hamas was supposed to release the bodies of Sheree be boss Yarden's wife and their two children [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3375.26s)]
*  Four-year-old Ariel and nine-month-old Kefir but the Israeli authorities later determined that the body Hamas said was Sheree be bossed was someone else [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3381.78s)]
*  Hamas said there was a mix-up of some sort. They later returned the correct body, but it is hard to imagine [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3391.3s)]
*  Anything more cruel and evil and just its totality than the treatment of the B boss family [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3397.98s)]
*  From kidnapping them in the first place to kidnapping children to starving Yarden be boss to the point where you know [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3403.46s)]
*  He looked so emaciated to parading the coffins these children were in through the streets of Gaza and then returning the [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3409.34s)]
*  Wrong-bird like the words don't do justice for how fucking evil this was [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3417.38s)]
*  An Israeli military spokesman later said that the B boss boys were killed with bare hands quote unquote [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3421.46s)]
*  Hamas had claimed that the B boss family was killed in an airstrike. I don't know [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3428.94s)]
*  That we can prove either of those things [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3435.42s)]
*  I just want to say it's really awkward to talk about this because [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3437.42s)]
*  My view on this is I don't need to know how the B boss [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3440.62s)]
*  Children died to know that it was evil and wrong to kidnap children in the first place [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3444.34s)]
*  Like obviously if they were strangled to death by Hamas person that is like a next-level thing [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3449.34s)]
*  But like the fact that they were taken is just beyond cruel, but I just I want to reflect in our conversation that there is [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3453.04s)]
*  Debate and dispute over sort of what the forensic pathologists could know at this point, but all of that tension [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3460.94s)]
*  Brings us to Saturday when Hamas handed over the last living hostages that were part of this phase one of the ceasefire deal [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3467.02s)]
*  Israel is supposed to release 620 Palestinian prisoners [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3473.58s)]
*  But they put their release on hold in protest of the treatment of the B boss family these hostages [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3476.22s)]
*  Hamas also released this awful propaganda video of two hostages who were not set for release until phase two [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3482.54s)]
*  But they were brought to this ceremony and forced to watch others go free and then they were begging for their freedom [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3490.06s)]
*  So again, just unfathomable cruelty [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3495.94s)]
*  Hamas accused Israel of a blatant violation of the agreement for not releasing these [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3498.98s)]
*  620 prisoners and said there'd be no more ceasefire talks until they were let go a Hamas official [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3504.06s)]
*  Accused Netanyahu of intentionally sabotaging the ceasefire efforts [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3510.34s)]
*  So phase one of the ceasefire ends on Saturday the talks for the second phase haven't even started [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3513.94s)]
*  When asked about the ceasefire failing in the worst beginning again [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3520.06s)]
*  Trump told Fox's Brian kill me that he was basically okay with it going either way [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3524.2799999999997s)]
*  So Ben, I just wonder where you're at on your hope for this thing extending [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3528.48s)]
*  I've heard reports that Israeli authorities want to extend phase one rather than like negotiate to phase two [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3532.56s)]
*  Which it doesn't give me much confidence that the war is gonna stay over. I don't know where you're where you're at [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3539.88s)]
*  Yeah, they seem to not want to get to the more foundational issues [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3546.08s)]
*  You know about the future of Gaza where there's just these bigger gaps [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3551.2s)]
*  They've been better at being able to negotiate essentially prisoner exchanges because that's where we are now [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3555.52s)]
*  There's a ceasefire and then these prisoner exchanges Palestinians released and then hostages returned [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3560.48s)]
*  That's better than the alternative of kind of returned to where we were before [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3564.7599999999998s)]
*  But it does suggest that they can't really deal with these long-term questions. And so they may just try to get as many [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3569.3199999999997s)]
*  Exchanges done without right while kicking the drawing fully [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3576.76s)]
*  I will say like like this is a window into the fact that you know, the current iteration of a moss [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3580.26s)]
*  remains [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3585.88s)]
*  completely kind of nihilistic and lacking in any [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3587.08s)]
*  Capacity for empathy and you know not just in what was done to the bill bass family, but the way in which they've managed all this [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3592.08s)]
*  I I will also say Tommy like as you know [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3597.46s)]
*  Seeing the the [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3603.4s)]
*  Evaluation of human life in the Israeli response to the treatment of this family [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3605.56s)]
*  What about the tens of thousands of Palestinian children have been killed and and [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3612.8s)]
*  Like [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3618.8s)]
*  It's something kind of I just wish you could extend do both. Yeah [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3620.2400000000002s)]
*  I wish there could be empathy in both directions for children and civilians [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3624.56s)]
*  The only other things I flagged we have to come back to more time the West Bank [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3629.48s)]
*  You know is like looks like Israel's ratcheting up there but also Syria like Israel's doing a lot of shit in southern Syria [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3633.8799999999997s)]
*  Well, just to get a little more deep meat on that [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3639.96s)]
*  I mean Israeli tanks have entered the West Bank for the first time in over two decades [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3641.8799999999997s)]
*  This is this huge operation in Janine that is displaced about 40,000 people. Yeah, this is not small [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3644.92s)]
*  Yeah, so it's the biggest displacement in the West Bank since the 1967 war [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3650.8799999999997s)]
*  And Netanyahu was saying the IDF is gonna stay there as long as it needed and so further stoking the flames is there was this [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3655.56s)]
*  Attack there was like a three buses blew up in Tel Aviv [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3661.68s)]
*  No one died. Thank God [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3665.88s)]
*  But the one of the unexploded bombs had a message on it about that talked about revenge for a raid in the in the West Bank [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3667.06s)]
*  And then to your point, I mean this demand [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3673.52s)]
*  The Netanyahu is demanding the demilitarization of southern Syria [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3676.84s)]
*  There's the question about like whether the new Syrian army is welcome in this territory south of Damascus [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3681.48s)]
*  So there's a lot as you mentioned like it's a lot up in the air here [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3687.24s)]
*  And it's and we should spend more time in the series the thing we more time but like there's [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3689.72s)]
*  This is Syrian territory. It's like why is he's really? [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3695.24s)]
*  And nobody the Syrian government the new Syrian government has not said anything threatening Israel [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3698.7599999999998s)]
*  They've actually said they don't honor all these agreements [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3703.06s)]
*  I don't think anybody thinks that the Syrian military is like preparing to roll into to Israel [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3704.8999999999996s)]
*  In fact, they these are the people yes, they're Islamist, but they're I thought we didn't like Assad [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3709.52s)]
*  I thought he was part of the axis of resistance [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3714.24s)]
*  And the one thing I'd say just globally to bring this home is this is what I'm worried about with Trump is [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3716.3599999999997s)]
*  That the complete normalization, you know of borders don't matter [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=3722.3199999999997s)]

*  pump-and-dump implies crime and in the crypto world [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4024.44s)]
*  We've entered this like new era where you know, we can do sort of like crime light. It's not a pump-and-dump [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4028.68s)]
*  It's just like a rugpole. It's all in the game is sort of their attitude because on these like [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4034.4s)]
*  new cryptocurrencies [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4041.0s)]
*  The rugpole it's not even a question of like will there be a rugpole? [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4043.68s)]
*  It's almost like a game where you're just gambling on this cryptocurrency and [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4047.4s)]
*  Hoping that you'll sell out a profit before the inevitable crash, right? Right, right, right. Okay good [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4051.92s)]
*  This is very helpful because you're actually [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4058.04s)]
*  Anticipating one of the questions I have for you later. So but but back to this Libra coin [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4060.28s)]
*  86% of traders who bought Libra lost money total losses were something like two hundred and fifty one million dollars [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4065.28s)]
*  Just for our listeners who aren't familiar with crypto when we're talking about a meme coin [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4072.24s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4076.82s)]
*  Yeah, so the original idea with Bitcoin [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4078.32s)]
*  Which is now like 15 years old was that it would be some sort of alternative to the US dollar [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4082.36s)]
*  like it would be this decentralized digital money and we would use it for [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4088.94s)]
*  Everyday transactions and that totally has not come true. Nobody is using cryptocurrency [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4094.94s)]
*  for regular stuff [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4101.1s)]
*  But what has happened is there's been this proliferation of new cryptocurrencies and [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4102.9s)]
*  Some of them are like almost like stocks and startups [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4109.42s)]
*  some of them are still trying to be alternatives to real currencies and then [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4113.259999999999s)]
*  at the absolute dumbest end of the spectrum we have meme coins and [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4118.54s)]
*  these are [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4125.58s)]
*  the original meme coin was Doge coin and [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4127.299999999999s)]
*  This was it was created as a kind of parody of [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4131.700000000001s)]
*  The like Bitcoin and what the creator saw is like its get rich quick mentality. So they said hey [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4136.34s)]
*  We've got this new cryptocurrency [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4143.34s)]
*  It's represented by this picture of a dog. We're calling it Doge coin. It does absolutely nothing [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4146.06s)]
*  We are not saying it will ever do anything in the future. There's literally no way this could ever actually be worth money [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4153.580000000001s)]
*  Now, how would you like to buy some right and as it turned out a lot of people did buy some and people made [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4160.780000000001s)]
*  tons of money on Doge coin because this became kind of an online craze and [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4168.700000000001s)]
*  it turned it was similar to the [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4174.38s)]
*  GameStop and AMC phenomenons in during the [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4177.34s)]
*  pandemic when basically traders kind of [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4181.820000000001s)]
*  Went crazy and pumped up the value of these stocks like way beyond anything that could be justified by their real business and [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4185.1s)]
*  in crypto [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4193.5s)]
*  When you've got like a good story like Oh Doge coin people got rich on Doge coin very quickly [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4195.26s)]
*  There's copycats and in the last couple of years [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4201.18s)]
*  there have just been tons and tons of meme coins and [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4205.3s)]
*  some of them so all of them what distinguishes them from each other is [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4210.9800000000005s)]
*  a meme coin from other cryptocurrencies is that there is no [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4215.14s)]
*  Promise that it will ever do anything at best. This is like a zero-sum game where the early people [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4219.900000000001s)]
*  Might make money and the later people lose money. But in reality, it's a game that is generally [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4227.54s)]
*  rigged by the insiders and that money comes off the top and [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4235.26s)]
*  A lot of the gamblers think they're the smart ones who are gonna get in early and win the game but are in fact [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4240.660000000001s)]
*  The bag holders the ones who are getting dumped on by the insiders, right and that's like this happens again and again and [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4247.620000000001s)]
*  People just don't seem to learn their lesson. They just seem to sort of like this [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4256.06s)]
*  Meme coin game. Yeah. Well, we all keep going to the casino too, right? I mean I get it on some level [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4261.540000000001s)]
*  But so thank you for that very helpful explanation. So after this happens [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4267.38s)]
*  The rug gets pulled have your Malay pumps this cryptocurrency [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4271.46s)]
*  All these people lose money and they get hurt a bunch of his political opponents were calling for impeachments [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4275.0199999999995s)]
*  There was a judge who threatened to investigate him for fraud [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4281.0599999999995s)]
*  One of the guys behind this Libra coin said that he was paying off Malay's sister to get him to do things [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4283.9s)]
*  He is also associated with the Melania Trump meme coin launch. I believe [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4290.82s)]
*  Could you tell us just a little bit about Hayden Davis and like what does it mean to be like the guy who? [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4295.92s)]
*  Launched some shit coin or meme coin [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4302.400000000001s)]
*  And also, I mean, is it a coincidence that this same person is connected with Trump or Malay or does that suggest some sort of? [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4305.24s)]
*  connectivity between kind of right-wing figures in this crypto world [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4312.92s)]
*  So Hayden Davis, he's he's 28 years old until recently [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4316.76s)]
*  He was not like a big-name figure in crypto. It's actually kind of funny [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4322.68s)]
*  this Malay [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4329.240000000001s)]
*  meme coin got rugged so quickly and maybe the right people did not make money on it right that the [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4331.72s)]
*  crypto community [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4338.84s)]
*  is really up in arms and they're pointing fingers at Hayden Davis and [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4340.64s)]
*  What they're saying is like, you know all the stuff that we were doing that's not so bad [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4345.4800000000005s)]
*  Look at this guy, you know that coin dropped after like five minutes [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4350.72s)]
*  Like we at least had the decency to let our coin like run for a couple days before we rug pulled it [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4354.72s)]
*  So it appears and like the details of this were all just coming out now [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4360.52s)]
*  But it appears that he has been behind not just political meme coins [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4365.12s)]
*  But some other ones that don't involve celebrities maybe some that involve other [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4369.88s)]
*  minor celebrities [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4375.240000000001s)]
*  basically, it seems like [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4376.8s)]
*  Let's say you wanted to launch a meme coin you might not know exactly how to do it and [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4379.2s)]
*  You in asking around would eventually be told hey this guy Hayden has done many successful [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4387.4800000000005s)]
*  meme coins [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4394.96s)]
*  he's the guy to talk to he'll set you up with everything and [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4396.56s)]
*  No Hayden has said that [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4401.64s)]
*  he denies [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4406.6s)]
*  paying [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4408.8s)]
*  Mule or his sister [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4410.12s)]
*  And that he was doing this only to benefit [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4412.64s)]
*  Argentina's people and economy but there's been all sorts of [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4417.04s)]
*  Chatter about [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4424.400000000001s)]
*  Influencers getting special deals to [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4427.0s)]
*  Promote these meme coins to their followers. There's also [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4431.04s)]
*  on most of these meme coin launches [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4435.92s)]
*  People who follow crypto closely can see on the blockchain that there's certain anonymous wallets that are [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4439.8s)]
*  Getting in really early even maybe before [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4446.96s)]
*  the famous person sends the tweet promoting the meme coin and then dumping quickly for big profits and [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4450.08s)]
*  So a lot of people are looking for [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4456.12s)]
*  meme coin insider trading like how are these people getting tipped off? Are they are the people involved with creating the meme coin? [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4459.28s)]
*  conspiring with [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4467.400000000001s)]
*  other traders to make like extra profit off the [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4469.04s)]
*  Launch beyond just selling worthless made-up coins to the public for real money [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4473.08s)]
*  well [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4477.400000000001s)]
*  I guess I guess part of just to dig in a little deeper like if you're in [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4477.88s)]
*  If you're looking to IPO your company and you go to an investment bank [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4481.4400000000005s)]
*  They like do a lot of things for you, right? They take you on a roadshow [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4485.120000000001s)]
*  They do a bunch of marketing maybe some financing right? [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4488.200000000001s)]
*  Like there's a whole bunch of services provided that are real [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4491.04s)]
*  Does someone like Hayden Davis provide real services besides like he's done it before [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4493.8s)]
*  Yeah, like this isn't gonna go on the New York Stock Exchange [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4498.88s)]
*  But you still need to connect with like the crypto exchanges and figure out how to set up your liquidity pool now [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4502.4800000000005s)]
*  that said if [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4510.76s)]
*  You wanted to launch a meme coin. There is a website called pump dot fun [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4512.68s)]
*  Yeah, where you can do it in like 10 seconds [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4517.6s)]
*  Yes, and so if your goal is only to launch a meme coin for fun [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4520.36s)]
*  Just you do not need any help, right? But if you want to [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4526.84s)]
*  Control every aspect of it and maximize your profits [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4531.84s)]
*  You might want to talk to some weird crypto guy who's done it before and you know [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4535.08s)]
*  You heard made X million dollars for you know some C-list rapper [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4539.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4544.8s)]
*  Why go to pump that fun when you can find someone who will absolutely? [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4545.16s)]
*  Absolutely rat fuck you at the end of the day [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4547.96s)]
*  But along with something you said earlier there was this assumption early on that Bitcoin [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4550.56s)]
*  Was gonna be this thing that allowed criminals to move money around in ways that could not be traced [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4556.04s)]
*  But in reality the nature of the blockchain [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4561.2s)]
*  Made it so that there's all these on chain kind of detectives out there just on the internet who were able to track [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4564.56s)]
*  Crypto transactions in great detail by just looking at the public ledger in record [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4571.24s)]
*  Can you just give us a kind of like a bit of the 101 on that process and whether that kind of sleuthing [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4576.179999999999s)]
*  Could be applied by [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4581.78s)]
*  Someone like me who wants to know who was buying the Trump coin for example with cryptocurrency [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4583.98s)]
*  It's everyone has their own [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4590.219999999999s)]
*  Wallet address and these wallet addresses they don't have your name on it. You are represented by a [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4593.139999999999s)]
*  Thirty something string of random letters and numbers and if you don't tell anybody your wallet address [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4600.3s)]
*  Nobody's gonna know it and it would be very effective for you to hide your money or to send it around the world without anybody [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4606.9800000000005s)]
*  knowing where the detectives come in is that [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4613.78s)]
*  Once they do know that a wallet addresses of interest they can see every single transaction [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4618.02s)]
*  It's ever made with every other [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4623.860000000001s)]
*  Anonymous wallet address and so there are these [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4626.580000000001s)]
*  crypto research firms the best-known one is chain analysis that have built up these really big databases that [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4629.06s)]
*  connect [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4636.740000000001s)]
*  wallet addresses with [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4637.9800000000005s)]
*  people's identities and [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4640.9800000000005s)]
*  Again like your average person is not gonna end up in this database and probably still could use this for like anonymous crime, but [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4644.14s)]
*  Right just the other day a big crypto exchange called [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4651.820000000001s)]
*  Vibit was hacked for 1.5 billion dollars worth of ether and so immediately [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4656.06s)]
*  All of those wallet addresses that receive the hacked money [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4662.38s)]
*  It's like the die pack went off in the bag of stolen cash from the bank [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4665.9400000000005s)]
*  Like those are now dirty wallet addresses and if you try and send it to another wallet anonymous to clean it up [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4670.580000000001s)]
*  People can still see that it won't really work [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4676.740000000001s)]
*  So it's there are techniques that the criminals use to try to launder their dirty crypto [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4678.900000000001s)]
*  But once like your money is kind of identified as dirty crypto it becomes hard for you to spend it like you might remember [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4684.1s)]
*  Razzlecon the terrible rapping hacker. Yes [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4691.740000000001s)]
*  Tell us about them real quick. So [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4695.780000000001s)]
*  These guys they previously held the record for like biggest [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4698.700000000001s)]
*  Bitcoin exchange heist it was this it turned out it was this couple that lived in a financial district the woman went by [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4704.740000000001s)]
*  Razzlecon and she had actually recorded [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4712.360000000001s)]
*  Like epically terrible raps in which she talked about like her social engineering skills [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4715.64s)]
*  so [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4722.24s)]
*  They got caught there. I think awaiting [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4723.68s)]
*  prison right now [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4726.96s)]
*  but they [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4728.56s)]
*  They stole Bitcoin that at the time they were caught was worth like three or five billion dollars [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4730.16s)]
*  but they were only ever able to spend a tiny fraction of it because [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4737.12s)]
*  that like [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4741.96s)]
*  You know metaphorical die pack had gone off [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4743.08s)]
*  so in the case of like a [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4746.92s)]
*  Trump coin [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4749.320000000001s)]
*  Right now I'll give you an example [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4751.320000000001s)]
*  There's a wallet that acquired a million dollars of Trump coin [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4753.72s)]
*  possibly before he ever tweeted about it and so [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4759.4800000000005s)]
*  That person sold the Trump coin and made about a hundred and eighty million dollars in profit. Wow and [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4764.16s)]
*  For me and my colleagues did some digging on this even though you could see this on the blockchain [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4770.639999999999s)]
*  we weren't able to identify who this person was on a [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4777.639999999999s)]
*  researcher on Twitter who goes by bubble maps was able to track down through like the person had [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4783.12s)]
*  Transacted with some sort of known wallet at some point. They identified this trader as an anonymous person who goes by Nassim [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4791.04s)]
*  and [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4799.44s)]
*  Nassim claims he did not have inside information [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4801.6s)]
*  But we still don't know who Nassim is. So [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4805.48s)]
*  Like this crypto tracing only kind of goes so far [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4808.56s)]
*  Interesting man, you mentioned this this news that broke last week of this North Korean hack of [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4812.56s)]
*  And theft of 1.5 billion dollars for the crypto from this Dubai based crypto exchange [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4818.68s)]
*  In addition to this being just you know, a massive theft of digital assets [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4824.6s)]
*  They also somehow managed to steal from crypto wallets that are supposed to be the most secure, right? [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4829.36s)]
*  Can you just explain what was so shocking about this theft? The exchange [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4836.0s)]
*  Said that they had been holding this [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4841.84s)]
*  crypto and what's called a multi sig cold wallet and [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4846.28s)]
*  What this means is that it's a little like in the [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4851.08s)]
*  Movie when you need like three people's key to activate the nuclear missile these multi sig wallets [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4858.360000000001s)]
*  Will not you can't send crypto out of them unless two or more of the people who control the wallet [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4866.16s)]
*  successfully [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4875.28s)]
*  authenticate themselves [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4876.8s)]
*  You would think it would be very hard for hackers to [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4880.8s)]
*  Get that money out of there. Um, I don't think it's been revealed [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4884.92s)]
*  How they how they did it actually? Um [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4890.52s)]
*  In the past some of these hacks that appeared pretty sophisticated technically it's turned out that [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4894.96s)]
*  The hackers used social engineering, right like they [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4904.6s)]
*  As razzlecon wrapped in one song [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4911.08s)]
*  Spearfish your password all your funds transferred [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4914.4800000000005s)]
*  Like the multi sig makes it harder right right [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4921.64s)]
*  Yeah [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4925.12s)]
*  if I get two people to open my junk email and install malware on their computer, I might be able to steal both of their passwords and [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4925.56s)]
*  Transfer this crypto out. Um, I mean it's the amount of money [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4935.320000000001s)]
*  That's there to be stolen is so big that it justifies like a huge amount of effort by these hackers and so far [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4940.8s)]
*  With these crypto exchanges, it's just with each of them [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4947.92s)]
*  Nearly so many of them have gotten hacked over the years. I mean going back to [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4952.320000000001s)]
*  Their original big Bitcoin exchange no gocks or something Mount gocks. Yes [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4957.28s)]
*  It's just uh, it's just such a temptation that you've got this pile of [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4963.64s)]
*  You know one zero [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4969.24s)]
*  Sitting around by the way, I regret to inform you that razzlecon has been sentenced to 18 months [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4972.92s)]
*  for her theft of [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4979.04s)]
*  119,000 bitcoins. Wow, that's a lot of money in today's terms. Holy shit [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4981.8s)]
*  Okay. Well another person I want to ask you about that is huge in the crypto world is a guy named Justin Sun [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4986.639999999999s)]
*  Can you just explain who he is and his connections to the the Trump orbit? [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4992.2s)]
*  Justin Sun has been around in crypto since like [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=4997.08s)]
*  2017 which is a long time in in the [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5002.04s)]
*  In an industry where which seems seemingly turns over every two years as like a new set of players is [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5006.16s)]
*  Becomes billionaires and then a center prison [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5012.400000000001s)]
*  He [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5016.04s)]
*  founded what's called Tron, which is it's [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5017.4400000000005s)]
*  one of the most popular [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5021.76s)]
*  Blockchains used for like tons of transactions and [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5023.48s)]
*  He was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5028.2s)]
*  Over [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5034.36s)]
*  His fundraising for Tron now the SEC is is until recently at least was suing pretty much everybody in crypto and [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5036.879999999999s)]
*  a lot of these cases are just based on the idea that these cryptocurrencies are [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5044.48s)]
*  Unregistered securities like these sales should have followed the SEC rules [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5050.88s)]
*  But they didn't and the Trump administration has said we're gonna drop that type of case [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5057.160000000001s)]
*  But the Tron case is a little bit different because the SEC also alleged fraud in the offering like [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5062.84s)]
*  manipulative trading to dupe the public into [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5071.1s)]
*  investing in this Tron token sale [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5075.02s)]
*  So Justin Sun has said that's not true he's fighting the case but recently he did a little something that [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5078.46s)]
*  Might have been intended to help his cause. So president Trump [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5086.9400000000005s)]
*  Now has two or three crypto ventures depending on how you count [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5091.700000000001s)]
*  But his first one was called World Liberty Financial. He announced this in [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5095.9800000000005s)]
*  September and the pitch was truly unappealing [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5102.14s)]
*  It was some sort of vague [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5106.18s)]
*  crypto platform [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5109.66s)]
*  But so with a meme coin you you don't say it's connected to anything, right? [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5111.54s)]
*  You're just like this is gonna be fun by my meme coin, right? [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5117.66s)]
*  So my people get that right? Yeah fine, but with World Liberty they were like this is gonna be a crypto platform [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5119.82s)]
*  There's something real here. We're not really gonna say what it is yet [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5126.5s)]
*  also, if you buy the coins, you're not allowed to sell them and [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5130.62s)]
*  You don't get any profit ever [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5135.14s)]
*  so [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5137.820000000001s)]
*  What a deal. Yes [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5139.3s)]
*  And if you buy a dollar's worth of coins [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5142.660000000001s)]
*  75 cents of that is paid to the trumps as a licensing fee [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5147.34s)]
*  It was looking like the sale would kind of fail and maybe this thing wouldn't launch and Justin Sun stepped in he bought [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5151.740000000001s)]
*  30 million dollars of World Liberty coins and [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5159.38s)]
*  He later increased that in about another 40 million 40 or 45 million I think so [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5162.820000000001s)]
*  He kind of rescued the project and was made an advisor to the project and a few weeks after his purchase [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5171.18s)]
*  He was at a crypto conference in [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5179.66s)]
*  Abu Dhabi and there he was [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5182.5s)]
*  meeting with Eric Trump [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5185.46s)]
*  Meeting with Steve Wittkopf Trump's Middle East envoy who's also one of the founders of this World Liberty crypto project [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5187.7s)]
*  so it's really like [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5195.26s)]
*  An amazing conflict of interest like here's a guy who's got a serious fraud case before the SEC [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5199.02s)]
*  he's got a huge interest in how Trump decides crypto should be regulated and he's able to [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5205.22s)]
*  just give Trump more than 50 million dollars and [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5212.46s)]
*  Immediately secure a meeting with people who are close to Trump that should say [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5216.7s)]
*  He denies that his investment in World Liberty has anything to do with course getting out of trouble [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5222.139999999999s)]
*  But he also says the SEC case is very unfair [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5229.26s)]
*  Yeah [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5232.3s)]
*  So what you described there was you have this this failing? [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5232.82s)]
*  World Liberty financial offering this guy comes in he puts I think you said 75 million dollars into the project [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5236.46s)]
*  Rescues the project but 75% of that money gets skimmed right off the top for the Trump family. So what's that like 56 million or so? [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5242.94s)]
*  Directly into Trump's coffers the other crypto project we have that we know about for Trump are the Trump coin in the Melania coin [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5251.74s)]
*  I think the times the other day or maybe was coinbase somebody reported that [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5258.82s)]
*  As of a couple weeks ago Trump had made over a hundred million dollars [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5262.54s)]
*  In fees from the sale of the Trump coin, right? [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5267.780000000001s)]
*  Because so they might be holding on to their Trump meme coin stash [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5270.860000000001s)]
*  And I think they own something like what 80% or something like that, but every time you buy and sell they get a fee, right? [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5274.740000000001s)]
*  That's about right. Yeah, like Trump is still sitting on on paper [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5280.06s)]
*  like tens of billions of dollars worth of Trump meme coin he could not [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5284.5s)]
*  Really monetize that because if he started to sell it would drive the price down [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5289.54s)]
*  But as long as this sort of keeps going and people are trading it he can collect fees on it [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5295.5s)]
*  world Liberty has actually [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5302.42s)]
*  since Justin sons investment in the success of the Trump meme coin, it's kind of turned around and [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5304.820000000001s)]
*  By my calculation, I think that Trump has made the trumps have made [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5312.14s)]
*  Like at least 200 million off that one. They still haven't quite said what it is. It's gonna be some sort of platform for [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5317.740000000001s)]
*  borrowing and [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5324.7s)]
*  Lending crypto. Yeah. No, that's it's remarkable [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5326.54s)]
*  I mean, I think what I think the take-home [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5329.5s)]
*  I think I just wanted folks to get out of this interview as well a little bit of understanding about the crypto world [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5331.9s)]
*  But also how much money Trump is making personally off of crypto what an unbelievable [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5337.38s)]
*  Avenue the crypto world is for corruption and for steering money into his pockets at times [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5343.26s)]
*  In ways that are that can be secret and then there's just the broader fact that he's the president United States [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5349.82s)]
*  And he's gonna make an enormous number of incredibly consequential [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5355.9s)]
*  Decisions the next four years about how crypto is regulated. So it just seems like [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5359.42s)]
*  this just couldn't [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5364.34s)]
*  Be more fucked up just in terms of a setup for corruption and abuse in fraud at the highest level of the US government [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5366.14s)]
*  But I mean, I here we are I guess well Zeke. Thank you so much for explaining all this to me [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5373.26s)]
*  I'm laughing so that I don't cry in part because I didn't buy [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5378.34s)]
*  Cryptocurrency at any point along the last decade and that was a real mistake by me [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5382.740000000001s)]
*  But thank you so much for explaining it to all of us. I appreciate it [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh88VlXUKm0&t=5386.18s)]
