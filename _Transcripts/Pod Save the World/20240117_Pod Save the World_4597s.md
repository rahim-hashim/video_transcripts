Video Description: Ben Rhodes and Tommy Vietor discuss US airstrikes on the Houthi rebels in Yemen and why they are unlikely to deter them, and provide background and context on the Houthi’s origins and motivations. They also cover the latest in Gaza and frustration with the administration’s refusal to change course after 100 days. Then they discuss the recent spike in gang violence in Ecuador, efforts to prevent Guatemala’s new President from being sworn in, Taiwan’s election results and North Korea announcing the end of efforts to reunify the Korean peninsula. Then Tommy speaks with Oona Hathaway, Director of the Center for Global Legal Challenges at Yale Law School, about South Africa’s charges of genocide against Israel at the International Court of Justice.

# Who Are The Houthis & Why is The US Attacking Them? | Pod Save The World
**Pod Save the World:** [January 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0)
*  Welcome to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Ben Rhodes. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1.76s)]
*  Were you up really late last night at the real nail-biter in Iowa? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3.12s)]
*  Did they call the thing before people were voting? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=7.68s)]
*  You know, the funniest thing is that I thankfully did not have to do a podcast like you guys, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=10.32s)]
*  so I wasn't following it that closely. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=15.44s)]
*  And I got a news alert on my phone that just popped up and said, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=17.76s)]
*  Ron DeSantis wins second place in Iowa. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=22.0s)]
*  And I thought it was like the dumbest alert I've gotten in a while, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=25.28s)]
*  and that's saying something because the news media, the political news media, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=28.08s)]
*  has nothing to talk about, right? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=31.52s)]
*  And so they have to create drama around something. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  Exactly. Well, we know we have a lot to talk about because we talk about the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=36.16s)]
*  world, right? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=39.92s)]
*  The political side. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=40.32s)]
*  And the idea that this complete non-entity of a presidential candidate who has no path, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=41.44s)]
*  won a contest for second place 20% to like 19% merits, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=49.36s)]
*  like a news alert pushed out on everybody's phone, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=54.64s)]
*  is a sign that because all these people had no takes to write for weeks other than [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=56.8s)]
*  Iowa's really about second place in momentum, it was just so sad to see that. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=60.8s)]
*  And the turnout was like 110, 100,000 people because it was so cold that people didn't [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=65.36s)]
*  want to leave their houses and freeze to death. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=70.32s)]
*  I mean, yeah, it was like the worst possible outcome for news purposes for the country, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=72.16s)]
*  for Nikki Haley, because Trump won immediately and was able to dance on all their graves. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=77.12s)]
*  And then it was like too close to call for a while for Haley and DeSantis. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=82.16s)]
*  And she narrowly lost to him. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=85.68s)]
*  So she has an actual path to do well in New Hampshire and then maybe make something happen [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  in South Carolina, though I'm very, very skeptical. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=93.04s)]
*  He has absolutely no path, but now he's going to stay in and keep going. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=95.28s)]
*  And it's just like, ugh. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=98.88000000000001s)]
*  And it's also sad because I was thinking about caucus night in 2008. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=101.12s)]
*  I was in New Hampshire because I had deployed to New Hampshire. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=108.88000000000001s)]
*  And I remember crying in the office when Obama won. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=112.24s)]
*  And then I remember just like working to get ready for Obama to land in New Hampshire, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=116.56s)]
*  like in the middle of the night. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  Do like a 5 a.m. hangar rally at the airport. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=121.91999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=124.32s)]
*  And actually it was the last people in the office in New Hampshire were me and Ben LeBolt, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=124.56s)]
*  current White House Communications Director, Marty Adams, extraordinary human being, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=132.4s)]
*  just drinking probably the fourth case of Miller Lite cans that were there [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=137.92s)]
*  and just reading all the coverage of the Obama win. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=144.16s)]
*  And it felt like it was an historic occasion. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=147.76s)]
*  And now the Iowa caucus is like Ronda Sandis giving a four minute speech snarling about [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=150.72s)]
*  the media. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=158.16s)]
*  The media, I guess. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=158.64s)]
*  And Nikki Haley trying to pretend like she has a chance and Donald Trump [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=159.83999999999997s)]
*  delivering some not very persuasive. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=164.16s)]
*  Fifteen minutes of acknowledgment. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=167.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=168.88s)]
*  Anyway, we've come a long way from 2008. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=170.0s)]
*  I know it was not exactly hope and change or inspiration. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=172.23999999999998s)]
*  And I do wonder what it all means for the future of the Iowa caucus. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=174.72s)]
*  It is obviously on the Democratic side. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=179.28s)]
*  We got rid of Iowa. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=180.64s)]
*  But if a guy like Donald Trump can barely campaign, barely show up in the state and then win. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=181.67999999999998s)]
*  Now, I know he was like essentially an incumbent, but if retail politics [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  seemingly doesn't matter cycle after cycle, I just wonder if these early states will [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=191.76000000000002s)]
*  preserve their congratulations on dealing yourself out of relevance. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=195.84s)]
*  I will. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=199.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=200.0s)]
*  And what else to say? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=200.4s)]
*  Yeah, not great. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=201.44s)]
*  Not great. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=202.16s)]
*  Well, we got a great show, Ben. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=203.12s)]
*  We have a great show. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=204.24s)]
*  We are going to cover the US coalition airstrikes against the Houthi rebels in Yemen. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=205.20000000000002s)]
*  The latest from Gaza gang violence in Ecuador and an attempted coup in Guatemala. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=210.56s)]
*  We'll also cover the results of the election in Taiwan, which you [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=215.28s)]
*  previewed last week. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=218.96s)]
*  And then some not so great news out of North Korea. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=219.76000000000002s)]
*  And then I just did an interview with a woman named Ona Hathaway. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  She is from Yale University. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  We talked about South Africa's argument that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=228.32000000000002s)]
*  A little light interview about events at the Hague. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=233.52s)]
*  Actually, it was fascinating because we talked about why this case is the ICJ instead of the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=236.72s)]
*  ICC, which people are more familiar with. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=242.8s)]
*  Important distinction. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=244.88s)]
*  Threshold of proof you need to prove genocide. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=245.84s)]
*  The evidence that's been presented so far, the far reaching potential legal ramifications [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=249.28s)]
*  of the ICJ making a determination that genocide is happening for the United States and for the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=255.68s)]
*  US-Israeli relationship. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=260.40000000000003s)]
*  It was a fascinating conversation. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=262.0s)]
*  Yeah, a huge moment that's somehow flown a little bit under the radar in the US. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=264.08s)]
*  But the one thing I'm certain of is that these cases, not just this case, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=270.24s)]
*  there'll be other war crimes cases. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=275.52s)]
*  I'm sure there'll be cases at the ICC. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=276.96s)]
*  These are going to be around for years and years and years. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=279.2s)]
*  And I think people don't fully appreciate that. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=284.32s)]
*  I also think people don't fully appreciate in this country the degree to which around [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=286.0s)]
*  the world people are intensely following this and following it as it relates to some of [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=292.4s)]
*  their built up sense of grievance about the occupation. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=299.35999999999996s)]
*  But also some of their built up resentment of American double standards in the application [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=303.2s)]
*  of international justice. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=309.04s)]
*  So I think this is a bigger deal than even the enormous deal that it is as it relates [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=310.0s)]
*  to the immediate conflict. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=315.76s)]
*  This is, it feels like a kind of seismic moment for the whole idea of international justice. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=316.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=322.8s)]
*  And we also talked about how present history is at this trial because you have the history [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=323.04s)]
*  of the Holocaust, you have the history of apartheid in South Africa and how that context [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=328.16s)]
*  is awash in all of these debates and conversations and what will be adjudicated. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=333.04s)]
*  It's like pretty incredible moment. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=336.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=338.24s)]
*  Okay, Ben, let's talk about the US and Yemen and the Houthi rebels. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=338.8s)]
*  So last week, US and British fighter jets hit around 30 sites in northern and western Yemen [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=343.28000000000003s)]
*  used by the Houthi rebel group to launch in store drones and missiles. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=348.96000000000004s)]
*  This military response came in response to the Houthis firing dozens of drones and missiles [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=352.8s)]
*  at commercial ships in the Red Sea. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=357.04s)]
*  The Houthis say they're targeting ships in the Red Sea to pressure Israel to stop the [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=359.44s)]
*  war in Gaza. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=362.48s)]
*  Last week, we talked about how the US Navy had directly engaged in combat with the Houthis [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=363.6s)]
*  back in December. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=369.6s)]
*  Before that, the US assembled this 20 country maritime coalition to defend ships in the [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=370.8s)]
*  Red Sea and they had shot down about 60 plus Houthi projectiles, drones, rockets, et cetera. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=375.6s)]
*  However, the group of countries that participated in these airstrikes in Yemen was much smaller. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=382.23999999999995s)]
*  It was the US, the UK, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, and Bahrain. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=388.4s)]
*  So US officials say the strikes damaged or destroyed about 20 to 30% of the Houthis' [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=392.71999999999997s)]
*  offensive capabilities. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=397.67999999999995s)]
*  The goal here was to deter future Houthi attacks, but a lot of experts say the Houthis are not [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=399.28s)]
*  likely to be deterred. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=404.96s)]
*  They are very comfortable being at war and rallying their followers around a cause like [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=406.08s)]
*  this or an enemy like the United States. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=411.2s)]
*  On Monday, CENTCOM said that an anti-ship missile fired by the Houthis hit a US-owned [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=413.36s)]
*  cargo ship, so seemingly not deterred yet. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=418.24s)]
*  Ben, we talked last week about why we thought strikes in Yemen would be a bad idea. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=421.59999999999997s)]
*  Part of that rationale was a lack of authorization from Congress. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=427.68s)]
*  Sure enough, members of Congress are not thrilled with what happened. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=433.2s)]
*  Here's a clip. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=436.4s)]
*  The president engaged in these strikes without seeking congressional approval. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=437.03999999999996s)]
*  The White House was telegraphing that there was going to be some retaliation. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=441.35999999999996s)]
*  So there was certainly time and space to come to Congress and consult with Congress and ask [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=445.76s)]
*  for our authority, particularly because the Houthis were saying that the reason that they're [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=452.32s)]
*  doing this is because of the war in Gaza. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=456.64s)]
*  So I think that the implications of all of this are that the United States could be pushed [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=461.03999999999996s)]
*  into a significant set of hostilities and a committing of our resources, and that is [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=466.88s)]
*  something that Congress should consider. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=474.96s)]
*  You should have come as the Constitution requires to Congress, and that was echoed in a bipartisan [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=476.24s)]
*  way by Senator Mike Lee, Representative Jonathan Jackson, and many other senators and congresspeople [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=482.15999999999997s)]
*  so that we can discuss whether this actually could put more American troops at risk. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=488.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm concerned about retaliation in Iraq and whether it could draw us into a Middle East war, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=492.96s)]
*  and I believe that he did not follow the Constitution. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=497.84s)]
*  Those are Democrats, Congressman Pramila Jayapal and Congressman Ro Khanna. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=500.56s)]
*  So Ben, thoughts on this decision now that it's happened? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=505.03999999999996s)]
*  My thoughts haven't changed. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=511.12s)]
*  I think our segment holds up pretty well from last week. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=512.56s)]
*  Here's what I'd add to it, a couple of things. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=516.96s)]
*  First on the Congress piece, I think what's important, what you heard from Jayapal and Ro Khanna, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=519.12s)]
*  is there's consistency to their position. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=524.8s)]
*  In the Trump years, there was a coalition of a lot of Democrats that opposed even the [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=528.4s)]
*  participation of the United States in the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=534.88s)]
*  because there was no authorization from Congress. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=539.6s)]
*  And I think it's really important, whether you're talking about domestic laws relates [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=541.2s)]
*  to war powers, or you're talking about foreign policy, that we can't change our positions just [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=545.6s)]
*  because the Democrat is president. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=551.6s)]
*  And I'm sure the Biden people will mount an argument rooted in some form of self-defense, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=554.0s)]
*  ship stripping attack, and that, okay. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=559.36s)]
*  It's probably some truth to that. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=561.76s)]
*  But then take it to Congress. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=563.28s)]
*  That is different than what was happening before, but I still think it holds that this [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=565.36s)]
*  should go to Congress. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=569.68s)]
*  And I think what you also hear in Ro Khanna's statement is, the reason the administration [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=570.3199999999999s)]
*  should particularly do that is this has the potential to be one of those left-right issues, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=575.04s)]
*  where the left is uncomfortable with this because it's the president potentially getting us into [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=579.04s)]
*  another war, and the right, the libertarian right, is similarly uncomfortable with it [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=584.24s)]
*  because it's extreme presidential power. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=587.5999999999999s)]
*  That's a dangerous place to be with Congress, because you can get to a majority, a bipartisan [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=589.92s)]
*  majority pretty quick. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=594.64s)]
*  And in the Trump years, I think we saw nearly veto-proof majorities in that space. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=595.76s)]
*  So watch that. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=600.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=600.9599999999999s)]
*  You know, I didn't like it. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=601.28s)]
*  It was Donald Trump who truth the following. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=602.0s)]
*  So let me get this straight. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=604.4s)]
*  We're dropping bombs all over the Middle East again, where I defeated ISIS in Perens. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=605.4399999999999s)]
*  Our secretary of defense, misspelled, who just went missing for five days, is running [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=610.24s)]
*  the war from his laptop in a hospital room. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=613.84s)]
*  So that was a... [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=616.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, you know. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=617.04s)]
*  Future. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=617.84s)]
*  Probably cannot meet Donald Trump. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=618.34s)]
*  We look forward to a robust debate on the issues. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=619.92s)]
*  The fundamental thing I want to say about this is, I was thinking about how to add to [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=622.48s)]
*  what I said last week about this is lighting a fuse. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=626.16s)]
*  It's an escalation to go into Yemen and not just hit them in the Red Sea. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=628.96s)]
*  I was thinking of a parallel and a lesson that the US should learn. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=631.92s)]
*  And it's a lesson I feel like I learned eight years ago in the White House. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=635.5999999999999s)]
*  It is one thing to hit a terrorist organization that is largely made up of foreigners who [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=640.0s)]
*  get a safe haven someplace. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=648.4s)]
*  So Al-Qaeda, a lot of Al-Qaeda was people that moved to that border region of Pakistan [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=649.8399999999999s)]
*  and Afghanistan to kind of plot attacks. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=656.0799999999999s)]
*  Saudis like Bin Laden. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=658.7199999999999s)]
*  Saudis like Bin Laden. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=659.84s)]
*  Saudis like Bin Laden. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=661.12s)]
*  A lot of ISIS was foreign fighters. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=661.9200000000001s)]
*  And remember, foreign fighters pouring into Syria and Iraq to support that. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=664.24s)]
*  And if you go and you launch a military campaign against foreigners who are using a geographical [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=668.48s)]
*  space to kind of launch attacks, you actually can defeat those people. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=674.08s)]
*  You cannot defeat people who just live in the place where they live. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=678.64s)]
*  And I was thinking of a parallel that's not a direct parallel, but bear with me. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=683.2800000000001s)]
*  Do you remember the Haqqani network, Tommy? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=689.28s)]
*  So the Haqqani network was kind of an aspect of the Taliban insurgency. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=691.8399999999999s)]
*  It was kind of distinct in a certain part of Afghanistan, northeast Afghanistan, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=696.56s)]
*  kind of along the Pakistan border. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=702.4s)]
*  Like Waziristan? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=703.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=704.64s)]
*  Big Stan guys. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=704.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=705.8399999999999s)]
*  And the US military really hated these guys because they carried a lot of terrorist attacks. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=706.56s)]
*  They're very lethal. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=710.8s)]
*  And so we were constantly kind of ramping up military pressure on the Haqqani network. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=712.16s)]
*  But if you looked at what the Haqqani network was, it makes it sound like it's some [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=716.56s)]
*  like a foreign terrorist organization or something. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=720.3199999999999s)]
*  The Haqqanis were tribes that lived in that part of Afghanistan. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=723.8399999999999s)]
*  You weren't going to defeat people that just live, the Houthis live in Yemen. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=727.1199999999999s)]
*  Like they're not going to surrender. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=732.4s)]
*  We've seen that. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=734.56s)]
*  They've lived through years of war and they've proven their resilience through that process. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=735.68s)]
*  The kinds of weapons they have are pretty cheap to acquire. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=742.2399999999999s)]
*  They feed on this conflict. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=746.08s)]
*  Hamas, the Houthis, they want the US in this conflict. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=749.76s)]
*  That's their objective. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=753.36s)]
*  They want their arsonists. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=754.24s)]
*  They want the whole region to be on fire. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=755.52s)]
*  And so I just think escalating into Yemen, there's not an achievable military objective. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=757.36s)]
*  You're not going to defeat these people. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=763.12s)]
*  You're not going to deter them from launching these attacks. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=765.04s)]
*  I think it's better to try to focus on protecting something clear like shipping to the Red Sea. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=768.08s)]
*  Once you kind of bring this war into Yemen, it gets unpredictable. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=773.68s)]
*  They're firing back in other places. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=776.8s)]
*  There's the risk of escalation in Iraq from other proxy groups attacking US forces or [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=779.1999999999999s)]
*  diplomatic targets. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=784.16s)]
*  Things could pop up and blow up in other parts of this region. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=785.8399999999999s)]
*  I just think when you escalate against a group that cannot be defeated, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=788.88s)]
*  that is going to be where they are, that has a surrounding population, by the way, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=792.4s)]
*  in Yemen that hates the United States because they believe that we were part of, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=795.76s)]
*  understandably believe that we were part of a war that's caused humanitarian catastrophe, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=799.5999999999999s)]
*  I, you're kind of, the flames are getting bigger and I don't think that you're putting them out. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=804.4s)]
*  That's really, really good context. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=809.76s)]
*  And I want to do a little more background on that. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=811.52s)]
*  And by the way, now the Hukani network is in the cabinet in Afghanistan with the Taliban. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=813.44s)]
*  All is well that ends well. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=818.24s)]
*  No, the exact opposite. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=819.28s)]
*  Yeah, so a little more on the Houthis. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=820.24s)]
*  They are Zaydis, which is a subsect of Shia Islam. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=821.6800000000001s)]
*  And in the 80s, the Saudis and the Yemeni government started promoting this more hardline [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=824.88s)]
*  version of Sunni Islam in predominantly Zaydi areas. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=830.08s)]
*  That led to this indigenous domestic resistance movement, including the rise of a cleric named [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=833.2800000000001s)]
*  Hussein al-Houthi, whose followers became called the Houthis. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=838.48s)]
*  So then to your point about, you know, this all swirling together, in 2003, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=841.76s)]
*  Houthi leaders called for mass protests in Yemen in response to the Yemeni government's support [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=846.32s)]
*  for the US invasion of Iraq. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=850.96s)]
*  And around that time, the Houthis also started calling for the extermination of America and [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=853.0400000000001s)]
*  Israel. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=856.1600000000001s)]
*  That led to the Yemeni government to crack down on the Houthis. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=856.88s)]
*  They killed Hussein al-Houthi in 2004. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=860.08s)]
*  That leads to the first Yemeni civil war. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=862.8s)]
*  Fast forward a few years and several conflicts. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=865.4399999999999s)]
*  In 2011, during the Arab Spring, the Houthis seized part of northern Yemen. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=867.8399999999999s)]
*  And then in 2014, they took control of Sanaa, the capital, which leads you to 2015, which is [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=871.52s)]
*  when the Saudis launched this disastrous military campaign to dislodge the Houthis. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=876.4s)]
*  By the way, the UN, we've talked about it before, but the UN estimates that through 2021, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=880.8s)]
*  the war in Yemen killed 377,000 people. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=885.68s)]
*  More than half of those were from starvation or lack of health care, et cetera. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=890.4799999999999s)]
*  And millions were displaced. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=894.4799999999999s)]
*  There was a ceasefire reached in 2022. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=895.76s)]
*  That ceasefire and how fragile it can feel is part of why you and I talked about it being a [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=898.56s)]
*  bad idea to launch strikes into Yemen last week. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=902.9599999999999s)]
*  But I wanted to share more of this background because it's interesting, but also I think [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=904.88s)]
*  it complicates the oversimplified narratives I think you're seeing a lot in the media about [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=909.28s)]
*  the Houthis, right? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=914.16s)]
*  The first narrative is they're an Iranian proxy group. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=915.04s)]
*  All their claims about caring about Gaza are bullshit, right? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=918.64s)]
*  That's narrative one. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=921.1999999999999s)]
*  Narrative two, talk about sort of the horseshoe theory here. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=922.24s)]
*  On the right, it's like, these guys are brave anti-imperialist freedom fighters. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=925.1999999999999s)]
*  The reality is a lot more complicated. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=928.9599999999999s)]
*  The Houthis have fired missiles at ships that had nothing to do with Israel. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=930.7199999999999s)]
*  But I think we should take them at their word that they are doing this because the war in [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=933.76s)]
*  Gaza motivated them to do so. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=938.9599999999999s)]
*  They were probably prodded by the Iranians, but certainly I think we should listen to them. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=940.56s)]
*  But also, the people cheering for the Houthis for standing up for Gaza should probably know [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=944.4s)]
*  that Yemeni human rights groups have accused them of subjecting Ethiopian migrants to sexual [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=949.52s)]
*  slavery and other abuses. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=954.16s)]
*  So these are not good guys. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=955.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=957.6s)]
*  Don't be cheering for these guys in Times Square. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=958.0799999999999s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=960.88s)]
*  But it's just like, to me, it just gets back to the point, like, okay, let's take them [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=961.76s)]
*  at their word and let's view the war in Gaza as the key to reducing tensions and de-escalating [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=965.4399999999999s)]
*  and not necessarily blowing up stuff in parts of Yemen that have been, you know, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=973.76s)]
*  that have dealt with airstrikes for years now. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=979.12s)]
*  You made this point last week, and it's a really good point, which is that just because [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=981.04s)]
*  you know, we don't like that this group is kind of coming into the war in Gaza and doing it by [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=986.72s)]
*  firing weapons indiscriminately at, like, container ships in the Red Sea doesn't mean that it's not [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=993.68s)]
*  true that that's why they're doing it. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=998.4s)]
*  And the fact of the matter is they weren't doing it before the war in Gaza. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=999.92s)]
*  So, you know, it's not about, like, trusting them. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1004.4s)]
*  It's about the fact that this, when you have a war that is escalating as the war is in Gaza, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1006.8s)]
*  other groups, whether they're being opportunistic or whether they're being ideological or whatever [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1012.16s)]
*  the reason is, they're going to start to do shit like this. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1015.8399999999999s)]
*  And so it is a part of the war in Gaza. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1018.64s)]
*  Even if we want to kind of separate it out and say, no, no, we're not going to grant them [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1021.12s)]
*  legitimacy. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1024.8000000000002s)]
*  It's just a reality that you've seen more active violence from different groups across the region [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1025.2800000000002s)]
*  so long as this war continues to escalate in Gaza. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1031.5200000000002s)]
*  And so therefore we have to see this as de-escalation that has to involve the war in Gaza. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1034.16s)]
*  I think the other thing that you said that's really important is that I remember in 2015 [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1041.3600000000001s)]
*  when the Saudis were getting more and more exercised about the Houthis and ultimately [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1046.5600000000002s)]
*  launched this kind of misguided intervention into Yemen. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1050.88s)]
*  It was not the case that they were like, the Saudis liked to present, and particularly [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1055.68s)]
*  their friends in Washington, you know, like the Foundation for the Defense of Democracy type [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1061.2800000000002s)]
*  people, liked to present them as literally like the IRGC, that they were like part of the Iranian, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1065.68s)]
*  you know, Iranian-backed Houthis. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1070.64s)]
*  But they were not like a creation of Iran. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1073.5200000000002s)]
*  That's why the history you did is so important. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1077.5200000000002s)]
*  They're literally named after a guy just like the Houthis, who lived in Yemen. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1079.44s)]
*  They're people in Yemen with grievances. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1083.6000000000001s)]
*  It doesn't mean they're good guys. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1086.0s)]
*  It doesn't mean that they're right about everything. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1087.2s)]
*  It just means that it's not like the Iranians invented them. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1088.96s)]
*  They are a force in Yemen that has a relationship with Iran that is tied to their sectarian [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1093.3600000000001s)]
*  identity as Shia and that involves the Iranians providing them with weapons, you know. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1098.64s)]
*  They don't take all their orders from the Iranians. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1103.76s)]
*  Everything they're doing is not an extension of Iranian foreign policy. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1106.48s)]
*  It's murkier than that. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1108.88s)]
*  The Iranians have a degree of influence of the Houthis, like they do with militias in Iraq, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1110.4s)]
*  like they do with Hezbollah, like they do with Hamas. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1114.4s)]
*  But these are also independent actors. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1117.1200000000001s)]
*  And it just shows you that it's not as simple as saying we're all fighting, because this is how [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1119.2s)]
*  the debate gets presented in Washington, we're all fighting one battle against some Iranian block [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1125.28s)]
*  across the region. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1131.2s)]
*  That's not really the case. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1132.72s)]
*  There's localized grievances. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1134.0s)]
*  There's a lot of history to these places. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1135.6s)]
*  These people have independent power bases and they have relationships to Iran. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1137.28s)]
*  I'm not saying that in any way to let Iran off the hook for what they do provide, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1140.9599999999998s)]
*  but it's misguided thinking to believe that there's just this simplified, you know, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1144.48s)]
*  axis of Iranian proxies that can be defeated by punching them really hard in the face. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1150.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1155.36s)]
*  Trump, on the way out the door, designated the Houthis as a terrorist group. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1156.6399999999999s)]
*  President Biden reversed that decision. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1160.56s)]
*  A lot of good that day. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1161.4399999999998s)]
*  Really put them out of business. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1162.08s)]
*  Set them back. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1163.9199999999998s)]
*  Biden reversed that decision in February of 2021 because the administration was concerned [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1165.3600000000001s)]
*  that it would make it much harder to deliver aid to Yemen, one of the most impoverished countries [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1171.92s)]
*  in the world, certainly the region. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1177.2s)]
*  I mean, 75% of the country needs humanitarian assistance. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1178.64s)]
*  I do worry you're going to see a lot of pressure on President Biden to reverse that reversal, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1181.2s)]
*  even though it probably wouldn't do anything. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1186.48s)]
*  Other than make it harder to deliver assistance. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1188.64s)]
*  I mean, we dealt with this in Somalia. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1190.64s)]
*  People want, you know, Al-Shabaab is a terrorist group, designated terrorist group in Somalia. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1192.48s)]
*  And we had times in the Obama administration when there was real famine in Somalia, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1197.52s)]
*  but we couldn't deliver any assistance there because some of the assistance might have [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1201.6s)]
*  reached Al-Shabaab and then therefore you're violating your own sanctions. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1204.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1207.44s)]
*  And so what? [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1207.94s)]
*  You're going to let a lot of innocent people die because of some designation that only [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1208.56s)]
*  really matters in Washington, you know? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1212.08s)]
*  It just, it shows you how these tools that are available to the U.S. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1214.4s)]
*  like don't fit the problems they're trying to solve. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1218.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1220.96s)]
*  So let's talk about Gaza for a minute because this is all stemming from the war there. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1221.84s)]
*  So I think we try to be measured on the show and how we talk about everything, right? [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1225.28s)]
*  Because the issues are hard, the jobs are harder. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1229.6799999999998s)]
*  We know your options can be bad or worse. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1231.76s)]
*  We know that sometimes your boss makes a decision you don't agree with, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1233.36s)]
*  you're stuck implementing it. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1236.0s)]
*  And I imagine that is probably especially hard right now because you have all these [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1237.52s)]
*  people in government who dedicated their careers to the creation of a Palestinian state [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1241.36s)]
*  and are watching their life's work unravel, right? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1245.52s)]
*  Because of this war in Gaza. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1248.56s)]
*  And so like that's why... [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1250.24s)]
*  Yeah, I know some of those people. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1252.64s)]
*  Yeah, and like so I think that that's why, you know, sometimes we, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1253.84s)]
*  our tones are measured and we let the facts do the talking. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1257.44s)]
*  But I just want to be clear, like what's happening in Gaza right now is indefensible. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1259.6s)]
*  And it's not just the death toll, which is staggering. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1264.64s)]
*  We're talking about 1% of the population, including thousands of kids. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1266.72s)]
*  And by the way, all the sort of truthers out there who say, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1270.88s)]
*  well, you know, the Gaza Health Ministry is Hamas run, those numbers are probably wrong. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1274.56s)]
*  I think most people now believe that the death toll is higher than what [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1278.24s)]
*  the Gaza Health Ministry is reporting because people are under the rubble. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1281.68s)]
*  And then also, I mean, I'm sure there's people who are have unrelated illnesses [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1284.48s)]
*  that they can't get treated because there's no longer any health infrastructure. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1288.0s)]
*  And I just think that more than 10,000 children have died. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1291.92s)]
*  So the people that want to be truthers or say that, you know, 9,000 of these people [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1296.3200000000002s)]
*  are Hamas fighters, which is a figure that the IDF puts out without describing how they [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1301.3600000000001s)]
*  categorize what is a Hamas fighter. They might just be counting military age males or something. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1306.72s)]
*  How do you reckon with that figure of the number of children dead? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1312.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1315.44s)]
*  And look, you're right. I mean, I've almost run out of ways to talk about why I'm so appalled by [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1316.32s)]
*  what's happening. I think one of the simplest ways you can kind of try to explain this to someone [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1323.68s)]
*  who maybe is trying to see it from all sides. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1331.4399999999998s)]
*  When the U.S., again, which I'm not saying the U.S. has covered itself in total morality here [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1338.6399999999999s)]
*  in its war on terrorism, right. But, you know, drone strikes, right, which, again, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1345.28s)]
*  people can mount very credible arguments against is not to defend drone strikes. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1352.8s)]
*  This is saying even something very controversial like drone strikes. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1357.04s)]
*  Involved like sending very precise weapons at an established terrorist target. They have been dropping [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1361.76s)]
*  scores of 2,000 pound bombs on Gaza. There is nothing targeted about that. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1373.04s)]
*  No. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1380.8799999999999s)]
*  You cannot say that you're taking the utmost care to avoid civilian casualties as you are dropping [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1381.3799999999999s)]
*  2,000 pound bombs on civilians and on targets where you've said, OK, move south and then we're [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1389.12s)]
*  going to bomb that too. Like this is not complicated. A 2,000 pound bomb, this didn't [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1396.32s)]
*  just happen once, this happened a lot of times, right, is not a precise weapon. And that to me, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1403.6799999999998s)]
*  is an indefensible use of force and no rationalization or you can't kind of talk [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1411.28s)]
*  your way through that one. Yeah. And the results speak for themselves. I mean, Gaza has been leveled. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1417.84s)]
*  More than half of all buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed. In northern Gaza, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1421.84s)]
*  it's closer to 70 to 80% of buildings that are damaged or destroyed. The country is on the brink [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1426.48s)]
*  of famine. There's no access to clean water. People are either crowded into these refugee camps [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1430.9599999999998s)]
*  in the south or about 300,000 people are stranded in the north where the UN says only one quarter [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1436.1599999999999s)]
*  of aid shipments have actually reached their destination this year. So people in northern Gaza [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1442.9599999999998s)]
*  that no one can reach are starving to death. Senator Chris Van Hollen recently went to the [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1446.88s)]
*  border crossing and said that Israeli inspectors are rejecting aid shipments into Gaza for reasons [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1452.4s)]
*  that, quote, seemed purely arbitrary. Again, this is Chris Van Hollen. He's not some like far left guy [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1457.2800000000002s)]
*  chanting from the river to see a protest. He's like a middle of the road democratic politician. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1463.44s)]
*  And people who say, OK, what about the hostages? Only one hostage has been rescued in a military [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1468.0800000000002s)]
*  operation. And that was back in October. The rest got out because of diplomacy. And so again, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1473.44s)]
*  despite all the talk from the Biden administration about prodding the Israelis to shift into a lower [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1479.68s)]
*  intensity combat with fewer airstrikes, that has not happened. And it will not happen unless [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1485.52s)]
*  the US actually exerts real pressure. Like we talked about this last week, the Hug BB strategy [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1490.8s)]
*  has failed, publicly telegraphing that the US would never pressure Netanyahu publicly, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1496.16s)]
*  and would never even consider conditioning aid. It was clear to me was always going to make it [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1501.68s)]
*  easier for him to act with impunity. And the backdrop was always going to be the political [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1506.8s)]
*  context where Netanyahu knows that he can only avoid political accountability as long as the war [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1512.72s)]
*  is still going and he is still in office. And so again, I think the thing Biden deserves credit for [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1518.48s)]
*  is for in those early days pressuring Israel not to launch a preemptive attack on Hezbollah [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1523.52s)]
*  because there's lots of reporting that they were very close. But now the conflict is once again, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1528.3999999999999s)]
*  spiraling again, the risk of escalation with Hezbollah is growing. You're seeing like the [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1533.52s)]
*  defense minister saying like, the clock is ticking basically, we're gonna have to turn the hourglass [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1539.04s)]
*  over some sort of scary rhetoric. The Houthis are taking shots at us. Iran is firing weapons into [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1543.84s)]
*  Iraq. They say it's because of ISIS, but you know, I think it probably sends a message to a lot of [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1551.6799999999998s)]
*  folks. So it's just it's so long past time to demand a ceasefire to negotiate the release of [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1556.08s)]
*  hostages to put conditions on future assistance and to just like stop allowing the Netanyahu [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1560.96s)]
*  government to drive policies. They're decimating Gaza, but also making Israel less safe and making [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1567.1999999999998s)]
*  the United States less safe. No, it's revealing the why you can't say you're going to hug a country [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1573.12s)]
*  and hug a government and not impose any conditions on any aid they get and criticize them in private [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1580.16s)]
*  and think that that's somehow going to matter when it's this kind of government. You know, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1587.84s)]
*  that might work with a different Israeli government, right? But it's not going to work [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1591.2s)]
*  with Bibi Netanyahu and this kind of group of extremists that are to his right wing in this [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1594.8799999999999s)]
*  coalition. And look, if there was a ceasefire today, we should be very clear, like it's already [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1599.28s)]
*  so far beyond an acceptable level of loss of life. We're talking about 25,000 people, maybe more [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1607.28s)]
*  killed, children killed. We're talking about this place, Gaza, just leveled. We're talking about [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1614.48s)]
*  hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people displaced. We're talking about a degree of trauma [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1620.56s)]
*  on children who've been maimed or who've lived through this bombing for three months already [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1625.52s)]
*  that is going to be with them for the rest of their lives. So it's not like a ceasefire ends [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1631.1200000000001s)]
*  the suffering for these people. They are going to be living with trauma. They're going to be [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1635.2s)]
*  living with injury. They're going to be living with their parents or sons and daughters or brothers [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1638.48s)]
*  and sisters. For what purpose? To take out some of the military wing of Hamas and to blow up some [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1642.64s)]
*  tunnels? Is that really worth the destruction that we've seen in Gaza? And look, the White House, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1649.1200000000001s)]
*  President Biden, you know, clearly they're uncomfortable with what's happening because [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1656.4s)]
*  they keep telling us that. And I'm sure that they are delivering that message in private. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1661.04s)]
*  But again, until and unless and until you're willing to say there's a breaking point here [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1664.88s)]
*  where we're not going to provide assistance or we're not going to kind of shield what you're [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1670.24s)]
*  doing and talking points about like, you know, someday there might be a Palestinian state when [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1674.4s)]
*  that's not the policy of the Israeli government. You know, that doesn't work as policy. And I [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1678.5600000000002s)]
*  do want to just say one thing, Tommy. I don't usually jump on things that like kind of pop [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1683.92s)]
*  up repeatedly on my social media feeds. But I'm going to do like putting out a statement on the [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1689.12s)]
*  100th day of this war about the hostages makes sense. Of course, because we have to express [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1694.9599999999998s)]
*  empathy to families that do not have their loved ones with them. And we have to show that we are [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1704.7199999999998s)]
*  remembering them. And there's Americans potentially that are part of that. That is entirely appropriate. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1710.8s)]
*  But I do think that not thinking through what message it sends to put out a statement like that [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1717.5200000000002s)]
*  and have no messaging whatsoever about just the loss of life that's taken place. And for people [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1723.5200000000002s)]
*  in CIA, there's a statement went up from President Biden about the hostages that didn't mention [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1730.0s)]
*  Palestinians at all. If part of the dynamic that you're wrestling with internationally, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1732.96s)]
*  and even domestically is that this is a do lives matter kind of dynamic. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1740.16s)]
*  Whether that's your intended message or not, like it just suggests that the lives of these [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1747.5200000000002s)]
*  people don't matter the same. And we have to as a country and as a government, not send that message. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1753.0400000000002s)]
*  And I just please like I hope that there's a corrective to that and not just messaging and [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1759.2s)]
*  policy going forward. And I'm glad, you know, what I will say is there are very well intentioned [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1766.64s)]
*  people serving the US government who don't go to work wanting to do this. And I frankly, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1774.48s)]
*  I don't think Joe Biden doesn't go. I'm sure he wishes this wasn't happening. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1779.04s)]
*  Of course. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1783.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm sure he wishes someone other than Bibi Netanyahu is prime minister of Israel. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1785.44s)]
*  So I do think it is possible to say, look, like it's not like everybody goes to work at the state [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1789.6000000000001s)]
*  department or the White House is somehow like, you know, happy that this is happening or even [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1794.8s)]
*  supportive of it. But, you know, you own the circumstances that you're part of. I had to deal [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1800.48s)]
*  with that. I didn't agree with everything that happened when I was in White House. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1806.5600000000002s)]
*  And this is necessary that there be voices that just show that like, this is not normal. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1811.68s)]
*  This is not intolerable. So far past the point of no return. It's completely intolerable. And [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1820.88s)]
*  look, I mean, early on, there was a constant communication between Biden himself and Netanyahu. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1827.04s)]
*  Now they reportedly haven't spoken in three weeks. I'm not sure what level the pressure is [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1833.92s)]
*  coming from on the Israelis to change course. I mean, it's clearly not working, but I don't [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1838.48s)]
*  know where the pressure is coming from. Bernie Sanders is trying to force a vote in the Senate [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1841.68s)]
*  today, Tuesday on stopping aid to Israel until basically a human rights report can be created [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1844.8799999999999s)]
*  on how the weapons are being used. That's probably going to get like seven votes. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1851.12s)]
*  Which is supposed to be existing US policy. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1854.1599999999999s)]
*  I know. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1856.08s)]
*  This is what I mean about it's not normal. Normal is that there are conditions for human [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1856.8s)]
*  rights attached to all US military systems. That's normal. It's just not enforced in this case. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1862.16s)]
*  And again, Chris Van Hollen, down the road Democrat said, quote, my view is that the [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1867.2s)]
*  Biden administration has not adequately exercised US influence and leverage to achieve our goals. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1871.76s)]
*  There's a big difference between stating our objectives and achieving them. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1876.56s)]
*  I think that's a fair observation. And again, one other, not to talk to the shadow box social [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1879.68s)]
*  media, but the other rejoinder you hear all the time is like, why are you calling on the [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1885.04s)]
*  Israeli government to do X, Y, and Z? Why aren't you calling on Hamas to put down their arms? [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1888.72s)]
*  Like hostages go with that? Of course, Hamas would never fucking listen to us. Of course, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1892.3999999999999s)]
*  everyone's calling on Hamas. I don't want to have any role whatsoever in the future of Gaza, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1896.32s)]
*  the Palestinian people or the Middle East. And again, like from the very beginning, like there's [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1900.96s)]
*  an appropriate use of force against the military wing of Hamas, but that's just not what we're [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1906.0s)]
*  seeing. And the US doesn't provide $3 billion a year to Hamas's military. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1911.44s)]
*  Yeah. Well, those 2000 bombs are American bombs. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1915.92s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Okay, we are going to take a quick break and we come back. We are going to talk about [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=1919.04s)]

*  Simply Safe. Some very scary scenes in Ecuador recently where gangs have basically started to [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2004.48s)]
*  wage war on the government. Here is the backstory of what happened. So several weeks back Ecuador's [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2008.64s)]
*  prosecutor launched a major operation to root out corruption in the government, especially cooperation [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2014.24s)]
*  between government officials and drug gangs. They made a bunch of arrests, including some judges, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2018.56s)]
*  some police and the former prison authority director who are coordinating with these narco [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2024.0s)]
*  gangs. The government is also planning to transfer several gang leaders from the prisons they were [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2028.8s)]
*  in to a maximum security prison. That news somehow leaked to the gangs themselves and two gang leaders [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2033.92s)]
*  escaped before they could be moved. In response, President Daniel Niboa declared a state of emergency [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2040.96s)]
*  in a war on the gangs and there was this explosion of violence. So you had inmates in several [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2047.52s)]
*  prisons taking hostages. They took about 200 guards and staff hostage. Police were kidnapped [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2052.8s)]
*  in some areas. About 11 people were killed. And then the thing I bet a lot of people saw back here [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2058.5600000000004s)]
*  in the U.S. is gang members stormed into a TV station and broadcast themselves taking the employees [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2064.88s)]
*  hostage live on television and delivered this statement to the president, President Niboa, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2071.76s)]
*  to stop his crackdown on gangs. So this will be an enormous test for Niboa going forward. He just [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2076.64s)]
*  took office in November. Vox had a fascinating story about how Ecuador went from being one of the [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2082.8799999999997s)]
*  most stable, peaceful, upper middle income countries in the region to this intolerable level of violence. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2088.72s)]
*  It talks about how the demobilization of the FARC rebel group in Colombia coupled with declining [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2096.3199999999997s)]
*  demands for cocaine in the U.S. but an increased demand in Europe made Ecuador's ports more valuable [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2101.68s)]
*  and there was this power vacuum without the FARC that was filled by cartels from Mexico, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2107.7599999999998s)]
*  gangs from Venezuela, even the Albanian mafia I guess moved in. As they do. They're always everywhere. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2113.3599999999997s)]
*  So that fed into existing turf wars and then the result was basically homicides went from, they [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2119.52s)]
*  quadrupled since 2018. And last year we talked about how a presidential candidate was assassinated. So [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2124.48s)]
*  Ben, here's a clip of President Niboa on CNN talking about the support that he thinks he [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2130.56s)]
*  needs from the international community. We need international cooperation. I would gladly accept [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2135.2799999999997s)]
*  cooperation from the U.S. We need equipment. We need weapons. We need intelligence. And I think [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2141.52s)]
*  that this is a global problem. It's not only in Ecuador. This is a problem that goes beyond borders. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2148.7999999999997s)]
*  About 35, 40 percent of the drugs that come out of Ecuador go to the states. Another similar [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2156.72s)]
*  percentage to Europe. So this has to be treated as an international problem. So Ben, State Department [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2161.6s)]
*  is going to send a bunch of the delegation of diplomats, folks in the military, law enforcement [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2167.44s)]
*  to provide some sort of assistance to Ecuador. What do you think the role is for the U.S. here to [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2172.64s)]
*  to help this help out? I mean, I think as the president said, they need an enormous amount of [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2176.7999999999997s)]
*  capacity. In the near term, they need probably, do need security assistance, military assistance, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2183.68s)]
*  intelligence and information sharing. I mean, this is an incredible amount of violence happening [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2193.3599999999997s)]
*  not that far south of our border. He's right. We play some role in. The demand for these drugs [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2199.2s)]
*  is in the U.S. and in Europe. Oftentimes, it's even more so the case in Mexico, but weapons from the [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2204.8799999999997s)]
*  U.S. where weapons are readily available can make their way down there. And so we have some [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2211.36s)]
*  responsibility here. And if you look at the degree to which we put resources into the Middle East, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2216.56s)]
*  I'm not suggesting we should go to war in Ecuador. We shouldn't. But our bandwidth should definitely [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2223.2000000000003s)]
*  move down there. And you can make a big difference with that kind of capacity building in the near [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2229.28s)]
*  term. I think it's best if it's not just the U.S. And I think you heard him indicate that if you have [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2235.04s)]
*  countries from across Latin America, as well as European countries, kind of working collectively [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2241.36s)]
*  under some initiative to provide security assistance, to try to crack down on demand [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2246.2400000000002s)]
*  and where the shipping goes and the gangs on the other side in Europe or the U.S. that are helping [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2252.0s)]
*  facilitate this, you need that kind of effort to kind of turn the tide and create a sense of [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2257.1200000000003s)]
*  order and normalcy. I think part of what's happened in Ecuador is because you had politicians, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2262.0s)]
*  especially after that assassination, who didn't kind of roll over to the gangs' demand, they say, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2266.08s)]
*  we're just going to turn up the heat until you bow to our pressure. And that's a dangerous [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2271.7599999999998s)]
*  dynamic because you either could get essentially a narco state or you get a bukele, like a guy in [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2277.4399999999996s)]
*  El Salvador is like, you know what? All right, fine. We're just going to imprison everybody [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2285.2799999999997s)]
*  arbitrarily and probably violate their human rights and throw out the laws. And the public [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2288.96s)]
*  probably wants that. If you don't want there to be a strongman or a narco state, you need a kind [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2294.3999999999996s)]
*  of multilateral initiative to turn the tide on this. Yeah, you had two very important points. I [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2300.0s)]
*  think one is absolutely a regional problem. I mean, Ecuador is not producing cocaine. It's [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2305.2s)]
*  coming from Colombia or Peru, but basically they have a dollarized country, so it's easier to buy [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2309.84s)]
*  and sell it. And also the cocaine is transiting through Ecuador to these ports and getting shipped [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2315.12s)]
*  out. But the bukele comparison in El Salvador is very important because basically what we're [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2320.96s)]
*  talking about now in Ecuador is militarizing law enforcement. Nuboa designated 22 gangs as terrorist [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2326.72s)]
*  organizations. He's authorized the military to combat them. In the past, he has talked about [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2333.4399999999996s)]
*  admiring bukele who has basically fought gang violence by throwing everyone who happens to be [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2338.3199999999997s)]
*  in the wrong place at the wrong time into prison. And as a result- Or is related to gang members. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2344.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And has like a 90% approval rating. That is not a good outcome either. It's an intolerable [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2349.8399999999997s)]
*  level of violence, but also you don't want this police state. It's a hard as hell problem. I mean, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2354.96s)]
*  the US did this initiative over a couple of decades in Colombia, plan Colombia, that on the one hand [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2360.2400000000002s)]
*  did help secure Colombia and lead to a renaissance in places like Medellin, but also had human rights [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2366.08s)]
*  overreach. So it's calibrating this as hard, but I mean, if you don't try, you leave that kind of [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2372.56s)]
*  binary and between total autocracy and total narco state, and that's worth trying to avoid. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2378.08s)]
*  Yes, for sure. Let's turn to Guatemala where there was another wild scene. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2385.28s)]
*  It was crazy. Yeah. So Bernardo Arrivalo was supposed to be sworn into office as president [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2389.12s)]
*  on Sunday afternoon, but his political opponents in Congress pulled like a January 6th basically. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2393.52s)]
*  They did almost everything they could to prevent it from happening. And he actually managed to delay [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2398.72s)]
*  the ceremony by about 10 hours. So he was not sworn in until early Monday morning. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2402.72s)]
*  It took Arrivalo supporters threatening to storm the Capitol. It took a strong public push from the [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2409.12s)]
*  United States to finally get it done. Our friend Samantha Power, I think, led the delegation down [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2414.9599999999996s)]
*  to Guatemala for his inauguration. So look, this wasn't, it's been a rough couple of months for [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2419.3599999999997s)]
*  Arrivalo. There was an alleged assassination plot back in the summer between the first round of his [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2425.3599999999997s)]
*  election and the runoff. There were rumors that his vice president might be arrested to prevent [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2430.96s)]
*  his swearing in from happening. His political party got suspended for a while. And before that, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2435.36s)]
*  a number of other opposition candidates were disqualified from running. So it's not been a [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2440.4s)]
*  fair election process. There's this entrenched conservative establishment that really pulled [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2445.04s)]
*  all the stops to try to prevent it from achieving power. Despite all of that, Arrivalo won by more [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2449.52s)]
*  than 20 points in the election back in August. He will be the most progressive president in the [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2454.96s)]
*  country's history. But this battle to get sworn in, I think, is a pretty good indicator of how [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2458.8s)]
*  hard it will be to govern. His party has very little control of Congress, very little power in [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2463.28s)]
*  Congress. His opponents in Congress have already taken steps to curb his powers, including how much [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2467.92s)]
*  he can spend. And he ran on a platform promising to curb corruption and fight poverty. So he's [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2472.0s)]
*  going to need all the help he can get. The US took a number of steps to ensure that he was ultimately [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2478.2400000000002s)]
*  sworn in. The Biden team sanctioned allies of the former president. They imposed visa restrictions [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2484.4s)]
*  on more than 100 members of the Guatemalan Congress for undermining democracy. And a lot of [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2490.48s)]
*  activists in Guatemala actually credit President Biden for avoiding what would have been a coup. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2495.84s)]
*  This seems like a pretty big win for the Biden team that will probably never get covered in the [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2501.84s)]
*  US. But it is like an impressive piece of diplomacy. Well, they also were involved [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2505.84s)]
*  around the election when there were efforts to kind of get this guy out of the contest. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2510.88s)]
*  So there's been a sustained focus on Guatemala in trying to fortify basically the democratic [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2516.7200000000003s)]
*  process. And this globalization of January 6th is the latest chapter. I think in the long run, [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2524.0s)]
*  too, what you want to be doing is empowering institutions and civil society within Guatemala. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2529.6800000000003s)]
*  So it's not always like the US coming in heavy handed. They deserve a lot of credit. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2536.4s)]
*  Over time, what you'd like to see is that capacity to resist this kind of corrupt, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2542.56s)]
*  sclerotic establishment trying to reassert itself. You want to be building the capacity [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2548.96s)]
*  in the country to do that. And so there's a lot of good work that's been done, a lot of more work [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2554.48s)]
*  to be done. Yeah. And reminder, the US has a terrible history in Guatemala. CIA engineered a [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2559.1200000000003s)]
*  coup in the 50s. The US backed a brutal military dictatorship in the 80s. Arvalo's father is a [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2564.4s)]
*  former president, Juan Jose Arvalo. He had to go into exile in Latin America for a while. So [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2569.36s)]
*  his son was raised in Chile, Mexico, and Venezuela. One last weird thing on this, Ben, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2573.44s)]
*  you and I both noticed that Trump's former acting head of intelligence, Rick Grinnell, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2578.1600000000003s)]
*  was apparently down... Former special envoy to Serbia or something. Yeah. He was in Guatemala [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2584.56s)]
*  the day before the swearing in, the day of maybe meeting with the outgoing president. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2592.56s)]
*  He's good at January 6th. Why? Because he's a January 6th enthusiast. It really bears watching [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2597.2799999999997s)]
*  because there's this globalization of... In Guatemala, it's not even the far right. It's [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2603.68s)]
*  just corrupt assholes who don't like the peaceful transfer of power. And the fact that these Trumpies [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2609.84s)]
*  show up... You had Jason Miller, another Trumpy guy, probably Grinnell. I didn't bother to notice, [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2615.92s)]
*  but down in Brazil, helping Bolsonaro. You've got Grinnell showing up in Guatemala. He's actually [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2622.08s)]
*  turned up in the Balkans in support of pro-Russian nationalists. There is a scary... The scary thing [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2628.16s)]
*  about this is comical when you see it on social media, but if Trump wins, Rick Grinnell will [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2635.12s)]
*  probably be a very senior official. He'll probably be trying to put us in some gulag or something. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2640.0s)]
*  So we can laugh about it now, but it's a taste of this is actually the kind of people that would [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2645.7599999999998s)]
*  be making US foreign policy. The kind of people that are supporting January 6th style efforts to [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2651.2s)]
*  prevent the peaceful transition of power to a man who won a free and fair election in Guatemala. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2655.9199999999996s)]
*  That's depressing. And it's a reason for whatever you don't like about the Biden foreign policy, [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2661.2s)]
*  it just shows you the enormous gulf between what a Trump foreign policy would be and this. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2666.7999999999997s)]
*  It could be a lot worse. If you think Victor Orban is a good guy, Donald Trump is the man for you. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2672.7999999999997s)]
*  So let's do an update on the Taiwanese election. Last week, you had Emily Wu on to do a preview and [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2678.32s)]
*  talk about the candidates and the stakes. Now the results are in. William Lai will be Taiwan's new [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2683.1200000000003s)]
*  president. He is the former vice president and the candidate from the Democratic Progressive Party, [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2687.6800000000003s)]
*  which had been in power for the last eight years. Senors have rebuked to China, which is accused of [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2692.0s)]
*  trying to influence the election. And they called William Lai a troublemaker and a separatist in the [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2696.56s)]
*  lead up to the vote. What do we need to know about this election? Anything surprise you and what are [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2700.96s)]
*  the stakes here? It's a really important result. So the DPP is the party that traditionally has been [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2704.56s)]
*  both more pro-democracy and progressive inside of Taiwan, because the other major party, the KMT, [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2711.04s)]
*  had been associated with the single party dictatorship that governed Taiwan until the [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2717.2s)]
*  late 90s. But they've also been seen as the more pro-independence party. They don't outwardly say [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2720.96s)]
*  we want to declare independence, but they basically don't accept one China as the principle [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2727.04s)]
*  through which they would negotiate with Beijing. They kind of de facto, and William Lai's position [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2732.64s)]
*  is, well, we don't have to declare independence because we kind of already are in a country. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2738.08s)]
*  And so it is a rebuke to China that William Lai was elected. It is an indication of [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2743.2s)]
*  where Taiwanese are going, that they see themselves as a matter of identity as Taiwanese and less as [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2749.92s)]
*  Chinese. It is a show that the Chinese play of like disinformation campaigns and intimidation [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2754.7999999999997s)]
*  did not affect Taiwanese voters. And Emily talked about this bit. People are kind of accustomed to [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2762.16s)]
*  living with fear even if they don't like it. And look, he has moderated his tone. He used to be [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2766.48s)]
*  seen as a little bit more of a rabble rouser than the previous president Tsai Ing-wen. But he said [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2772.24s)]
*  kind of the right things in this campaign about he's not looking to be provocative or declare [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2777.52s)]
*  independence. And the formulation I talked about it was status quo is good because we get to kind [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2782.3999999999996s)]
*  of do our own thing. But what it means is that a window is opening up here. The window in which [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2786.56s)]
*  analysts think that the Chinese military will be quote unquote ready to invade Taiwan is 2027. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2792.96s)]
*  Right. And so William Lai getting elected, if the KMT guy had won, probably would have meant [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2797.92s)]
*  tensions go down and there's some negotiation. It probably wouldn't have led anywhere, but it just [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2802.64s)]
*  would have parked it a little bit more. This does mean that there's kind of this window of William [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2807.04s)]
*  Lai's term in office in the next few years where this is an issue that is going to have to be [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2811.2799999999997s)]
*  managed and there are going to be provocations and things that Chinese do to try to intimidate. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2815.92s)]
*  And the US is going to have to calibrate its own statements. And already they sent Jim Steinberg [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2819.84s)]
*  and Steve Hadley to kind of- To former senior officials. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2826.2400000000002s)]
*  To former senior officials from Clinton and Bush, yeah. To go and I guess just be high level [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2830.88s)]
*  delegation, but not active officials. It's this game we play where it's not sitting government [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2838.4s)]
*  officials who go, but it's former ones who carry messages. Anyway, it's a preview of the fact that [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2842.8s)]
*  this is going to be an issue and there are going to be tensions around it. I think it's an [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2847.76s)]
*  understandable result because if I was Taiwanese, I wouldn't trust negotiations with China over [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2855.36s)]
*  anything because the Chinese just kind of essentially want to swallow up Taiwan. But I think in the US [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2861.52s)]
*  election, for instance, Biden's position is that we would come to Taiwan's defense militarily. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2866.6400000000003s)]
*  Trump is kind of been on all sides of the issue. It just means this is going to be something [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2872.16s)]
*  that matters. Yeah, definitely matters. Speaking of issues that are bubbling up in the region. So [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2876.96s)]
*  not so good news that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said that his country will no longer [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2883.52s)]
*  pursue reconciliation with South Korea. That basically means that the decades long official [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2889.2799999999997s)]
*  policy of unifying the Korean peninsula is now officially dead. North Korea also abolished the [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2895.2799999999997s)]
*  key government agencies that have been tasked with managing relations with South Korea. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2900.96s)]
*  And on January 1st, Kim Jong-un said that his military should, quote, thoroughly annihilate [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2904.4s)]
*  the United States and South Korea if provoked. But then we're pretty used to genocidal rhetoric [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2908.7200000000003s)]
*  from South, from North Korea at this point. What do you make of them officially abandoning [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2914.4s)]
*  reconciliation and reunification? I think what I make of it is that, yeah, like on the one hand, [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2919.28s)]
*  okay, it's not like he was really pursuing reunification, so I don't overstate it. But [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2924.56s)]
*  what I make of it is I think Kim Jong-un feels in a particularly strong position right now. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2928.32s)]
*  He's got this relationship with Russia where Russia's actually relying on him to supply all [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2935.52s)]
*  this artillery and he's probably getting God knows what in return. His nuclear program has advanced [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2939.52s)]
*  leaps and bounds, particularly since the famous Singapore summit with Donald Trump. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2945.04s)]
*  He got fourth in Iowa. Is he the Bigsby guy? [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2949.92s)]
*  He did pretty good. No, he didn't. He beat Asa Hashman. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2953.68s)]
*  The Chinese who used to kind of occasionally work with the US to put pressure on the North Koreans. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2956.96s)]
*  Since the US-China relationship has gotten frostier, the Chinese are much kind of more [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2962.56s)]
*  outwardly friendly of the North Koreans, much less willing to put pressure on them. So I think what [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2966.72s)]
*  it shows is this guy's like, wait a second, I'm not going anywhere. I'm pretty comfortable. I've [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2972.08s)]
*  got this nuclear missile program. I got my friends, the Russian and the Chinese, the international [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2976.72s)]
*  communities such as it is can no longer pressure me like they could a decade ago. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2980.88s)]
*  And so yeah, I'm riding high. I don't have to pretend that I want to make up with these guys. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2985.12s)]
*  And maybe my best friend who I exchanged love letters with Donald Trump could be President [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2989.84s)]
*  of the United States in a year. And so again, watch this space in Asia because the risk, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=2994.0s)]
*  the better he feels, the more I feel like there could be some provocation from him to start [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3001.36s)]
*  messing with the South Korea. Yeah, absolutely. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3007.52s)]
*  The UN's International Court of Justice has been hearing testimony in South Africa's case against [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3009.84s)]
*  Israel for allegedly violating the Genocide Convention. Joining me today to talk about the [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3013.6800000000003s)]
*  legal details and the international implications is Ona Hathaway, the founder and director of the [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3017.92s)]
*  Yale Law School Center for Global Legal Challenges. Ona, thank you so much for doing the show. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3023.2000000000003s)]
*  Thanks so much for having me. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3027.1200000000003s)]
*  So can we start with some basics? Can you help listeners understand the difference between the [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3028.4s)]
*  International Court of Justice or the ICJ and the International Criminal Court or ICC? They [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3033.68s)]
*  might be more familiar with the latter. Yeah. So the International Court of Justice is a court [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3039.7599999999998s)]
*  that's an organ of the United Nations. So when the United Nations was created in 1945, [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3045.68s)]
*  at the end of World War II, it was one of the main organs of the Security Council, [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3051.68s)]
*  the General Assembly and the International Court of Justice. Those are kind of the three main [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3055.7599999999998s)]
*  organs of the United Nations. And every state that is party to the United Nations Charter [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3059.92s)]
*  is also party to the Charter of the International Court of Justice. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3065.92s)]
*  And the International Court of Justice only hears cases between states. So the only person [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3069.52s)]
*  who can bring a case is a state and the only person who can be sued or the only entity that [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3074.7200000000003s)]
*  can be a state that a case can be brought against is a state. So here the case we're going to be [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3080.0s)]
*  talking about is South Africa versus Israel. Now the International Criminal Court is different. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3084.88s)]
*  It's much newer. It was set up in 2001 and it's a criminal court. It's what it sounds like. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3090.4s)]
*  And while states are party to it, what they're doing when they become party to the International [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3095.36s)]
*  Criminal Court is they're saying, you have jurisdiction court over my citizens if they [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3100.0s)]
*  commit the crimes that are within the jurisdiction of the court or if crimes are committed on my [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3105.52s)]
*  territory. And that's criminal law jurisdiction. So it's jurisdiction over individuals. So there [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3110.16s)]
*  was indictment of Putin, for instance. So these are criminal cases that they then get brought in [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3115.6s)]
*  the International Criminal Court against individual persons for international crimes. And they're [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3120.7999999999997s)]
*  prosecuted for those crimes and they can be locked up for those crimes if they're found guilty. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3125.8399999999997s)]
*  Fascinating. Okay. Very helpful. And so in this case, South Africa is asking the court to order [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3130.8799999999997s)]
*  an immediate end to Israel's military campaign in Gaza. My understanding is that these cases [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3136.32s)]
*  can take a long time to adjudicate and that while these rulings may be legally binding, [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3143.44s)]
*  there's not necessarily an enforcement mechanism for them. Is that accurate? And if so, what do [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3148.0s)]
*  you think South Africa is hoping to achieve here? Well, it's partially accurate. So in the narrow [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3153.44s)]
*  sense, it's accurate. So this case is going to, has been brought by South Africa against Israel. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3158.88s)]
*  And this initial stage is the provisional measure stage. So what they're asking for is basically, [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3165.44s)]
*  look, this case is going to take a while, it's probably going to take years. And if you think [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3170.96s)]
*  we even have a plausible case, please order Israel to stop doing certain things that are going to [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3174.96s)]
*  basically mean that the case is meaningless by the time it's decided. So they're asking for things [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3180.32s)]
*  like stop the war. I don't think they're going to get that full measure. But they're also asking [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3184.96s)]
*  for things like access to humanitarian assistance or asking for preservation of evidence. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3189.28s)]
*  The court could also order something more modest, like stop committing, stop killing quite so many [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3195.84s)]
*  civilians in the conduct of the war. They may not say stop the war altogether. So let's say they [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3201.6800000000003s)]
*  issue that order. Let's say they issue an order that says you have to provide more humanitarian [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3207.1200000000003s)]
*  assistance or you have to allow more humanitarian assistance in, you have to stop screening things [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3211.44s)]
*  at the border, the bottlenecks have to be let up, there has to be significantly more aid. That's [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3216.88s)]
*  something I think is a pretty likely order if the court finds that these allegations are plausible. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3220.56s)]
*  And Israel says, no, we don't want to do that. Well, there's a number of things. So the formal [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3226.4s)]
*  mechanism is referred to the Security Council. That's not going to go anywhere because the US [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3232.56s)]
*  would almost certainly veto an enforcement measure. So we can sort of take that off the table. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3237.92s)]
*  But once the court says, look, we think there's a possible violation of the Genocide Convention here. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3244.0s)]
*  And South Africa has said enough here to convince us that there might be a violation [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3250.6400000000003s)]
*  and that we're ordering this to prevent a kind of prejudice of the situation on the ground and that [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3256.2400000000002s)]
*  this is necessary to kind of preserve the facts and not allow genocide to continue to unfold. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3262.96s)]
*  What that does is it triggers the obligations of everybody else. So it's not just South Africa [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3269.3599999999997s)]
*  and Israel that are party to the Genocide Convention. The US is party to the Genocide [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3275.2s)]
*  Convention. Hundreds of over 190 states are party to the Genocide Convention. So all of those states [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3279.3599999999997s)]
*  now are on notice that the court thinks there's a possible or a plausible case that there's [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3287.7599999999998s)]
*  violations of the Genocide Convention. And as parties to the Genocide Convention, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3293.6s)]
*  they have an obligation not to assist and aid genocide, but they also have an affirmative [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3298.0s)]
*  obligation under the Genocide Convention to prevent genocide. So it creates this cascade, [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3302.96s)]
*  potentially, of effects on other states. And particularly thinking about the US, [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3309.6s)]
*  for the US to continue to provide aid and assistance, particularly military assistance [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3315.6s)]
*  to Israel, once that decision comes down, it's going to be a lot harder. And that's going to [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3319.44s)]
*  be faced a lot of challenge if in fact that ruling does come down. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3323.76s)]
*  Got it. That's really interesting. So it's a lot more than just sort of naming and shaming and all [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3327.44s)]
*  the media coverage around this case. There are some real legal implications that I want to get [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3331.84s)]
*  into later because you wrote a really interesting piece about this for Just Security. So let's take [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3335.92s)]
*  a listen to a clip of testimony from the South African legal team. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3340.7200000000003s)]
*  On the basis of the current figures, on average, 247 Palestinians are being killed and are at risk [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3345.28s)]
*  of being killed each day, many of them literally blown to pieces. They include 48 mothers each day, [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3354.88s)]
*  two every hour. And over 117 children each day, leading UNICEF to call Israel's actions [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3366.16s)]
*  a war on children. Entire multi-generational families will be obliterated. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3375.8399999999997s)]
*  And yet more Palestinian children will become WCNSF, Wounded Child, No Surviving Family, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3383.2799999999997s)]
*  the terrible new acronym born out of Israel's genocidal assault on the Palestinian population [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3394.8799999999997s)]
*  in Gaza. So, you know, pretty devastating description of some of the outcomes of this war. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3401.04s)]
*  I think the key thing for listeners to understand is that to prove the crime of genocide under [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3407.04s)]
*  international law, you need to show that in this case, Israel acted with genocidal intent. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3413.3599999999997s)]
*  To make that argument, South Africa put forward a series of quotes from Israeli officials, [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3419.4399999999996s)]
*  among other evidence, including a quote from Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, where in a letter [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3423.84s)]
*  to soldiers, he invokes a biblical passage that says, quote, spare no one, but kill alike men [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3428.4s)]
*  and women, infants and sucklings, oxen and sheep, camels and asses, end quote. Can you talk a bit [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3433.44s)]
*  about the barrier, the threshold that you need to reach to prove genocidal intent and what you make [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3439.44s)]
*  of the evidence presented thus far? Yeah. So as you said, there's not just a requirement that you [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3446.0s)]
*  show acts. So there are genocidal acts that you have to show and that can include killing, making [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3450.8s)]
*  life intolerable or impossible in the Gaza Strip. Those are the kinds of things that might constitute [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3457.52s)]
*  acts, but it also requires what we call specific intent. So specific intent to destroy a group in [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3463.36s)]
*  horror in part. So they have to show not just that they did these things, that they've killed a lot [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3470.8s)]
*  of people. The South African team went through all the various facts around the killing more than [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3476.0s)]
*  23,000 civilians and many people starving and all that. So that's the act part. But then you have to [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3484.48s)]
*  show that that was done with intent to destroy a group or in horror in part. And that is a very [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3490.96s)]
*  high threshold. And so to try and meet that, what they've done here is to use statements from [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3496.08s)]
*  members of the Israeli government, even from pop stars. So part of that is to show not just [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3503.04s)]
*  genocidal intent, but the failure to prevent incitement to genocide, because that's also [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3512.48s)]
*  a violation of the Genocide Convention is not just to commit the genocidal acts yourself, [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3519.12s)]
*  but to incite genocide by others. So they are using a lot of these statements. Now part of it [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3523.8399999999997s)]
*  is interesting at this stage, because we're so preliminary, we're really, really early on, [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3530.3199999999997s)]
*  they're sort of having to use all this public evidence. Once the case ultimately gets to the [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3533.8399999999997s)]
*  merits, assuming it ever does get to the merits, they will then likely have more information, [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3537.92s)]
*  kind of more information about kind of internal conversations with the government that might [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3545.6s)]
*  provide further evidence of specific intent. But that's what they're trying to do there, [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3550.64s)]
*  because that really is an extraordinarily high threshold. And it's part of the reason genocide [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3554.64s)]
*  is so difficult to prove. Yeah, I mean, so I wasn't at the White House at the time, but my [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3559.2s)]
*  co-host Ben Rhodes was when the Obama administration found that ISIS had the intent to commit genocide [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3564.3999999999996s)]
*  against the Yezidi people. And I think they based that determination off literal documents that were [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3570.56s)]
*  like, we are going to eradicate this group of people. And I'm wondering how you sort out in a [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3575.6s)]
*  court of law, a document like that, which is pretty cut and dry with statements, which, you know, [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3580.7999999999997s)]
*  look, might be hyperbole, right? After a horrific moment of trauma for a country, [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3587.2s)]
*  for a population, for leaders who tend to be boastful and want to show how tough they are, [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3593.04s)]
*  how do you sort out what is actual genocidal intent there? Well, this is exactly the challenge. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3598.88s)]
*  And this is what Israel was sort of pointing to. They were saying, look, [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3604.48s)]
*  what South Africa is doing is cherry picking. They're cherry picking a bunch of kind of random [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3608.3199999999997s)]
*  statements. They're taking them out of context and that this doesn't demonstrate intent. These [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3612.72s)]
*  are sort of various people kind of randomly picked out these various statements. And as you say, [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3619.12s)]
*  kind of, you know, political hyperbole, they're not really intended to incite genocide or to, [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3623.2s)]
*  they're not necessarily indicative of genocidal intent. And in fact, Israel said, look, [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3629.68s)]
*  you're ignoring all these statements that we also gave that said, you know, don't kill civilians [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3633.8399999999997s)]
*  unnecessarily. And we're trying to be cautious about killing lots of civilians, you know, so they [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3637.8399999999997s)]
*  sort of tried to balance the scales a bit by showing some of those comments on the other side. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3642.4s)]
*  You know, so that's, I think, really going to be a sticking point for the court here is to decide, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3647.92s)]
*  you know, is there enough here that they think that there's, you don't have to, they don't have [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3652.0s)]
*  to decide here that there is genocide. They have to decide that there could be genocide, right? So [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3657.84s)]
*  that's the other thing at this early stage, they don't have to sort of make a final determination [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3662.7200000000003s)]
*  the merits. The question is, is this capable of falling within the provisions of the Genocide [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3666.72s)]
*  Convention? So is there enough here that we think that there is likely to be proven or there's a [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3671.12s)]
*  possibility that it'll be proven down the line that any of these acts constitute a violation of [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3676.64s)]
*  the Convention? But I think you've pointed to exactly the really hard part here. And, you know, [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3680.56s)]
*  the question is whether those statements combined with intent inferred from acts, you know, so the [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3686.3999999999996s)]
*  South Africans also were trying to show, look, you know, there's huge numbers of civilian [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3693.28s)]
*  casualties that don't seem to be justified by military necessity, that also starvation [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3698.96s)]
*  of significant portions of the population, inadequate access of basic, you know, human [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3707.6800000000003s)]
*  needs, water, fuel, access to food and the like, you know, military medical supplies, you know, [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3713.1200000000003s)]
*  these things, that was also an important part of the case. And part of what they're trying to show [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3720.16s)]
*  there is not just the statements that demonstrate intent, but that the kind of reaction and the way [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3724.0s)]
*  in which so many people are being killed and the sort of the way in which it's life has essentially [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3729.12s)]
*  become intolerable in the Gaza Strip is meant to communicate something about intent as well. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3733.92s)]
*  And so those are the various ways in which they were trying to make their case. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3738.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Let's listen to a clip of the Israeli counter argument. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3741.44s)]
*  The genocide convention was not designed to address the brutal impact of intensive hostilities [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3745.04s)]
*  on the civilian population, even when the use of force raises, quote, very serious issues of [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3751.68s)]
*  international law and involves an enormous suffering and continuing loss of life, end quote. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3758.88s)]
*  The convention was set apart to address a malevolent crime of the most exceptional severity. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3766.8s)]
*  We live at a time when words are cheap. In an age of social media and identity politics, [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3773.44s)]
*  the temptation to reach for the most outrageous term to vilify and demonize has become for many [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3780.56s)]
*  irresistible. But if there is a place where words should still matter, where truth should still [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3788.48s)]
*  matter, it is surely a court of law. What do you make of that argument that [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3795.68s)]
*  essentially the genocide convention was not intended to address the brutality of war? [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3801.28s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I think that what they're trying to do there, what the advocates were trying to do is [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3806.7200000000003s)]
*  say, look, genocide is something else, right? Genocide has this resonant power, this term has [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3810.96s)]
*  this resonant power, and it is a very distinctive kind of crime. And I think part of this is an [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3818.1600000000003s)]
*  effort to respond to the, for what many is this extraordinary pain of Israel being accused of [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3824.72s)]
*  committing genocide when the convention that they're being accused of violating is a convention that [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3834.24s)]
*  was passed in large part in response to the Holocaust. And so this kind of historical [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3840.08s)]
*  connection between the genocide convention they're being accused of violating and Israel and the [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3846.7999999999997s)]
*  founding of Israel, I think is part of why this has provoked such an emotional reaction from [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3853.12s)]
*  Israelis and this outrage really from Israelis from the top down. And I think that that's part [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3859.92s)]
*  of what he's trying to say is genocide is something very specific. It's a certain kind of crime. It's [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3869.3599999999997s)]
*  not just a term to be kind of thrown around lately. It is one of the most horrific crimes [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3873.8399999999997s)]
*  imaginable and suggests that what's happening here is genocide is inaccurate, I think is the [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3881.7599999999998s)]
*  claim that they're trying to make. Now, of course, the South Africans are responding that, well, it [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3888.16s)]
*  may not look exactly like the genocides of the past, but the claim they're making is that in fact, [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3892.48s)]
*  they are engaging in a violation of the genocide convention. It may not be precisely the same as [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3898.16s)]
*  these historic genocides, but that it has, that it meets the legal definition. That's at least [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3905.12s)]
*  the claim. Yeah. I think you bring up something very important, an important piece of context [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3910.88s)]
*  here, which is that there's a lot of bad actors in this world that like to accuse Israel or often [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3914.88s)]
*  just Jews generally of committing genocide. There's the great replacement theory that we've heard [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3919.6s)]
*  about so much on Tucker Carlson's show and other right-wing media outlets. There's all kinds of [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3924.4s)]
*  baseless, crazy conspiracy theories that Jews were pushing vaccines as part of a strategy to [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3929.76s)]
*  exterminate or sterilize non-Jews. Israel was accused of committing genocide in Gaza [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3935.52s)]
*  long before this current conflict started. And it is clear, I think, from that history that some [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3942.0s)]
*  people just want to turn this singular evil in history, the Holocaust, like the greatest trauma [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3948.24s)]
*  ever experienced by the Jewish people against them. And I'm wondering if you think that context, [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3953.92s)]
*  that history is relevant or will be discussed as part of this trial, or this is just more of like [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3959.92s)]
*  a legalistic determination. I think history is so heavy in this case. And there's no doubt that it [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3967.6800000000003s)]
*  will play a massive role. I think it's heavy in a variety of ways. So in the ways that you've just [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3973.44s)]
*  described, I mean, this history of genocide and the Genocide Convention, its connection to Israel, [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3978.48s)]
*  it's really important that Israel was able to name one of the ad hoc judges. So each side got [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3987.44s)]
*  to name an ad hoc judge. And the judge that was named by Israel is Justice Aharon Barak, who [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=3994.32s)]
*  himself was a victim of the Holocaust. His family was persecuted. And he narrowly escaped with his [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4001.28s)]
*  life from Lithuania and immigrated to Israel. And I think he's been a critic of this government. So [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4009.52s)]
*  it was an interesting choice. I mean, he was sort of the one behind the opposition to the reform of [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4017.12s)]
*  the court and has been under siege in Israel in some ways because of his opposition to the right [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4022.96s)]
*  wing government. So it's a really interesting choice to appoint him. But I think they did so in [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4029.36s)]
*  part because he is a kind of this voice of history. He brings this weight of history and [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4034.48s)]
*  this reminder that Israel was founded out of this history of a genocide. And so there's no escaping [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4041.28s)]
*  it. On the other hand, there's also history on South Africa's side. I mean, I think part of the [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4051.92s)]
*  argument South Africa is making here for why they're bringing this case is they feel this [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4056.32s)]
*  burden of history because of their history of apartheid, because of the persecution of the [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4061.04s)]
*  significant part of their population for much of its history, and this treating groups of people [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4066.56s)]
*  because of the color of their skin as second class citizens and making their lives intolerable, [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4075.52s)]
*  that they have this kind of burden of history as well to speak for the Palestinian people who they [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4080.8s)]
*  see as sort of existing in a similar position. So I think on both sides, we're seeing history as [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4086.08s)]
*  playing this really powerful role in the case, and there's going to be no escaping it. I mean, [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4091.12s)]
*  it will absolutely be an important part of this case, and as it should be. I mean, that's part of [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4097.44s)]
*  the conversation here is going to be not only what's happening now, but how does that fit into the [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4103.44s)]
*  arc of history and how do we understand the events that are unfolding now and does it fit [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4108.72s)]
*  the legal definition of genocide given all of that? [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4113.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's a really good point. Wow. I mean, talk about complicating an already complicated [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4117.2s)]
*  case. I mean, you bring in apartheid and the Holocaust and all that history there. It's just [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4122.88s)]
*  unbelievable. Last question for you. So you wrote this piece at Just Security about the potential [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4127.5199999999995s)]
*  ramifications of the case, not just in terms of the current conflict that's happening in Gaza, but [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4132.0s)]
*  really in terms of the broader US Israel relationship going forward. Can you help us [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4136.719999999999s)]
*  understand those implications? Yeah. I mean, I think this is really challenging for the United [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4142.24s)]
*  States. It has been a steadfast ally of Israel's for as long as I can remember. And Biden personally [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4146.639999999999s)]
*  is deeply committed to Israel. He has personal connections in Israel. He's since his days as a [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4157.36s)]
*  senator has been a strong supporter of Israel. And so I think this is really coming from the top, [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4164.08s)]
*  this sort of unequivocal support for Israel. But I think the challenge that we're running into is [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4169.44s)]
*  that Israel is waging this war in a way that's so brutal and killing so many civilians. And that has [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4174.32s)]
*  ignited a regional war. We're already seeing, obviously, the Houthis claiming they're acting [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4183.44s)]
*  on behalf of the Palestinians attacking US ships and other Western ships. And the US now retaliating [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4190.08s)]
*  along with UK and Yemen and the US putting together a big aid package to continue to support [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4198.24s)]
*  Israel. But meanwhile, Israel being accused of committing a violation of the genocide convention. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4203.84s)]
*  And that's not even dealing with another set of problems with this, which is whether Israel is [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4208.96s)]
*  violating the Geneva Conventions as well. That's not in front of the court, the International Court [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4214.96s)]
*  of Justice, because International Court of Justice doesn't have jurisdiction over the Geneva [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4220.16s)]
*  Conventions, but the International Criminal Court, which we talked about earlier, does. And it's in [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4224.24s)]
*  the process of investigating possible violations of the Geneva Conventions in Palestine and by [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4229.76s)]
*  Palestinians. So the initial attack on October 7 by Hamas is within the scope of that investigation [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4236.16s)]
*  as well. And so that puts us in a very hot spot because states not only have an obligation not to [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4241.04s)]
*  engage in violations of these international laws, but not to aid and assist the violation of [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4248.5599999999995s)]
*  the genocide convention or the Geneva Conventions. And the Geneva Conventions also have a special [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4254.639999999999s)]
*  obligation under Common Article 1 to ensure respect. So not only to respect yourself, [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4259.44s)]
*  but ensure respect by others of the Geneva Convention. So the US in having this full-throated [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4264.88s)]
*  support for Israel is now kind of, I think, realizing that maybe that was a little bit of [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4274.0s)]
*  a mistake. And they're sort of trying to backpedal a bit, not backpedal in terms of support for [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4280.24s)]
*  Israel, but saying, we're trying to encourage Israel to wage the war in a way that's more [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4285.36s)]
*  cautious with regard to civilian casualties, but not really pulling out the threat that it [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4293.599999999999s)]
*  would potentially pull out, which is we're not going to continue to provide aid unless you do. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4300.88s)]
*  And I think the US is going to be, as this war continues to unfold, if it continues to unfold the [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4305.6s)]
*  way that it has, the US is actually facing its own legal jeopardy because it is actually in [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4310.0s)]
*  violation of international law if it's assisting these violations of international law. And if it [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4316.72s)]
*  continues to provide aid, provides new aid, knowing what's happening, that is actually [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4321.52s)]
*  pretty clearly a violation of the Geneva Conventions itself, as well as a violation of the [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4327.360000000001s)]
*  Genocide Convention. So I think this ought to be giving lawyers in the administration some serious [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4331.92s)]
*  heartburn. I think they really ought to be raising questions about whether we can continue to provide [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4337.12s)]
*  this aid without conditions. And in fact, I think probably we can't. And I think we're probably going [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4343.12s)]
*  to have to really think about how do we ensure that Israel is not going to use the weapons we're [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4348.64s)]
*  providing, the aid we're providing to engage in clear violations of international law. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4353.6s)]
*  Do you think that's why the administration keeps ducking questions about whether they're doing any [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4358.72s)]
*  kind of review of whether war crimes are being committed or saying Bernie Sanders legislation [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4363.04s)]
*  that he's putting before the Senate right now to try to put some very limited conditions on aid, [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4368.8s)]
*  it's not the right time, etc. They just don't want a legal record of having looked at these things [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4374.400000000001s)]
*  if this determination comes down? I think so, but it's so puzzling to me because that's not how we [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4379.04s)]
*  normally deal with the law, right? We don't normally sort of like blind ourselves to the [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4384.24s)]
*  problem or sort of close our eyes to the problem. Traditionally, lawyers try to anticipate the [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4388.88s)]
*  problems, not sort of ignore them. And so I worry that might be part of what's happening. And if that [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4395.599999999999s)]
*  is what's happening, I think that's not good. I think the lawyers ought to be really thinking [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4402.08s)]
*  carefully about how do we protect ourselves from being a violation of international law and our [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4406.32s)]
*  ability to encourage others to abide by international law in the future. I mean, it really does [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4412.24s)]
*  harm not only in this instance, but it really destroys our credibility going forward to try [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4417.36s)]
*  and encourage anybody else to abide by the rules if we're not abiding by the rules ourselves and [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4423.04s)]
*  we're not holding those that we're supporting to some of the most fundamental rules of international [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4427.679999999999s)]
*  legal order. So I think if they're avoiding it for that reason, and they may very well be, [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4433.5199999999995s)]
*  I think that's a really misguided decision. Yeah. I mean, I think maybe the take home for me, [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4439.84s)]
*  the take home for listeners is a genocide determination is a very high bar. We don't [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4443.76s)]
*  know if it will be met. That doesn't mean that war crimes aren't being committed. That doesn't [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4448.4800000000005s)]
*  mean that displacing Gazans wouldn't be ethnic cleansing, right? There's all sorts of other [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4452.96s)]
*  horrors that are happening regardless of whether we determine this as a genocide. So you don't have [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4458.4800000000005s)]
*  to call it a genocide to demand the administration stop to do some activism, to call your senator, [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4462.96s)]
*  to put pressure on the administration to condition aid, right? I mean, I think that's what's [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4469.84s)]
*  driving me a little insane. If we're being honest with the conversation online is like, if you don't [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4473.04s)]
*  say genocide, you aren't really against the war. No, this is like the most serious crime you could [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4477.04s)]
*  commit. It's going to be a high bar. Judges will determine that, but we all should be pressuring [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4481.68s)]
*  the administration to pressure the Israelis to commit to a ceasefire immediately. It's my takeaway. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4486.88s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I think you're right. And I do think I do worry a little bit that if, [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4493.68s)]
*  depending on what the court decides here, if they decide that the bar hasn't been met [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4497.84s)]
*  because it is such a high one, that there are credible allegations of violations of the [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4503.360000000001s)]
*  genocide convention such that they can grant provisional measures, that people read that as [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4508.400000000001s)]
*  like, oh, everything's fine. But that doesn't mean everything's fine. I mean, there's lots of other [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4512.88s)]
*  laws potentially being violated here. And the prosecutor of the ICC has been much slower to act. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4518.0s)]
*  And so, and traditionally is slow because he has to build a criminal case. And so we may not see [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4522.96s)]
*  that for a while. And so even if there is a decision against provisional measures here, [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4528.64s)]
*  that doesn't mean that there's clean hands. And it doesn't mean that there's not legal problems [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4534.16s)]
*  that we should be addressing. And even if there isn't, even if there aren't any laws being broken, [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4538.0s)]
*  it's still the case that so many civilians are suffering and so many civilians are being killed [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4543.6s)]
*  that there's a moral case to do something about that. So putting law to one side, I'm a lawyer [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4549.6s)]

*  today. That was absolutely fascinating and incredibly helpful to understand a thorny issue [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1jJUjLLc0&t=4565.68s)]
