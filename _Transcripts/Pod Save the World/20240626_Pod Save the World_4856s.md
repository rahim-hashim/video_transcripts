Video Description: Ben Rhodes is joined by guest host David Lammy, British MP and Shadow Foreign Secretary. They discuss the upcoming election in the UK on July 4th and how historic a Labour win by Keir Starmer would be, how to read into popular support for Nigel Farage and his far-right party, an election betting scandal from people within Rishi Sunak’s inner circle, and the key domestic and economic issues on the line. They also talk about David’s theory of “progressive realism” and how a Labour foreign policy would continue to advocate for unity on the war in Ukraine, pressure Hamas and Netanyahu to agree to a ceasefire, and what it would mean for David to represent his country as Foreign Secretary. Then, Ben touches on the arrival of a Kenyan police force in Haiti, Julian Assange’s release from prison, and speaks to New York Times reporter Ed Wong about his new book, “At the Edge of Empire: A Family's Reckoning with China”.

*  personal family history [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=129.96s)]

*  Thank you for having me on the part. It's great to be with you. Well, this is exciting [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=170.7s)]
*  We are in the homestretch of a campaign that feels feels much happier David than a lot of the campaigns happening around the world [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=174.94s)]
*  We have just over a week till July 4th an interesting choice by [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=184.66s)]
*  Rishi Sunak. It's not necessarily been a good date for British Prime Ministers in the past [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=189.54s)]
*  But that's when the election will be held in the UK [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=193.94s)]
*  We've been talking about this a lot [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=196.78s)]
*  The stakes of course are high the Labour Party could take power back from the Conservatives for the first time since [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=198.42s)]
*  1997 [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=205.7s)]
*  Before we get into you know [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=207.5s)]
*  The campaign and the issues David I just want to ask you how you doing like how are you feeling right now? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=209.66s)]
*  Just over a week out. Well, look, you know [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=214.85999999999999s)]
*  This is my eighth general election [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=216.98000000000002s)]
*  This last weekend passed I live in in politics for 24 years [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=221.22000000000003s)]
*  And the truth is if you're a Labour politician [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=227.3s)]
*  That's been around a while you get used to losing elections not winning [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=231.5s)]
*  And in fact we forget sometimes the Labour Party was only in power in the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=238.62s)]
*  20th century for 23 years [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=245.06s)]
*  We won under Clem Atlee after the Second World War [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=247.94s)]
*  We won under Harold Wilson [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=251.22s)]
*  And we won under Tony Blair. That's it. So if we pull this off [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=254.29999999999998s)]
*  It's a staggering victory for Keir Starmer and I say that because it's important to understand [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=260.74s)]
*  That the Labour Party at the last general election in 2019 [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=268.5s)]
*  Suffered its worst defeat since 1935 and so to pull off the rebound in just one electoral cycle [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=273.86s)]
*  Is a is a huge huge huge momentous moment with all credit to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=282.09999999999997s)]
*  Keir Starmer for the way he's changed the party around and reorientated towards the electorate [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=288.5s)]
*  Alright, so wait, that's a perfect segue and you didn't even know I was gonna do this [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=293.74s)]
*  But you came on this podcast after that Boris Johnson landslide in 2019 [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=297.58s)]
*  Everybody was everybody was super depressed. It felt like the Tories are gonna be in power forever [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=304.06s)]
*  You know and I asked you what does the Labour Party need to do to recover from this absolute wipeout? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=310.29999999999995s)]
*  And I'm gonna play a clip of what you said. Here we go [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=317.62s)]
*  What do you think is next for the Labour Party and how would you like to see the Labour Party? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=319.94s)]
*  Evolved have a better shot in the in the next election [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=325.54s)]
*  My view is the first thing is we must elect a leader that [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=329.06s)]
*  Looks like he or she is capable of being prime minister on day one [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=334.94s)]
*  and that is absolutely mandatory and that means that not just a leader that [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=340.18s)]
*  Makes the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=346.38s)]
*  Labor fold and those on the center-left and left feel good about themselves [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=347.78000000000003s)]
*  but someone who the country can look at and [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=353.7s)]
*  Instantly say yes, I can put my faith in that man or woman [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=357.18s)]
*  I mean not to give you credit here David because the election hasn't happened yet [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=361.24s)]
*  But so shortly after that you told me that the guy you were backing was Keir Starmer [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=365.1s)]
*  What was the you know right now again? I know [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=369.54s)]
*  We're all terrified until the election happens and we need to be because as you point out [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=373.21999999999997s)]
*  Labor has history of losing. I'm a Democrat. So I get my heart broken a lot here, but the polling [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=377.14s)]
*  You know has you up about 20 points? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=383.3s)]
*  Tell me just before we get into this campaign [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=386.7s)]
*  What happened over the last five years that puts you guys in this position? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=389.38s)]
*  Obviously the Tories, you know lit themselves on fire repeatedly and we'll talk about some of that here [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=394.34s)]
*  But what what is the difference in the Labour Party today and when you told me [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=400.21999999999997s)]
*  That comment about needing to find a leader that can be prime minister on day one [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=405.09999999999997s)]
*  Right after Boris Johnson just kind of wiped you guys out. Keir Starmer is a bright [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=409.7s)]
*  seriously educated [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=415.09999999999997s)]
*  He was a phenomenal lawyer before he came into politics he came into politics relatively late in [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=418.7s)]
*  2015 [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=425.62s)]
*  He definitely crossed that threshold of someone who looks like a prime minister [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=426.78000000000003s)]
*  The big question was actually not whether he looked like a prime minister is whether he could lead the Labour Party and change [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=433.18s)]
*  The Labour Party and of course he came into office dealing with the pandemic [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=439.74s)]
*  First off so he could not even get out of his [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=444.98s)]
*  home [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=448.7s)]
*  for the first stages of [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=450.06s)]
*  His leadership but when he got out of his home he was determined to deal with the problems we had around anti-semitism [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=452.54s)]
*  He was determined to reorientate the party to look at the country and that mean that meant that there were things that the party [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=459.94s)]
*  Wedded to that got thrown out because they weren't priorities for [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=468.94s)]
*  the country [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=473.9s)]
*  He was determined not to fight the sort of [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=476.22s)]
*  You know the the cancel culture stuff the woke stuff and all of that but to stay in the mainstream and in the UK [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=479.24s)]
*  Electrical cycle it's about the economy stupid. It's about public services [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=487.92s)]
*  People schools at the the state of our National Health Service crime on our streets [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=493.56s)]
*  Right in the center ground bold on climate [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=499.96000000000004s)]
*  But the but the biggest thing was just changing the party [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=504.12s)]
*  And convincing the electorate that if you can change the party actually [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=507.68s)]
*  Let's give this guy another opportunity to change the country. So he did that and then he allowed [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=511.88s)]
*  The Conservative Party to self combust [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=518.68s)]
*  And you know some politicians want to always get into the action [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=522.24s)]
*  Sometimes if your opponents are pulling themselves apart sit back and watch [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=525.04s)]
*  That political judgment that's required he showed in huge [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=529.76s)]
*  Quantum so, you know, I I'm just and I have to say let me just tell you I I [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=536.0799999999999s)]
*  Co chaired his campaign to become the leader of the late party [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=542.64s)]
*  You know, he had to be selected there was a contest and I warned him to set himself [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=546.52s)]
*  Look, don't be too ambitious. I said set yourself a 10-year cycle [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=551.8s)]
*  You might just lose the next election and then you can go again [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=555.84s)]
*  He disagreed with me. He said no I can do this in five [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=560.12s)]
*  He proved himself right so if he wins on [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=563.5600000000001s)]
*  July the fourth [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=567.5200000000001s)]
*  He will have a huge opportunity to take his mandate [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=570.5600000000001s)]
*  I think into the country because this will be written up as one of the biggest comeback stories in a natural history [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=575.84s)]
*  So I want to ask you about the the right the Tories because as you've said you [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=582.32s)]
*  You but one of the things that starmer and you and the Labour Party have done is kind of really claimed that [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=587.12s)]
*  Center and part of that's because of the changes you've made to the party [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=591.76s)]
*  Part of that's because you know, Boris Johnson [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=596.24s)]
*  Had to resign and somewhat disgrace [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=599.76s)]
*  Because of you know lying and kovat parties and just general, you know, Boris Johnson vibes [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=603.28s)]
*  Liz trusts almost tanked the Bank of England in a few days [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=610.3199999999999s)]
*  Rishi Sunak. I mean last week we were covering this D-day [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=613.92s)]
*  Fiasco he hasn't really had any vision for the country and so, you know, some of these polls have the [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=616.88s)]
*  Tories only winning as few as like around 100 seats now people need to bear in mind [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=624.0s)]
*  This is in a 650 seat House of Commons [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=628.1600000000001s)]
*  The party that is completely dominated British politics for most of the last, you know, say at least 150 years [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=631.28s)]
*  And the question would ask you though, is it part of what's happening is [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=636.72s)]
*  More than half the people voted for the Tories in the last election are saying [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=640.08s)]
*  More than half the people voted for the Tories in the last election are saying they plan to vote for a different party [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=643.76s)]
*  Some that's going to labor but some that's going to Nigel Farage who's thrown his hat in the ring [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=648.4000000000001s)]
*  And the reform party is just just a few points behind the Tories [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=655.52s)]
*  Now in some of these polls [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=660.08s)]
*  And I just want to ask you how do you see the the British right now on the one hand? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=661.9200000000001s)]
*  It's you know, we're all probably glad to see the Tories facing accountability [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=666.32s)]
*  And frankly in a way that the I mean, this is my words not yours the the american republican party has avoided here [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=670.66s)]
*  But also it's a little concerning to see Nigel Farage getting any support anywhere [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=677.3s)]
*  What do you anticipate in terms of the British right and and how should we across the pond here? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=682.7399999999999s)]
*  Look at whatever traction Nigel Farage is getting is he is he trolling the Tory party? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=688.42s)]
*  Does he have a real chance of kind of taking over the British right? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=692.8199999999999s)]
*  Maybe even using this as a platform to to try to take over some leadership of the Tory party [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=696.1s)]
*  There are a number of things to say [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=700.5s)]
*  on this front [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=703.3000000000001s)]
*  Ben the first thing to say is that we're in a cycle [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=705.54s)]
*  in our [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=711.22s)]
*  politics [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=712.66s)]
*  And this is the same across [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=714.1s)]
*  Western democracies. It's something that we see in the united states and certainly see [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=716.26s)]
*  In the united kingdom and across europe [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=720.98s)]
*  It's important to emphasize which is a cycle that effectively begun [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=723.86s)]
*  in 2008 with the huge banking crisis [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=728.58s)]
*  And your old boss inherited this problem big time. We're still in the same cycle [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=733.14s)]
*  Um, it's an economic cycle in which significant parts [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=738.18s)]
*  of the traditional [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=743.06s)]
*  Sometimes in america, it's called the the the rust belt or the sun belt [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=745.3s)]
*  Um here in the uk it's it's it's it's often parts of the old industrial north our seaside towns [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=750.02s)]
*  significant working families really struggling [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=757.44s)]
*  economically seeing their jobs lost [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=761.2s)]
*  And other things and against that backdrop we have a polarized politics [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=764.34s)]
*  Driven by social media and definitely we've seen in the united kingdom [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=768.82s)]
*  Politics on the extreme left and politics on the extreme right. I don't think that pendulum's changed [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=774.26s)]
*  And if you're in a western democracy [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=780.5799999999999s)]
*  It's still with us and clearly as a progressive. It's something of huge concern coming from the right in our electoral cycle [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=783.22s)]
*  In 2019 there was a huge focus on jeremy corbyn [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=791.22s)]
*  And the left in the british system far less focus on what was happening to the conservative party under [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=795.86s)]
*  Boris johnson. Well, that genie is most definitely out of the bottle and [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=803.06s)]
*  You know what the truth is that populists never deliver not really the rhetoric is there [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=808.74s)]
*  Um, the empathetic tone is there for some of those communities that's attractive but the delivery [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=814.9s)]
*  Oh my god, the delivery is something else and that has come home to roost [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=821.06s)]
*  Whatever I might have said or my views about margaret thatcher. I would simply not have been able to [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=826.42s)]
*  Suggest that she'd achieved nothing [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=832.18s)]
*  In uh years of office she'd achieved a huge amount even though I disagree with it. You might have disagreed with some of it [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=835.06s)]
*  Here we've got a bunch of folk. They've achieved nothing [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=841.86s)]
*  Effectively nothing that they can point to to the electorate apart from these [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=845.68s)]
*  Manufactured rows that they create [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=851.52s)]
*  Around council culture and woke type issues that is significant [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=854.26s)]
*  I think it's also true to say that [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=858.9s)]
*  Even where the conservatives were running on a compassionate conservative agenda [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=862.02s)]
*  Under david cameron and george osborne [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=867.78s)]
*  back in the early noughties [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=871.38s)]
*  They were struggling to get over that threshold to actually form a government. That's why they were in coalition [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=874.3399999999999s)]
*  With the liberal democrats in our system. So I do think that there is a there's a crisis for them on the right [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=880.98s)]
*  The instinct I suspect will be to swing [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=887.6999999999999s)]
*  Towards reform and to nijal farage [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=891.86s)]
*  If they don't win the general election next week, um, generally speaking [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=896.02s)]
*  Politics is fought on the center ground and parties that give up the center ground do not win office. That was [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=903.3s)]
*  our experience back in 2019 and [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=910.98s)]
*  And and just before that and i'm afraid [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=914.5799999999999s)]
*  Well, it's let's see where the conservatives find themselves, but I have to caveat that because we are seeing [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=917.9399999999999s)]
*  a trend in europe [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=925.2199999999999s)]
*  where these parties are [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=927.78s)]
*  Winning, but they tend to win by jettisoning policies that that are that feel too extreme and that's the experience in italy [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=930.3399999999999s)]
*  Um, and actually we're seeing some of that evidence [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=938.9799999999999s)]
*  with le pen [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=942.66s)]
*  In france, so I haven't got a crystal ball [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=944.34s)]
*  But it is extraordinary to be in a situation where nijal farage's reform party [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=948.6600000000001s)]
*  Is outperforming in the polls the traditional conservative party and if parties don't attend [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=954.5s)]
*  To delivery then they can end up extinct is the truth and that was what the labor party was facing. Thank god [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=962.6600000000001s)]
*  um, uh kirstama, um, uh [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=969.3000000000001s)]
*  Particularly gripped this and took us back into a mainstream center direction [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=972.74s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's a good summary in the sense that the tories other than brexit, right? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=978.02s)]
*  They did nothing with this, you know successive mandates other than a lot of austerity that you know [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=982.26s)]
*  hurt a lot of people and then a lot of uh chaos and then a lot of you know, woke cancel culture stuff [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=987.5400000000001s)]
*  But there's a seriousness to it. The the one scandal I wanted to to to tap into today because you know, we can pick [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=994.5s)]
*  From a lot of choices with the tories is this new betting scandal? Um, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1002.1s)]
*  Where for people i've been following this [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1006.74s)]
*  Um, there are reports that several people in rishi sunak circle [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1009.38s)]
*  placed bets on the date of the [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1014.1s)]
*  General election now again for americans the prime minister kind of calls the timing of the election [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1016.34s)]
*  So if you were you know wanted to lay a bet on something and you knew about this you could obviously make some money off this [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1022.26s)]
*  I'm gonna play a clip from sunak responding to this and then I want to just frame it in a question for you [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1028.02s)]
*  But uh, let's hear rishi sunak [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1033.06s)]
*  Uh, who's been having a great couple weeks here between skipping dda and now this [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1035.38s)]
*  Let's hear rishi sunak responding to this betting scandal. I was incredibly angry [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1039.38s)]
*  Incredibly angry when I learned about these allegations in the same anger that many of you will feel and everyone [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1043.8400000000001s)]
*  Watching and it's right that they are investigated thoroughly. These are serious allegations [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1050.9s)]
*  I guess the [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1056.66s)]
*  The the the question I have here is that this can seem like kind of a small thing [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1058.98s)]
*  But actually to me, it's the whole ball game in the sense that [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1064.98s)]
*  Politics is just for sport. It's just for personal gain. It's the same reason that [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1068.5s)]
*  I'm sorry to answer my question here [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1073.22s)]
*  But like boris johnson having parties in number 10 at the same time. He's telling people they can't go out [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1075.22s)]
*  Rishi sunax would rather fly back to london to do an interview than be there with d-day veterans [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1080.4199999999998s)]
*  now he's got people betting on the day of the election and the serious question I want to ask you is [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1085.62s)]
*  It feels like there must be a kind of a crisis of do people trust institutions? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1090.98s)]
*  Do people trust politicians if you are able to win apart from kind of being able to beat these people? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1094.34s)]
*  What can you do to kind of rebuild the sense that actually? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1100.82s)]
*  Government and politics is supposed to work for people [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1104.4199999999998s)]
*  When there's been such kind of disregard for that kind of trust it saddens me to have to say this [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1107.7s)]
*  in a very cynical [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1114.26s)]
*  political environment [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1116.98s)]
*  but in the end if [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1119.22s)]
*  politics isn't about [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1122.24s)]
*  service [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1124.42s)]
*  And public service were finished [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1125.78s)]
*  And democracy is desperately desperately undermined [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1129.46s)]
*  um, of course [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1133.78s)]
*  Politics throws up the occasional scandal the occasional resignation [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1136.26s)]
*  but [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1142.5s)]
*  Let's remember that what this crisis I think that's gripping the conservative party underlines [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1143.78s)]
*  um is the [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1150.8999999999999s)]
*  Terribly low moral standards set by boris johnson and his partying while people died [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1153.2s)]
*  Um, and by the way, the correct behavior was epitomized by the late queen who sat on her own [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1159.94s)]
*  When her husband, um, uh, the duke of edinburgh had passed away boris johnson's [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1166.98s)]
*  Number 10 were partying on that [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1173.06s)]
*  very very day [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1175.78s)]
*  um, and um, it's also [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1178.02s)]
*  evokes [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1181.7s)]

*  And the way in which contracts were given to friends [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1188.2800000000002s)]
*  of ministers [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1193.4s)]
*  in a way that [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1194.92s)]
*  Really attracted very little accountability and very little transparency rishisunat promised integrity [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1196.3600000000001s)]
*  Professionalism and accountability instead when i'm afraid what we got was the incredible weakness [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1203.6200000000001s)]
*  Um, and I think that on the back of d-day as you said [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1209.4s)]
*  Poor judgment, but this venal sense [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1214.0400000000002s)]
*  That actually money is to be made on the date of the election and it indicates a way in which [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1217.72s)]
*  those in representative office have entirely lost touch [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1224.2s)]
*  with the [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1228.3600000000001s)]
*  sanctity of the role that comes with politics [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1229.6200000000001s)]
*  And the degree of integrity that's required when you have the privilege of being in the know about for example [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1233.0s)]
*  When an election day is called now [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1240.76s)]
*  I want to get into issues and most of this will spend on on foreign policy, which has emerged as your portfolio [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1243.16s)]
*  Um, but just one question on you know, you'll be coming in, you know [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1249.0800000000002s)]

*  Um, you know, there's not a lot of revenue coming in brexit's created problems [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1263.0s)]
*  Um, what what is the big program that you guys are campaigning on? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1267.0800000000002s)]
*  Like what is how would you want to be judged for for success in your first year in office? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1270.44s)]
*  What do you have to get done? [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1275.56s)]
*  Um as as your key kind of domestic and economic program and then we'll get into foreign policy. Well, it's growth [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1277.16s)]
*  um [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1283.8s)]
*  The uk is going to struggle unless we get back to growth [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1284.8400000000001s)]
*  Um that takes a reorientation [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1288.44s)]
*  um, and clearly [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1291.72s)]
*  We need economic stability and it's extraordinary to have to say that that's what we need [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1294.6000000000001s)]
*  But after liz truss [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1299.3200000000002s)]
*  um, uh [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1301.3200000000002s)]
*  And to some extent rishi sunak because our economy is still in a terrible place [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1303.0800000000002s)]
*  the highest taxes people have ever faced in 70 years [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1308.68s)]

*  No growth or slow growth. We have to get back to stability and growth [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1313.3200000000002s)]
*  um [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1319.48s)]
*  A bit like you saw with joe biden. Um [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1320.76s)]
*  Uh a reorientation towards facing the climate emergency, uh that race on [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1324.44s)]
*  um the [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1332.68s)]
*  The net zero challenge that we have [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1334.2800000000002s)]
*  uh, it's hugely important to our economy and [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1337.0s)]
*  um [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1341.0s)]
*  That has been center stage of one of our propositions [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1341.8000000000002s)]
*  Uh, we want to be fiscally responsible and sensible. So we have indicated in our manifesto [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1346.1200000000001s)]
*  The areas where we will [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1352.5400000000002s)]
*  Uh raise taxes we're going to change [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1354.7800000000002s)]
*  Uh the situation for what we call people who are non-domiciled [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1357.5800000000002s)]
*  Um in the uk, they're basically internationals [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1361.66s)]
*  Not paying tax. We're going to change that arrangement and use that money particularly in the [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1364.7800000000002s)]
*  In areas of the health service [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1370.94s)]
*  And we're making some changes to the way that our schools that are not not our state public schools [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1373.18s)]
*  But our private schools have have had certain tax breaks in order to raise money for the majority of young people the 94 [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1379.34s)]
*  Of young people in our state education system [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1386.6999999999998s)]
*  These are important changes. We need one of six and a half thousand teachers [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1389.58s)]
*  For example that we're going to get from that small change so [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1393.02s)]
*  Propositions that rebuilds trust in relation to our public services with the nhs huge waiting lists for people [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1396.9199999999998s)]
*  Um, if they need cancer treatment or even if they just want to you know, see primary care [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1403.82s)]
*  Um progress in our schools, but in the end you can only do it if you are fiscally responsible and you get back growth [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1408.7s)]
*  Part of that growth of course is in our relationship with the international community [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1417.74s)]
*  um [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1423.1000000000001s)]
*  and [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1424.14s)]
*  I'm looking forward to being in india [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1425.5s)]
*  Where I hope we will side that trade deal with the indians [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1428.5400000000002s)]
*  Over this next period and they seem very keen to do that. We want to mend fences with our friends in europe [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1433.18s)]
*  You know, we have this bitter divorce [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1439.3400000000001s)]
*  um and led if you like by boris johnson and [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1441.9s)]
*  Liz truss and rishi sunak [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1444.94s)]
*  We're not going back into the european union [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1447.1000000000001s)]
*  But there's going to be a reset on the tone and we're offering the european union a security pact [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1449.74s)]
*  Based on of course defense, but energy climate a whole range of issues that they care about and we want to strike [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1456.22s)]
*  uh [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1464.54s)]
*  Uh a different arrangement to the one that boris johnson struck on the trade arrangement that he set with them [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1465.02s)]
*  So all of that will give us stability and growth. That is how we will be judged in five years time [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1470.7s)]
*  Okay [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1476.7s)]
*  So now I want to go into foreign policy and starting with kind of your general vision and then take take you around the world [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1476.94s)]
*  Of some of the the key hot spots [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1482.78s)]
*  You laid out I think a good summary of your worldview and foreign affairs [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1485.5800000000002s)]
*  Uh a few weeks ago a piece called the case for progressive realism. Um, I like that. That's a good term [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1489.5s)]
*  I I my own piece in foreign affairs the other day was [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1495.3400000000001s)]
*  Very much in line with that. Uh that that that theory of the case [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1498.94s)]
*  You know, we need to be real about the world as it is [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1503.26s)]
*  Um, I I want to just ask you to start [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1506.38s)]
*  Um, what would stay the same in british foreign policy and what would change in british foreign policy, uh broadly speaking under a labor government [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1509.74s)]
*  I know there's some things where you want to signal consistency and then there's some areas where you want to take a different course [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1517.26s)]
*  How how would you sum up? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1523.6599999999999s)]
*  Uh the the the what stays the same and what changes well, there's going to be a reset on europe [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1525.1799999999998s)]
*  There's going to be a reset [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1531.5s)]
*  on climate [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1533.8999999999999s)]
*  for sure [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1535.6599999999999s)]
*  And there's going to be a reset frankly on our relations with the global south [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1537.5s)]
*  Uh, particularly in some of those middle power nations where this business of meeting the world as it is [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1543.8200000000002s)]
*  Not as we would like it to be is very important and not talking down [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1549.98s)]
*  Patronizing and being just downright rude to folk like boris johnson was prepared to be extraordinary. All of that will go [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1556.2s)]
*  Ben [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1563.6599999999999s)]
*  I think your listeners don't underestimate how important those resets i've set are [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1564.6999999999998s)]
*  Are there and then there's got to be a gear shift and the gear shift has got to be on [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1570.54s)]
*  Economic growth and economic diplomacy. I think is hugely important. Hence what i'm indicating [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1575.58s)]
*  With you know [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1582.86s)]
*  india countries in the gulf [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1584.86s)]
*  Uh, potentially the united states and uh, the eu is very very important [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1586.9399999999998s)]
*  Um, uh and [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1592.7s)]
*  Just a different approach particularly on areas [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1594.7800000000002s)]
*  um like climate so [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1598.0600000000002s)]
*  and then [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1601.0200000000002s)]
*  obviously on the security piece [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1602.0600000000002s)]
*  with war in europe and real problems [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1605.1000000000001s)]
*  in the middle east [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1609.3400000000001s)]
*  We have been crystal clear in our support for ukraine and crystal clear in our in our [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1612.0600000000002s)]
*  Our long-standing commitment to a two-state [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1618.0600000000002s)]
*  Solution particularly to a ceasefire [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1621.18s)]
*  um in [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1623.9s)]
*  Gaza and in that crisis and to doing all that we can [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1626.3000000000002s)]
*  to bring peace and stability to the middle east so [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1631.0200000000002s)]
*  That's quite a different template to the one that we've been on [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1635.18s)]
*  In the last few years here in the united kingdom. Yeah, I mean it sounds like uh in watching you [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1638.94s)]
*  Um, and and I guess i'll i'll go to ukraine first here and we'll come back to gaza, of course [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1645.1s)]
*  but on ukraine now, I think you guys have tried to signal, you know, we may be a left to center party, but we [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1650.94s)]
*  We are in you know, there's a kind of british mainstream [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1656.62s)]
*  That is supportive of ukraine that is invested in ukraine [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1660.3s)]
*  um [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1664.06s)]
*  That has generally been more forward-leaning than other european countries and providing certain weapon systems ukraine [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1664.86s)]
*  Um, we're at a place now where if you guys take power the the wars [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1670.54s)]
*  Uh, you know a stalemate if not trending negatively for the ukrainians on the front line [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1675.1799999999998s)]
*  You've had zelensky asking for less restrictions on weapons [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1680.46s)]
*  Uh more systems obviously it was hard to get that [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1683.82s)]
*  package of assistance out of the u.s congress recently [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1687.74s)]
*  um, I do want to note that [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1690.78s)]
*  There while the british mainstream has been supportive of ukraine nijal faraj [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1693.34s)]
*  Who as you said is kind of making a move to be the kind of leader of the right [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1697.42s)]
*  Um has sounded a little bit more like you know the trump, uh wing of the republican party on ukraine recently [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1701.82s)]
*  I just want to play a clip about uh that faraj recently talking about uh ukraine with the bbc [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1707.9s)]
*  When vladimir putin sent his troops across the border in 22 [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1714.1399999999999s)]
*  You blamed the west not him. You said i'll just read it to you and then you can react [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1718.86s)]
*  That on a tweet it was a consequence of eu [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1723.58s)]
*  And nato expansion is that a judgment in the standby right? I'll tell you what you don't know [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1727.74s)]
*  I stood up in the european parliament in 2014 and I said and I quote [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1732.6999999999998s)]
*  There will be a war in ukraine [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1737.6599999999999s)]
*  Why did I say that it was obvious to me that the ever eastward expansion of nato and the european union [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1741.26s)]
*  Was giving this man a reason [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1748.2199999999998s)]
*  To his russian people to say they're coming for us again and to go to war but you were echoing him [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1751.42s)]
*  I was sorry you were echoing him. That's what putin says. No, no, no, no, sorry [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1756.78s)]
*  I've been saying this actually since actually since the 1990s ever since ever since so it's he [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1761.58s)]
*  Hang on a second. We provoke this war [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1768.46s)]
*  It's you know, of course, it's his fault. He's used what we've provoked the invasion. Yes [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1771.3400000000001s)]
*  And very interestingly once again 10 years ago when I predicted this by the way [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1775.98s)]
*  I'm the only person in british politics that predicted what would happen. I don't agree with nijal faraj at all [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1779.8200000000002s)]
*  but we we we can't dismiss entirely a populist view that is gaining traction right in europe and the us [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1785.42s)]
*  and [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1791.5800000000002s)]
*  As there's fatigue with cost of living issues [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1792.7800000000002s)]
*  My question here is if you guys come into power [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1796.38s)]
*  One how do you deal with the politics of ukraine so that in europe in the us in the uk? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1799.18s)]
*  We're able to sustain what could be, you know, pretty costly support going forward [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1805.58s)]
*  And then what is your message to the ukrainians? How do you what is a labor government saying? [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1810.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean you saw zelensky in normandy. I imagine you had the chance to [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1814.78s)]
*  To talk to him and kirste farmer did what what's your message to the ukrainians about what a labor government will do on ukraine? [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1819.8999999999999s)]
*  Well, let me just start with that faraj statement, which I think is just utterly utterly appalling and [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1825.26s)]
*  You know, there's this horrible thing that we see historically [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1833.9s)]
*  where characters like faraj [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1837.98s)]
*  Have a some sort of relationship with [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1841.9s)]
*  authoritarianism [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1846.04s)]
*  And the brutality that sits behind that [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1847.74s)]
*  this kind of horrendous big man politics [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1851.26s)]
*  Where he seems more comfortable being a defender and speaking for the kremlin than he does for his own people [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1854.7s)]
*  and [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1862.3s)]
*  For me, the compass is really simple and all of the evidence is the british people are in a similar place [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1863.34s)]
*  Right of freedom [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1870.22s)]
*  And the freedom we enjoy [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1871.74s)]
*  Ben you and I to have this conversation and the majority of listeners [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1873.9s)]
*  Uh, either that's something worth fighting for or we're happy to allow [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1879.18s)]
*  uh putin [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1883.9s)]
*  um the kind of new fascism that he's displaying and [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1885.42s)]
*  I I just think I think it's just horrendous when you think of the thousands of lives that have been lost in ukraine since [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1889.74s)]
*  2014 because for them this story begun in 2014 to sort of concede that ground and say somehow it was provoked by us [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1897.0s)]
*  You know in the end when I go to ukraine and i've now been many many times before this crisis what I see [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1904.4599999999998s)]
*  Is a group of people [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1911.6599999999999s)]
*  Who want their own autonomy in those that that freedom and I think it is entirely wrong to live in a world [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1913.5s)]
*  Where we allow big powers to start redrawing the map for their small neighbors [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1920.54s)]
*  Um, so that degree of self-determination that I think is just vital in any democracy. I think we've got to stand for [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1926.46s)]
*  um [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1932.78s)]
*  And look we've now got uh, you know ukraine who the funds are coming through [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1934.06s)]
*  Um, it has been tough over the last little while [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1940.46s)]
*  But I think it could improve considerably [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1945.1s)]
*  Over the next few months particularly with the air defenses that the ukrainians are asking for [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1947.74s)]
*  If we come out of this [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1954.54s)]
*  election [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1956.22s)]
*  Over the line. I will attend nato with kirstama [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1957.4199999999998s)]
*  uh, and our defense lead [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1961.34s)]
*  In dc [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1965.1799999999998s)]
*  And the unity that we need [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1966.62s)]
*  Coming out of that is going to be hugely hugely [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1969.4199999999998s)]
*  important [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1973.1s)]
*  It's been really important for us here in the uk labor party [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1974.3s)]
*  Not to play politics with this serious issue not to be partisan with this serious issue [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1978.2199999999998s)]
*  And I you know every time i've been in dc and i've been in dc with you ben [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1983.8999999999999s)]
*  I've wanted to deliver that message to democrats and republicans alike. I don't say this is easy [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1987.6599999999999s)]
*  But I say what is the choice? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1992.9399999999998s)]
*  And where will this end if we give up on ukraine, where will this end where we remember the story? [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=1994.94s)]
*  the horrific story of the 1930s [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2003.18s)]
*  In europe and what happens when you concede? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2007.02s)]
*  to [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2010.38s)]
*  um [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2011.26s)]
*  authoritarianisms [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2012.28s)]
*  authoritarianism so the truth is [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2013.66s)]
*  the combined [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2016.7s)]
*  Um nato nato by the way, which is a labor party inheritance [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2019.26s)]
*  It's the work of clematne and naibevin that gave us nato if we combine I think we can [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2023.98s)]
*  Demonstrate to putin that we are there for the long haul and is that [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2030.92s)]
*  That will bring him to the table and you know part of what you need to do is is kind of fortify ukraine [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2036.78s)]
*  for negotiation and for long-term success [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2041.66s)]
*  there, you know [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2044.8600000000001s)]
*  We all know their preferred option would be to join nato, right? Um, when you go to that nato summit [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2046.46s)]
*  When you look at the range of options of things that can reassure the ukrainians, you know [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2053.26s)]
*  additional weapon systems long-term support [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2058.14s)]
*  The nature of their relationship with nato and security guarantees. They obviously want to be a member of the eu [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2061.5s)]
*  That's on the table too [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2069.34s)]
*  Where do you guys come down on things like nato? [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2071.42s)]
*  Their relationship with nato or what can be done to provide that signal of long-term support beyond just kind of churning out [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2074.06s)]
*  You know frontline military systems. Look, I understand the desire of [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2081.42s)]
*  ukraine, um, I think that we can reach [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2086.6s)]
*  A language and a communicate coming out of nato that we can all agree upon [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2091.1s)]
*  um [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2095.98s)]
*  Uh, they will need guarantees [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2097.1s)]
*  But we have to be serious also [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2099.82s)]
*  About article five and what that means [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2102.38s)]
*  um, uh [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2105.5800000000004s)]
*  For all partners and most definitely the united states [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2107.42s)]
*  um, uh, and we have to be ready for that so i'm confident that we can reach a language [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2111.42s)]
*  We here in the uk [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2117.42s)]
*  Have been you know out in front frankly in support of ukraine [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2120.38s)]
*  Um, and we will continue to be that if there is to be a change of government [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2126.16s)]
*  But I think the most important thing is to remain a united posture after a period where there have been differences [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2131.2s)]
*  And we've got to be careful not to allow [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2138.72s)]
*  um [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2141.8399999999997s)]
*  Putin particularly to capitalize on that and you know, we haven't spoken [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2143.44s)]
*  About his trip [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2148.3999999999996s)]
*  in the last few days [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2150.08s)]
*  To north korea, it's really interesting the south koreans were providing more shells [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2152.56s)]
*  to ukraine than the whole of europe combined [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2160.16s)]
*  When I was recently looking at the figures and there is putting [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2163.92s)]
*  in an alliance [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2168.24s)]
*  That is deeply deeply worrying and so [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2169.7599999999998s)]
*  My bottom line is that we come out of nato in a unified position that is sustained [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2173.04s)]
*  Uh through the election cycle, particularly that we're going to see in the united states [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2178.96s)]
*  Well, yeah, i'm moving to uh to gaza here because I want to make sure we have time for this [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2182.56s)]
*  You know, this is you know continues to uh grind on [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2188.0800000000004s)]
*  There there continues to be this kind of mixed messaging [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2193.6000000000004s)]
*  Out of the netanyahu government which is dealing with a variety of challenges including a supreme court ruling the other day [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2197.6800000000003s)]
*  um [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2203.92s)]
*  Mandating an end to the exemption for alter orthodox serving the israeli military a very volatile issue that you know [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2204.94s)]
*  Could bring down the netanyahu coalition [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2211.7400000000002s)]
*  But then I think you know fundamentally for for you as you're looking at this [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2214.06s)]
*  um netanyahu recently [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2217.82s)]

*  of hamas [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2335.1s)]
*  Uh and sinwale particularly and it is in the hands of the israeli government [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2336.8599999999997s)]

*  For hamas to comply [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2348.54s)]
*  Uh, it would be a very negative step [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2350.3s)]
*  Uh, if netanyahu now backtracked [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2352.7000000000003s)]
*  on that proposal, but we're now in a very [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2355.6600000000003s)]
*  Difficult place. It's my hope and as we head into july, I think there are sort of some signposts here [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2359.34s)]
*  first, of course is [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2366.46s)]
*  I know that netanyahu is scheduled to [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2368.6200000000003s)]
*  Come to dc [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2372.94s)]
*  Uh to to address I think both houses. I think that's going to be very important [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2374.46s)]
*  Uh, the kinesic will wrap up [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2379.9s)]
*  um, um, uh [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2382.3s)]
*  the [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2384.46s)]
*  Washington will go into recess. Can we get that ceasefire before that point? [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2385.5s)]
*  Uh, I saw that hamas have come forward [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2390.46s)]
*  Uh with some further asks [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2393.1800000000003s)]
*  Um, can we can can those be met? [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2395.5s)]
*  The time is now it seems to me and I worry hugely about the prospects of escalation [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2398.86s)]
*  um, uh in lebanon particularly as we head to september and as we head particularly to the [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2405.58s)]
*  inability of the many people who have left, um northern israel, um, um, uh, southern lebanon [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2412.76s)]
*  Able to return to their homes. So I think this is a [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2421.26s)]
*  Difficult and challenging period [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2425.42s)]
*  Um, I really you know, we have to ensure that [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2429.42s)]
*  There's no backtracking on this proposal for peace [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2433.26s)]
*  But equally in the end [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2437.5s)]
*  Hamas and their positioning is going to be very important as we use all diplomatic levers [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2439.34s)]
*  To bring this about now [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2445.02s)]
*  I will aim to be as supportive as I can be to the important international actors here of which clearly [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2446.54s)]
*  Uh in the in the middle east qatar [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2454.2200000000003s)]
*  Uh egypt applying an important role, uh, but also here the united states. I got just two more questions, uh, one [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2457.7599999999998s)]
*  One about kind of politics that interacts with the hamas and I just want to end on a personal question [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2465.92s)]
*  so [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2471.52s)]
*  I do want to ask you from the left a question from the left david [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2472.72s)]
*  You you make a very persuasive case that I very much agree with about [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2477.92s)]
*  What labor has done to be able to put itself in a position to win hopefully like a very decisive majority [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2483.6s)]
*  Um at the same time [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2490.08s)]
*  You know, there's been kind of a pretty ruthless [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2491.92s)]
*  Uh effort to make sure that nothing interferes with that and i'm speaking particularly about [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2495.6s)]
*  You know, there have been a couple of candidates. Um, you know who? [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2501.7599999999998s)]
*  Who lost labor party support for statements they made often in conjunction with gaza, right? [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2505.7599999999998s)]
*  So people who said things that um were seen as kind of straying too far [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2511.04s)]
*  Out of the mainstream [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2515.44s)]
*  And you know, you know, you and I have hung out in london. You know the kind of people i'm friends with [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2517.04s)]
*  They I think some of those people would say well, wait a second [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2521.2799999999997s)]
*  What happened to you know, david limey's progressive guy labor has to stand for certain things we get you make certain adjustments, but [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2524.88s)]
*  How do you guard against? [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2532.56s)]
*  You know [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2535.36s)]
*  As you are trying to thread that needle right between being a principal progressive as i've always known you to be [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2536.32s)]
*  And and and being successful politically [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2543.04s)]
*  I mean this issue is obviously the most complicated one to do that on [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2546.4s)]
*  But kind of what would you say to people who say you know what I want labor to win? [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2549.52s)]
*  I've you know, but i'm a little uncomfortable with with the fact that a couple of these candidates are more to the left [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2552.96s)]
*  Kind of got tossed overboard [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2558.4s)]
*  Particularly on on the on the on the israel palestine issue progressive realism [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2560.24s)]
*  Read my article in foreign affairs power is important [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2566.0s)]
*  My political party has been out of power for most of my 52 years [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2571.6s)]
*  On the planet, um and for most of the history of the 20th century and the 21st [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2578.72s)]
*  um [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2584.3999999999996s)]
*  and so in that um [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2585.9199999999996s)]
*  124 years [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2587.98s)]
*  um if you're happy with uh [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2590.8s)]
*  a philosophical purest place [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2593.6s)]
*  In which progressives here in the united kingdom are in power for less than a third of that time [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2596.32s)]
*  In fact, it might even be less than it's less than that. It's less. It's certainly less than a third [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2603.2000000000003s)]
*  It might be just about a quarter of that time then fine. Let's be purist [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2606.48s)]
*  Um about this but i'm afraid [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2610.8s)]
*  We have to be orientated towards the country [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2613.36s)]
*  Um, we have to be be capable of pragmatism [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2616.2400000000002s)]
*  Um, we have to win friends and votes beyond just our tradition and here in the uk [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2620.4s)]
*  We have to persuade if we're to form a government always when we form a government we have to persuade [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2628.0s)]
*  um, um a large chunk of conservatists to lend us their vote, um, uh in any election cycle [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2632.8s)]
*  And in those circumstances over correction, you know [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2639.92s)]

*  Um, if it's progressive in order to help progress the sort of progress that brings me here [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2670.16s)]
*  as the potential first foreign secretary of someone of [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2676.72s)]

*  um, you can't get there if you're just wedded to [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2688.64s)]
*  um theory [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2692.3199999999997s)]
*  And if you're just wedded to a politics that never changes his mind [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2694.3199999999997s)]
*  Uh, if you want a politics that never changes his mind, then i'm sure ben [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2697.92s)]
*  Uh, you can get jeremy corbyn to come on and you know, and and he doesn't change his mind [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2702.96s)]
*  uh, but uh, and he's pretty uncompromising [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2708.32s)]
*  But the truth is we tried that more times than not and it's failed. Yeah, it's it's not diligent [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2712.1600000000003s)]
*  And you know, let me just tell you this I grew up poor [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2718.8s)]
*  in [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2722.96s)]
*  Tottenham working class and I remember loads of wonderful socialist friends, you know vote for us. We'll get there [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2724.08s)]
*  Then they would we call them champagne socialists [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2731.2s)]
*  They would then get to the election lose and who struggled me? [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2735.04s)]
*  And my brethren felt like me they were fine [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2739.68s)]
*  So i'm really clear on where we have to be [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2742.72s)]
*  orientated to win an election cycle and you know, and and I and I I [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2746.2999999999997s)]

*  There are sister party many democrat friends and republicans and what I noticed in the [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2760.88s)]
*  Trump opposition when I spoke to campaign folk, they were really organized. They were on the data [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2766.7200000000003s)]
*  They were they they could show me the stats on african americans coming over them hispanics coming over them that the messaging was clear [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2772.88s)]

*  I say to democrat friends. It's not for me to judge [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2787.92s)]
*  But what i'm saying is we have to be in the mainstream with a forward proposition [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2790.0800000000004s)]
*  For most of the country it's the food on the table. We have to explain things clearly and sometimes yes [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2795.36s)]
*  Sometimes we have to put the ideological stuff [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2801.04s)]
*  Not to one side [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2804.7200000000003s)]
*  But we have to remember that we have to win office first if we're to deliver well look that's that's a powerful answer [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2806.3199999999997s)]

*  To ask the kind of question that that might make my eyes well up and you so i'm [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2863.68s)]
*  Um, you know it it it of course, it's it it's a huge [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2870.0s)]
*  Huge moment. It would be a huge moment. Um [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2875.68s)]
*  I'm thinking of my parents. I we call them the windrush generation the people that came [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2879.7599999999998s)]
*  To this country to help rebuild it after the second world war and they came from the west indies in the caribbean [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2885.52s)]
*  They would never have dreamed [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2890.96s)]
*  That a moment like this might be upon us [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2893.52s)]
*  I'm thinking of the journey of my party [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2896.56s)]
*  You know being in the wilderness and having no power is not fun 14 years is a long long time [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2899.2799999999997s)]
*  um [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2905.9199999999996s)]
*  I'm thinking of the remarkable turnaround after after five years [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2907.04s)]
*  um, and what kir starmer has done and i've been at his [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2911.3599999999997s)]
*  um, you know [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2915.2s)]
*  Right behind him supporting him all the way and it has not been easy. It really has not been easy [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2916.72s)]
*  Um, and i'm also thinking of this tough geopolitical moment where of course there is [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2922.7999999999997s)]
*  Huge rancor on social media huge bitterness in places and there have been of course [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2927.92s)]
*  Tremendous pressures because of this war in israel gaza [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2933.98s)]
*  Particularly, so it will be a tremendous moment. Um, if it comes about it would be an emotional moment [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2938.3799999999997s)]
*  but more than anything else the joy [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2944.48s)]
*  of seeing progressive politicians [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2948.56s)]
*  Walking up that street into number 10 [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2951.94s)]
*  Uh called in by kir starmer [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2955.2200000000003s)]
*  Turning a page on the ranker division and the hopelessness of these last few years with which so little has been achieved [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2958.1800000000003s)]
*  By the british conservative party. Oh my god [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2967.3s)]
*  What a moment and guess what? [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2971.0600000000004s)]
*  Um, it's potentially a progressive moment. We get to work [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2973.38s)]
*  Um together, let's see what happens in the united states, uh, but with schultz with albanese [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2978.1s)]
*  um, uh with trudeau [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2985.3s)]
*  There's a real opportunity particularly on issues like [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2988.1s)]
*  The climate emergency to make a difference. Well, look we we can't wait till july 4th [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2992.02s)]
*  Uh, you know, it's always a fun day here in the u.s [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2996.66s)]
*  But hopefully it'll be a holiday in the uk in the best of sense [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=2999.06s)]
*  Uh, so best of luck in the home stretch david and uh look forward to talking to you on the other end after a good result [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3002.9s)]
*  Ben, thank you so much [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3008.42s)]
*  Okay. So before we get to our interview, uh, I want to go through a couple stories [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3009.94s)]
*  That we want to make sure to check in on because we've covered them before in this podcast [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3015.7000000000003s)]
*  The first is julian assange [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3019.86s)]
*  Uh, the wiki leaks founder his legal saga is finally coming to an end after spending five years in prison in the uk [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3022.34s)]
*  And years before that in kind of de facto [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3028.9s)]
*  Uh house arrest of sorts couldn't leave the ecuadorian embassy in london [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3031.7799999999997s)]
*  Assange left england on monday to fly to the northern mariana islands. That's a u.s territory [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3036.2599999999998s)]
*  Assange did not want to come to the continental united states to face extradition there [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3041.62s)]
*  But he'll be going to this u.s territory where he's agreed to plead guilty to a single felony count of illegally obtaining and disclosing national security [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3045.54s)]
*  material as part of a plea deal with the united states [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3052.24s)]
*  Uh mbc reviewed documents that were filed by the justice department and reports [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3055.7799999999997s)]
*  He's expected to be sentenced to 62 months with credit for time served [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3059.94s)]
*  Which means that once he returns to australia julian assange will be a free man [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3064.3399999999997s)]
*  The national security council spokesperson adrian watson said quote [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3069.7s)]
*  This was an independent decision made by the department of justice and there was no white house involvement in the plea deal decision [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3073.14s)]
*  Uh now the one thing I just say about this is look. I think this is the right [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3080.18s)]
*  Decision, uh, whoever made it. Um [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3085.14s)]
*  Because I think assange this has run its course. He's definitely paid a price for what he's done [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3088.02s)]
*  Um, there were difficult precedents in play. I'm not a fan necessarily of all the things assange did [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3094.58s)]
*  But I do think that prosecuting him under the espionage act in the united states [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3102.1s)]
*  Would have sent a bad precedent for potential future prosecution of journalists [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3106.9s)]
*  Um engaged in more normal journalistic activity [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3111.3s)]
*  I think assange has clearly paid a price [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3114.98s)]
*  And so and I also frankly think that this was a huge issue in australia where there was concern about assange's health [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3117.62s)]
*  His mental health his physical health. Um, this is a key ally of the united states [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3124.34s)]
*  And so this just feels like the right thing [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3128.9s)]
*  To kind of wind this down and wrap it up all in all as good an end to a very complicated and long and winding story [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3130.9s)]
*  Um as there could be I also want to just check in on haiti [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3136.7400000000002s)]
*  The long anticipated canyon police force to help stabilize [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3141.46s)]
*  Haiti began to arrive this week part of a multinational security support mission that's meant to aid the country which has been ravaged by gang violence [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3144.98s)]
*  This initial force is 400 officers with 600 more to be deployed later [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3153.06s)]
*  Other countries have pledged personnel as well that includes the bahamas bangladesh barbedos bali's banin chad jamaica and serna [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3156.98s)]
*  A lot of a lot of b countries in there [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3164.66s)]
*  The us state department has committed 300 million dollars to support the mission last week [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3167.06s)]
*  Tony blinken overrode republican opposition to release over 100 million dollars in funding [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3171.94s)]
*  This comes a couple of weeks after haiti's transitional council appointed a new cabinet in a month after the appointment of a new interim prime minister [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3176.74s)]
*  We were able to catch up with port-au-prince based journalist widlora murrencourt [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3183.86s)]
*  The editor-in-chief of a yibo post and contributor to the washington post to hear about how people are feeling on the ground in haiti right now [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3187.64s)]
*  Let's uh listen to that clip the gangs are still influential of port-au-prince [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3194.2000000000003s)]
*  They kidnapped people [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3199.88s)]
*  They make it extremely difficult for all sorts of institutions including state institutions [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3202.44s)]
*  And hospitals and schools, uh hundreds of schools are today closed in port-au-prince and you have [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3208.52s)]
*  Um [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3215.4s)]
*  about half a million [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3216.6000000000004s)]
*  People left the capital and tens of thousands of them [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3219.0800000000004s)]
*  Since you know february [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3223.8s)]
*  um [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3226.44s)]
*  This is the situation that the haitian people are in right now and we also have [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3227.5600000000004s)]
*  still [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3232.92s)]
*  The food insecurity that haitians people are struggling with you have half of the country now [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3234.36s)]
*  You know food insecure [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3240.84s)]
*  Um and and hundreds of thousands of people, you know waiting for some sort of humanitarian assistance [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3243.32s)]
*  So look, I mean the the situation is quite dire as we've talked about as you just heard [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3250.2000000000003s)]
*  um [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3255.6400000000003s)]
*  And the reality is uh, this offers some hope with this new multinational force beginning to arrive [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3256.84s)]
*  But this can't be the end. It has to be the beginning in my judgment in the past sometimes [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3262.92s)]
*  You know some something happens [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3268.04s)]
*  There's a force deployed to haiti or some aids provided to haiti and people kind of move on [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3269.56s)]
*  I think the key here is going to be sustained attention [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3273.4s)]
*  And this should probably be the beginning of the resources going to haiti not at all the end [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3276.92s)]
*  And so we'll stay on top of this story on the podcast [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3281.2400000000002s)]
*  We hope that the u.s and other governments stay on top of it as well [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3284.12s)]
*  Because the people of haiti have definitely suffered far too much [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3288.36s)]
*  I'm very pleased to be joined by edward wong the diplomatic [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3291.16s)]

*  And then every now and then you get a book that kind of really takes us into [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3317.96s)]
*  The personal story that informs the world view that [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3321.88s)]
*  Made you as a journalist and and I think one of the reasons why this book is so extraordinary and I definitely recommend it [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3326.2s)]
*  To all of our audiences [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3332.6s)]
*  It's a remarkable blend of both memoir [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3334.6s)]
*  And reporting you look into your father's life in communist china [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3337.56s)]
*  His military service which took him all over the country [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3342.04s)]
*  um [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3344.92s)]
*  Experience in the the pla [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3346.28s)]
*  Um, and then you also bring in your own [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3348.36s)]
*  Uh time as a diplomatic correspondent at a hugely consequential moment in china's history [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3352.28s)]
*  between 2008 and in 2016 as china was really beginning to assert itself on the world stage and kind of [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3357.88s)]
*  you know the [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3364.44s)]
*  the realization in some ways of [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3365.5600000000004s)]
*  Parts of what mao was trying to do but also very different probably than mao thought it would go [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3367.96s)]
*  I just wanted to ask to start [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3373.32s)]
*  How did you decide to kind of write this hybrid book, uh that blended together [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3375.7200000000003s)]
*  Your father's story your family story and and your reporting was this something that had been kind of brewing inside you for a long time [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3380.2000000000003s)]
*  um [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3387.88s)]
*  Or is it an idea that kind of came to you recently like what what led you to this approach? [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3388.92s)]
*  Uh, that's a great question ben. It had been percolating for a while. Um, [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3393.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean as I say in the book [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3398.04s)]
*  I didn't know much about my parents histories [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3399.56s)]
*  When I was growing up in a suburb of dc and my father worked very long hours in a chinese restaurant in [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3401.96s)]
*  Virginia and I rarely saw him and it was when I was in grad school studying the history of china and chinese politics that I [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3408.34s)]
*  Decided to probe more into their lives [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3416.2799999999997s)]
*  Uh, and then I learned at that point that he had been a member of the pla which was of course intriguing and [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3418.68s)]
*  Um, but that really got put on steroids when I went to china for the new york times in 2008 at that point [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3424.7599999999998s)]
*  I started traveling to all these parts of the country that I had never seen before including [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3430.7599999999998s)]
*  The county in guandong province next to hong kong where my parents had grown up and I saw [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3435.88s)]
*  You know what the environment the upbringing was like and what the chinese civil war and the japanese occupation must have done [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3441.48s)]
*  to that area I also went out to the far west and far northwest to [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3446.7599999999998s)]
*  Xinjiang which um, as we know is home to uiger and kazakh muslims and I saw the [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3452.04s)]
*  Uh this vast land where my father served as a soldier and essentially been part of the initial military occupation [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3458.76s)]
*  of sinjiang [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3465.56s)]
*  Uh when mao first sent troops out there and as you know that military occupation then evolved to other forms of control [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3466.84s)]
*  and into [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3474.04s)]
*  Uh what we hear today now about the internment camps and other such measures [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3475.4s)]
*  I mean just starting with your your father's story. I mean [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3480.4399999999996s)]
*  how [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3483.72s)]
*  How did you what did you come to learn about his motivation? [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3485.24s)]
*  For being uh in the the pla [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3490.12s)]
*  What was you know a mixture of pride and disillusionment? Uh kind of comes across [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3494.12s)]
*  um [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3499.08s)]
*  But but but how did you kind of piece that story together and trying to put yourself in the shoes of your father as a young man [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3499.96s)]
*  At such a revolutionary period in china's history. Yeah, my father, um grew up in [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3507.16s)]
*  Uh under the rule of the nationalists, um, the nationalists governor over the guangming dog as we know them by and [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3513.16s)]
*  They were trying to control china at the time when there were warlords and when the japanese army was invading china [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3519.8s)]
*  And at the same time they were fighting off this communist insurgency [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3526.12s)]
*  the nationalists had [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3529.7200000000003s)]
*  Policies that led to mass disillusionment among chinese including my father there was huge inflation [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3531.46s)]
*  Um lots of poverty my father saw homeless people in the streets in guizhou [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3537.62s)]
*  And so he really seized on this idea that Mao was pushing that the communists once they took over china would rejuvenate china [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3541.78s)]
*  Would make it a powerful nation once again [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3548.66s)]
*  It would bring it out of the feudal era and into a much more modern and much more industrialized era so that could compete [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3550.42s)]
*  with other superpowers [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3556.9s)]
*  I think partly what I wanted to show readers in that element of the story was that um [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3558.66s)]
*  That there has been mass support for the party [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3564.42s)]
*  Uh from its very early days and that the sense of patriotism or nationalism [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3567.7799999999997s)]
*  In many chinese, um, it can be very strong and it is still very strong today even if some people [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3573.38s)]
*  Question some of the decisions made by leaders or by local officials the sense of patriotism around china around the motherland [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3580.16s)]
*  Is strong and can be really galvanized by leaders such as Mao or such as Xi Jinping today [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3587.6200000000003s)]
*  Well, yeah, I want to get into Xi Jinping because you have a really interesting chapter about [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3592.82s)]
*  Xi Jinping's life [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3598.1800000000003s)]
*  and you you visit [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3600.1800000000003s)]
*  Some of the the touchstones, uh in Xi Jinping's journey [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3603.38s)]
*  obviously this is [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3608.02s)]
*  not an direct analogy right in the sense that [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3610.1000000000004s)]
*  Uh Xi Jinping's father was a you know, relatively important figure in [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3613.54s)]
*  uh the early communist party and he's now the [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3618.2599999999998s)]
*  uh, really the one man rule probably the strongest leader that china's had since deng Xiaoping if not if not now himself [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3621.8599999999997s)]
*  but what I was wondering is that [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3629.14s)]
*  you know [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3631.22s)]
*  You know Xi Jinping had his father and then Xi Jinping, you know, uh had to deal with the fact that [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3632.66s)]
*  You know his father was kind of on the outs and you know got sent to for reeducation [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3638.66s)]
*  um, and he emerges on the other end kind of more devoted to the party, um, [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3643.46s)]
*  and to uh to to Mao and what and it kind of the chinese communist party's version of chinese nationalism [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3649.46s)]
*  Did you at all think about you know, how do these two families the the wang family and Xi Jinping, you know [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3657.86s)]
*  the different journeys [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3664.1s)]
*  Uh that that the two families have undertaken in the sense that um [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3665.54s)]
*  To me, it's kind of interesting, you know, you everybody's transformed by this massive event the chinese revolution [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3671.14s)]
*  And here what is the journey that led Xi Jinping where he landed versus the journey that led? [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3676.82s)]
*  You know ed wong to be the diplomatic correspondent for the new york times [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3682.5s)]
*  Yeah, I mean partly the book talks about I mean the theme of the book is contingencies in history and how [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3685.7s)]
*  uh these huge [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3691.06s)]
*  Um tides in history push us in different directions, but we all end up intersecting again [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3692.34s)]
*  Uh generations later and so my father interestingly was when he was posted out to [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3697.1400000000003s)]
*  Xinjiang that region he was working under [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3702.88s)]
*  Xi's father Xi Zhongxun ultimately like he was part of the military occupation and Xi Zhongxun was the party [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3706.5s)]
*  Official who was governing the entire northwest region of china this vast area and [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3713.04s)]
*  Xi's father Xi Zhongxun would then have debates with Mao and other leaders about whether to go hard or whether to [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3718.7400000000002s)]
*  Loosen up a bit on the policies that they were using to control the muslims and other ethnic groups out there [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3725.94s)]
*  So my father was out there enacting the policies that Xi's father was putting into place [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3731.38s)]
*  um, then [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3736.5s)]
*  A generation later i'm in china reporting on the younger Xi as he starts to impose his forms of control [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3737.78s)]
*  and to shape [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3745.7000000000003s)]
*  His vision of authoritarian rule over china at a time when he thinks china has loosened up too much that [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3747.06s)]
*  the party has become too [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3754.66s)]
*  corrupt in certain ways that [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3756.9s)]
*  economic liberalization [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3759.2999999999997s)]
*  Um is moving vast parts of china's society out of the sphere of party control and he wants to tighten [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3761.14s)]
*  Up on all that which is leading to the policies you're seeing today [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3767.62s)]
*  and [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3772.42s)]
*  Uh, like his elders [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3773.38s)]
*  He also feels [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3775.38s)]
*  A huge devotion to the party and to the idea that the party can lead the country [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3777.86s)]
*  Into an area where it can rival the greatest superpower in the world, which is of course america [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3784.9s)]
*  And so we see that [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3790.1800000000003s)]
*  type of strong nationalistic attitude really taking root [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3792.34s)]
*  with the younger Xi I think that [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3795.86s)]
*  one of the other things that [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3798.26s)]
*  That we see big echoes of for example that I felt in my time in china under seeing that my father felt is this idea of [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3800.5800000000004s)]
*  state security or the national security state [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3808.42s)]
*  This is something that Xi Jinping has been a big push on recently [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3811.5400000000004s)]
*  Um there he's put pushing out propaganda rhetoric [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3815.78s)]
*  Into china saying we need to root out spies. We need to root out foreign agents [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3819.7000000000003s)]
*  We need to look at what influences from the outsider entering china undermining it [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3824.26s)]
*  Um undermining the party ultimately and in my father's time that was a huge element starting [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3829.62s)]
*  From the time Mao took over when there were these campaigns against so-called counter-revolutionaries [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3835.3799999999997s)]
*  And ultimately this is what led [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3840.1s)]
*  my father [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3842.3399999999997s)]
*  On his path to disillusionment because he realized that the party harbored suspicions [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3843.62s)]
*  About him and his family his brother was studying in america and eventually ended up working as an engineer for the u.s military [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3849.06s)]
*  His parents were business people at hong kong and so the party had a file on him and even though my father [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3856.42s)]
*  Went to the farthest reaches of china and served in the hardest positions [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3862.42s)]
*  For the benefit of the party [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3868.02s)]
*  Um, they the party in its fears and in its anxiety and in its suspicions of foreign influence [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3869.86s)]
*  always [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3876.58s)]
*  Had these strong thoughts about my father and the potential threat they saw from people like my father and he was emblematic [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3877.78s)]
*  Of many other chinese that fell under suspicion in those years [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3885.24s)]
*  Well, yeah, I want to ask you about two places that I think you come across very powerfully in your book [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3888.68s)]
*  That also had a big impression on me. That's xinjiang province, uh in hong kong [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3894.68s)]
*  Where you did a lot of reporting and where obviously your family's history, uh was was present [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3901.08s)]
*  um, and I'd say important to me because in a sense it kind of forced me to reckon with [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3906.44s)]
*  um [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3911.64s)]
*  You know the the the communist party not evolving in the direction that you know [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3913.16s)]
*  People like me and the u.s government were hoping that there'd be this kind of incremental liberalization [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3917.48s)]
*  I think even at the beginning of obama years, you know, hu jintao was no liberal at all [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3923.0s)]
*  But it was kind of a consensus based system and it was a little less, you know [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3927.3999999999996s)]
*  Brute force in terms of dealing with internal dissent [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3930.8399999999997s)]
*  But to take them one at a time and you you describe your own reporting in xinjiang province, which is quite extraordinary [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3933.64s)]
*  You got to see things that very few americans [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3940.2799999999997s)]
*  Have ever seen in terms of the nature of the repression there the nature of life there [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3942.92s)]
*  Uh knowing that your father, you know had this history there as well [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3947.5600000000004s)]
*  And and I guess the way i'd frame the question at is that I you know, I think if you talk to some chinese officials [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3951.1600000000003s)]
*  Who might even acknowledge that what they're doing there is pretty pretty brutal [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3956.76s)]
*  They kind of say well, it's inevitable. You know you americans did the same thing, you know [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3961.7200000000003s)]
*  We ultimately just have to [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3966.6800000000003s)]
*  china's, you know suffered from [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3968.92s)]
*  Division and instability and if we don't crack down, you know that could happen again [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3971.56s)]
*  um, but you saw with your own eyes, I mean [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3976.44s)]
*  how how much [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3979.4s)]
*  Is this a choice that is? [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3980.92s)]
*  In kind of inherent in the communist party like it dates all the way back to your father's service that [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3984.44s)]
*  We just can't tolerate there being different identities inside of china. So we have to repress people like the weavers [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3989.08s)]
*  Or how much of this is a guy like xinjiang coming in? [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3994.84s)]
*  And taking a different course and really cracking down. I mean, how should we think about [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=3998.04s)]
*  um [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4003.16s)]
*  The treatment of the weavers as is it something that's kind of inevitable because it's in the dna the communist party or something [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4004.6s)]
*  That's more distinct to choices that xinjiang has made. That's a great question [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4009.96s)]
*  And I would say that there's um, i'll give two answers set one is I think there is a structural problem with um with [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4013.96s)]
*  Governance of china today, which is and I think the title of my book [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4021.16s)]
*  I use the word empire and at the edge of empire that alludes to this which is the fact that in my idea [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4024.6800000000003s)]
*  China is the last remaining empire of the eurasian [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4031.32s)]
*  Age of empires when we had empires from the british to the french to the ottomans [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4035.0s)]
*  stretching across [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4040.76s)]
*  Uh this land mass and those empires all kept tight control [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4042.28s)]
*  of really diverse populations across vast geographic regions through force and because [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4047.0s)]
*  When the communists took over and also the nationalists before them they strove to [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4054.28s)]
*  Keep china in the form of what the qing empire was then there's an inherent [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4059.4s)]
*  Drive to use force. I think to keep these vast [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4065.2400000000002s)]
*  Areas of different ethnicities different cultures under control and so we're seeing what has happened in both tibet and xinjiang [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4070.44s)]
*  as well as in [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4078.2000000000003s)]
*  Mongolian areas and other regions at the same time there have been these debates [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4079.88s)]
*  Uh year by year decade by decade in the congress party about questions like assimilation [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4085.56s)]
*  So for example, even though they believe in keeping troops or large numbers of security officers out in these areas [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4090.84s)]
*  Uh, they don't necessarily at all times want to destroy the identities of the people there and there have been periods of [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4099.0s)]
*  Post 1949 history when people thought oh we need to let um, you know [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4106.360000000001s)]
*  Let them practice islam in a more robust manner, for example [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4111.400000000001s)]
*  But there are other times such as now [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4116.6s)]
*  when they're trying to eradicate some of the most fundamental practices of islam among people such as [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4119.08s)]
*  Forcing uighurs to eat pork for example or not [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4124.820000000001s)]
*  Practice fasting their ramadan or preventing them from making the haj [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4128.68s)]
*  To saudi arabia so like these very fundamental core parts of being muslim [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4133.8s)]
*  They're trying to prevent that and to root it out because they think that [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4137.72s)]
*  those [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4141.5599999999995s)]
*  accentuate the differences between [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4142.58s)]
*  these ethnic groups and [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4145.48s)]
*  the [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4147.48s)]
*  mainstream han population that's in [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4148.5199999999995s)]
*  in the interior of china, so [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4151.16s)]
*  So I think we see this uh [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4154.12s)]
*  this dynamic playing out over decades as [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4156.28s)]
*  things change [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4159.96s)]
*  One other thing I would say about c jim ping and his views is that he is very fixated on the breakup of the soviet union [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4161.32s)]
*  and um [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4169.48s)]
*  We heard him give this in a secret speech to party members right after he took power and we also [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4170.599999999999s)]
*  um [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4177.96s)]
*  And also as I was reporting this book and talking to some of your former colleagues Ben [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4178.599999999999s)]
*  Who were in the u.s government? [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4183.0s)]
*  They told me that when she met with biden when they both were vice presidents in china in 2011 [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4184.12s)]
*  They had a dinner [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4190.92s)]
*  Um at a hotel in chengdu in seochon province and in that dinner [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4192.280000000001s)]
*  um, c emphasized his views on the breakup of the soviet union to biden and [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4196.6s)]
*  I think he said [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4203.160000000001s)]
*  That china has to ensure that doesn't happen in its own country [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4204.92s)]
*  And so in his mind what that means is keeping tight control of these regions that have very diverse groups because [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4208.92s)]
*  As you know ben when the soviens started to when the central government started to take different policies in moscow [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4215.96s)]
*  Then many of the central asian republics were among the first to declare independence and those republics [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4222.52s)]
*  Culturally share a lot with singe and their turkic [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4228.660000000001s)]
*  muslim [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4231.72s)]
*  Regions and so I think china looks at that and it has great fears of the same thing happening and she especially has those fears [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4232.92s)]
*  Yeah, no, I I can say you know obama used to have similar conversations with she [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4240.280000000001s)]
*  Um [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4243.96s)]
*  not just about this piece of it, but also [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4245.400000000001s)]
*  Around the idea that you know americans are maybe individualistic [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4248.52s)]
*  But chinese are collectivist and it's the only way to to to govern china [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4252.76s)]
*  It kind of leads me to the hong kong question, which is you know, I spent a lot of time in hong kong [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4257.56s)]
*  during the protest movement and [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4261.4800000000005s)]
*  Uh, and if to this day i'm trying to digest that experience [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4264.12s)]
*  Um [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4268.36s)]
*  And to understand it, you know, everything the chinese government does is a message right and the kind of total [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4269.48s)]
*  Stamping out of any shred of dissent and this kind of willingness to kind of terminate [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4277.0s)]
*  The kind of city hong kong used to be which was this kind of bridge between east and west. Um [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4281.72s)]
*  Uh, how how should how did you you you write? [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4287.5599999999995s)]
*  You know about your reporting there and you know fulfilled with kind of powerful [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4291.88s)]
*  Anecdotes and images, uh of the kind of the dying days of those, uh, [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4296.2s)]
*  What was the kind of last gasp of dissent in hong kong? [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4301.4s)]
*  Should we understand that as a chinese government that is just seeking to kind of consolidate control and you know tie up loose ends from history? [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4304.36s)]
*  or [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4312.28s)]
*  Should we see that as the kind of irreconcilability of china with with the west, you know, I mean [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4313.24s)]
*  Would that be over reading it because that you know, I think to some people it kind of felt like [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4320.5199999999995s)]
*  a message of [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4325.32s)]
*  You know, not only do we want to control this area [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4326.679999999999s)]
*  But we're sending a message that we don't want any of this in our in our country any dissent any [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4328.5199999999995s)]
*  diversity [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4334.66s)]
*  um [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4335.719999999999s)]
*  How do you digest hong kong based on your reporting and your family's history there? Yeah [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4336.92s)]
*  um then the what has happened hong kong touches very [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4341.639999999999s)]
*  Personal accord in me because my family's roots are in hong kong my parents [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4346.04s)]
*  My father was born there even though he spent many years in mainland china and my mother grew up there [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4349.96s)]
*  And so like we through my upbring I talked to a lot of relatives from hong kong about what the city meant [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4354.68s)]
*  About the about how was this confluence of western and chinese ideas? [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4360.4400000000005s)]
*  I think you've experienced that yourself and know the power of that and I think that [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4365.96s)]
*  Again, this is a very particular thing in my opinion [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4371.72s)]
*  It comes down to cijin ping again because I think in different moments in chinese history [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4375.400000000001s)]
*  there have been different approaches to hong kong and [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4380.12s)]
*  Let's bring up c's father again c jong xin [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4382.92s)]
*  He was sent by dum xiao ping who was the one who started the economic reform era in china to go down to the south and [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4386.2s)]
*  govern the area shenzhen which as you know is the chinese city right across from hong kong and so at that time [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4394.599999999999s)]
*  The chinese leaders were not looking at hong kong as a threat [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4400.599999999999s)]
*  to communist rule but in fact they were looking to hong kong as a model for how [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4405.24s)]
*  China could advance its economy could [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4410.52s)]
*  Adopt some liberal market principles and they could create boom cities in the south in places like shenzhen [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4413.96s)]
*  The same way that hong kong had boomed under british colonial rule [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4420.6s)]
*  And I think they were also [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4424.68s)]
*  Aware enough at that point that hong kong didn't wasn't a democracy and didn't have a democracy [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4427.4s)]
*  It certainly didn't have that under the british [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4432.04s)]
*  And so they thought that they could create their own model of that in that there would not be a democratic government in the south [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4434.5199999999995s)]
*  But but at the same time they could allow enough economic principles to flourish there [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4441.48s)]
*  to really drive growth in china [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4446.92s)]
*  but instead [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4449.64s)]
*  Xi Jinping has taken very different direction. I think what [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4451.56s)]
*  this goes back to his idea of the national security state it goes back to his idea of [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4455.0s)]
*  Fears or paranoia as some might put it about for influence and I think that [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4460.36s)]
*  he legitimately believes that [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4466.44s)]
*  places like hong kong are these [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4468.839999999999s)]
*  anchors or footholds by [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4471.24s)]
*  Western governments or western forces that are seeking to undermine china. I don't think he sees [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4473.719999999999s)]
*  Necessarily that a lot of the protests are this grassroots movement that have sprung up in opposition to increasing restrictions on hong kong [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4480.74s)]
*  I think in in both the public rhetoric that he's put out and in internal party communications [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4488.84s)]
*  It seems that they legitimately believe [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4495.08s)]
*  Foreign forces are the ones that have been stirring up the protests and trying to use hong kong as a gateway to introduce ideas [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4497.72s)]
*  into china [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4504.84s)]
*  To a degree I can see why they might think that because the south and southern china have always been this gateway [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4507.16s)]
*  For foreign ideas into china that actually led to topless of governments in beijing and the clearest example is sun yatsen or sun [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4513.719999999999s)]
*  zhong shan in chinese [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4521.4s)]
*  who [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4523.4s)]
*  Was from the south is from guandong province traveled overseas came back and then [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4524.28s)]
*  And while he was overseas really catalyzed a lot of the revolutionary ideals that led to the downfall of the qing empire [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4530.04s)]
*  Well that leads me to kind of one last question, which is you end the book kind of reflecting on [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4536.92s)]
*  not just [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4542.12s)]
*  you know your family and how they've [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4543.5599999999995s)]
*  Really kind of digested and dealt with and wrestled with and thought about the identity of being chinese [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4547.96s)]
*  But also you're obviously this bridge to an american identity and that raises the question of you know, that's on all of our minds [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4554.679999999999s)]
*  And I was just kind of wrestling with this myself and that the foreign affairs piece you know [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4562.5199999999995s)]
*  Are talking about which is can us the us and china coexist? [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4565.96s)]
*  Um [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4569.08s)]
*  And a lot in the world if not everything depends upon that. It's a huge [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4570.28s)]
*  An impactful question that everyone should kind of care about [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4575.08s)]
*  What did the experience of writing this book? [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4579.32s)]
*  As well as obviously continuing to report on this relationship. Where does that lead you in terms of your assessment of? [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4582.4400000000005s)]
*  Of whether and how frankly the u.s and china can coexist given, you know our our [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4588.68s)]
*  Respective ambitions, I you know the u.s is guilty of having pretty imperialist ambitions itself and wanting to control things [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4595.5599999999995s)]
*  China obviously is demonstrating its own version of that behavior [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4602.36s)]
*  Um, where where do you stand on that? [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4605.88s)]
*  Informed by the experience of writing this book. Yeah, I think that they can coexist in certain spheres. I do think for example [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4609.16s)]
*  Economic competition is uh is manageable [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4616.42s)]
*  uh, I think that um both countries could probably [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4620.04s)]
*  Reach some equilibrium in terms of like how they approach trade and the u.s will see its form of capitalism [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4624.04s)]
*  For example as a superior one, although we do see some chinese influences come in such as industrial planning is making come back [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4630.28s)]
*  Now in washington's, you know been there that notion of it. Um, and that's a very chinese idea of economic growth [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4637.48s)]
*  and at the same time china will have to grapple with its system and [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4644.28s)]
*  and then you can see these competing for trading the world, but [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4648.2s)]
*  I the point I think where [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4651.48s)]
*  Um, it's very that where it's it would be very hard to reconcile the ambitions of these two countries is [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4654.52s)]
*  Military dominance in the asia-pacific region, uh an issue that you thought a lot about then I know [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4660.92s)]
*  And I think the problem here is that the u.s wants to maintain its military edge [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4667.24s)]
*  Its military capabilities throughout the asia-pacific [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4673.0s)]
*  Um, it knows that threats can come from asia [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4676.44s)]
*  It we all live in the shadow of world war ii and we know what happened [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4681.56s)]
*  with japan [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4686.84s)]
*  Back in that area. I think the u.s sees china as a potential [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4688.28s)]
*  version of that [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4692.92s)]
*  darker japan if china [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4694.52s)]
*  if china's leaders move in a certain direction which [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4697.0s)]
*  c has um, you know because of c's [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4700.12s)]
*  policies then he [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4703.7s)]
*  Pushes american policymakers to think that way about china and um [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4706.12s)]
*  So america wants to military maintain military dominance there china, of course given where it's come economically and given [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4711.08s)]
*  its rapid military buildup it wants to have military dominance in the asia-pacific and [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4718.12s)]
*  That makes sense for a country like china. I mean it sees itself as a great power as an imperial power [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4723.88s)]
*  um, that's reasserting [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4730.04s)]
*  uh its previous strength and [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4732.36s)]
*  Asia is in its backyard. So, um, it wonders why should we be letting [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4735.4s)]
*  american naval ships [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4740.44s)]
*  American fighter jets have unfettered access to all these areas around us and potentially contain us [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4742.76s)]
*  It would be like if we saw soviet ships a soviet aircraft all around [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4750.04s)]
*  The coastlines of the u.s in our era and we know what happened when cuba became the nexus point for a lot of those tensions [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4754.92s)]
*  um, so [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4762.84s)]
*  That's something that I find very hard to reconcile and I think that [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4765.0s)]
*  This is something that whether it's a republican or democratic administration in power [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4769.719999999999s)]
*  They'll they'll really have to grapple with in the coming years. Yeah. No, I think that's uh, I think that's exactly right because uh, [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4774.44s)]
*  China's not going anywhere. Um [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4781.16s)]
*  and uh [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4783.4s)]
*  It's only natural that it it it would want um, you know a degree of influence in the world commensurate with its size [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4784.84s)]
*  But that that's right now butting up against the u.s [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4792.04s)]
*  well look and the one thing you can never capture in an interview about a book is [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4794.679999999999s)]
*  Uh the fact that it's really beautifully written. Um [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4798.84s)]
*  So one reason for people to check it out is it's a very you know, literary [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4802.28s)]
*  memoir and uh [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4807.32s)]
*  You also as you've seen from this interview you learn a lot about china. So [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4809.16s)]
*  Really? Thanks for joining us. Uh, thanks for writing the book. Um, again, I I I definitely recommend it to people [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4812.599999999999s)]
*  It's at the edge of empire a family's reckoning with china. Um, thanks so much for joining us [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4819.96s)]
*  Thanks a lot and it's always great to talk to you. Thanks. David. Lamy [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4824.84s)]
*  Uh, good luck to him in the labor party. Thanks to ed wong [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4827.96s)]
*  Good luck with tommy with the book release and we look forward to talking to you next week [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJYM5oy3D3w&t=4831.56s)]
