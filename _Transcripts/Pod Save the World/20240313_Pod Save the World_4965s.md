# Trump’s Flip-Flop on a TikTok Ban Isn't Convincing Republicans
**Pod Save the World:** [March 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I)
*  Welcome to Pod Save the World, I'm Tommy Vitor. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Ben Rhodes. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2.0s)]
*  And we have little flag things. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3.0s)]
*  Square, Pod Save the World for the YouTube audience. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  Pod Save the World things. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  Hey, you're welcome, audience. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=13.56s)]
*  Ben, feisty State of the Union. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=14.56s)]
*  When we were talking about it that day, I did not expect Joe Biden to come out swinging. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=16.36s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if Dr. Ronni's back in the White House. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=20.68s)]
*  Come on. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=23.48s)]
*  He never left. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=24.48s)]
*  Fiery. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=26.96s)]
*  Every single headline was like, fiery this, fiery that. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=27.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=30.16s)]
*  But essentially what they did is they picked like 10 to 15 fights and just, you know, put [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=31.16s)]
*  them together in one speech. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=35.6s)]
*  I like that. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=36.92s)]
*  It's the kind of thing that very well-meaning but annoying lawyers would have told us we [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=37.92s)]
*  were not allowed to do in the Obama days. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=43.0s)]
*  That's true, actually. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=45.64s)]
*  There was not a lot of hesitancy to draw contrast, which again, like I think it's the right move. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=46.92s)]
*  It's an election year, so you have to do it and it's a reality. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=55.0s)]
*  And frankly, on things like Ukraine, I mean, it's also legislative. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=57.92s)]
*  It's like they're blocking legislation. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=63.12s)]
*  Sorry, you don't like being called out on that. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=65.4s)]
*  Mike Johnson looked like he was kind of receding back into his chair and growing smaller. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=68.6s)]
*  Yeah, he looks sad. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=72.8s)]
*  Yeah, very sad, Mike Johnson. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=73.8s)]
*  Yeah, but the whole idea of like, I don't even remember what constitutes a Hatch Act [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=75.36s)]
*  violation necessarily, but Trump posted the RNC from the White House grounds. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=79.12s)]
*  So I feel like that should sort of end the discussion. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=82.92s)]
*  We used to get all these ethics briefings and then this guy's like literally having [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=85.88s)]
*  his political convention on the South Lawn and tweeting out images of the PDB from his [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=88.8s)]
*  personal Twitter feed. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=93.84s)]
*  Classified wrong details, yeah. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=94.84s)]
*  Anyway, well, we're going to talk about the State of the Union a bit more because we're [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=95.84s)]
*  going to talk about Biden's new plan to get aid into Gaza that he laid out in that speech, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=99.39999999999999s)]
*  Biden's Rafa Redline and Netanyahu's rebuke to basically all US policy, current and past. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=103.72s)]
*  We'll also talk about Trump's fake state visit with Viktor Orban down in Florida and why [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=109.83999999999999s)]
*  Viktor Orban matters and we talk about him so much. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=113.91999999999999s)]
*  We'll get into the fight in Congress over banning TikTok, some big political news out [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=116.28s)]
*  of Portugal and Turkey, kidnappings for ransom in Nigeria and an embarrassing failed effort [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  to amend Ireland's constitution. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=125.72s)]
*  And then what everyone's been waiting for, Ben, the Photoshop saga heard round Kensington [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  Palace. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=132.88s)]
*  Don't worry, we're going to spend a good bit of time. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=133.88s)]
*  I'm hoping for like 40 minutes. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=136.04s)]
*  We almost I almost proposed a bonus pod just on Photoshop. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=139.23999999999998s)]
*  Thankfully, it was close enough to Tuesday that I thought, you know, in good contrast, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=142.6s)]
*  I could wait not to get ahead of ourselves, but someone tweeted out a picture of King [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=147.0s)]
*  Charles with a caption, I too like to play with Photoshop and they just put a bag of [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=151.44s)]
*  sausages for his fans. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=155.64s)]
*  Some really good comedy here. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  And then Ben, you just did our interview. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=160.12s)]
*  What are folks going to hear? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=161.6s)]
*  Yeah, I talked to Renata Segura, who is the deputy director for Latin America in the Caribbean [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=162.6s)]
*  at the International Crisis Group. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=168.0s)]
*  We talked about Haiti, obviously a horrific situation. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=170.08s)]
*  And I thought it'd be good to have someone come on and really break down what is happening [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=173.88s)]
*  in Haiti. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=178.6s)]
*  Who are the key players? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=179.6s)]
*  Why are the gangs making their move now? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=181.28s)]
*  What can be done internationally? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=183.5s)]
*  What should the US be doing? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=185.6s)]
*  What should the political transition be in Haiti? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=187.36s)]
*  The prime minister is now acceded to this pressure to step aside. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=189.64s)]
*  So it's a really good lay down of what's happening and I wish there was better news, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=194.28s)]
*  but there's not. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=198.32s)]
*  It's pretty grim. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=199.32s)]
*  It is dark, man. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=200.32s)]
*  Over the weekend, I mean, just watching the reports of the gangs attacking the airports, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=201.84s)]
*  taking over basically all of the capital. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=206.72s)]
*  It's really scary stuff. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=208.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=209.32s)]
*  I mean, it sounds like from talking to Renata and ICG's had a person on the ground in Port [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=210.32s)]
*  de Prince, essentially the gangs control the city pretty much now, which is terrifying. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=215.06s)]
*  One thing before we get to our news on Gaza, I just did want to give a shout out to Mr. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=221.88s)]
*  Slav Chernov, the Ukrainian journalist and director of the film 20 Days in Mariupol, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=225.16s)]
*  which is about the beginning of the full scale Russian invasion back in 2022. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=229.32s)]
*  The film won the Academy Award for best documentary feature. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=234.44s)]
*  He was a guest on the show on February 21st. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=238.44s)]
*  So I think that had something to do with it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=241.07999999999998s)]
*  Can I make a point here? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=242.32s)]
*  This is the second year in a row because we had the Navalny director and some of the Navalny [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=243.32s)]
*  participants on for last year's Oscars and they won. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=250.48s)]
*  So Pods Say the World two for two. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=253.36s)]
*  All you publicist out there. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=255.52s)]
*  I was going to say, Hollywood PR people. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=256.52s)]
*  Keep in mind who delivers the Oscar. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=257.52s)]
*  It is this podcast. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=260.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=261.36s)]
*  You're trying to sell some new Matt Damon movie? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=262.36s)]
*  No. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=263.76s)]
*  Get him on here. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=264.76s)]
*  Come here. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=265.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=266.76s)]
*  Get Matt Damon on. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=267.76s)]
*  That's what I'm talking about. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=268.76s)]
*  All right, Matt, we'll talk about that. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=269.76s)]
*  Go fuck yourself. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=270.76s)]
*  Let's go to Gaza in the State of the Union. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=271.76s)]
*  So okay. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=274.84s)]
*  In the State of the Union, President Biden announced that the US is planning to build [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=275.92s)]
*  a floating pier off the Gaza coast to facilitate aid deliveries into Gaza. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=279.08000000000004s)]
*  It's going to take about 60 days or at least 60 days to construct this pier. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=283.56s)]
*  Biden says no US boots will be on the ground in Gaza. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=287.96000000000004s)]
*  So it's not clear to me, Ben, who's going to distribute the aid, who will provide security [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=290.44s)]
*  over this entire operation. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=294.56s)]
*  You have to imagine after Afghanistan and the tragedy at the Abbey Gate where a suicide [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=296.08000000000004s)]
*  bomber killed 13 US service members, injured hundreds more people. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=301.40000000000003s)]
*  The Biden team is going to be extremely worried about the safety of the people involved in [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=306.28s)]
*  this operation. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=309.71999999999997s)]
*  There was a report in the Jerusalem Post over the weekend that said that the idea for delivering [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=311.32s)]
*  aid by sea actually came from Netanyahu himself, that it was raised as far back as October, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=317.2s)]
*  was discussed by Biden and Bibi directly in January. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=323.0s)]
*  So I don't know if that's true or not. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=327.18s)]
*  Netanyahu refusing to let more aid trucks into Gaza because the Israeli far right opposes [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=329.56s)]
*  it and then forcing the US to construct a floating pier to bail him out kind of tracks [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=335.2s)]
*  with how he operates. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=340.64s)]
*  But what do you make of this proposal? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=341.64s)]
*  I mean, look, on the one hand, anything that can facilitate the delivery of aid into Gaza [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=344.23999999999995s)]
*  makes sense to explore. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=353.2s)]
*  If this gets more aid into Gaza more efficiently from Cyprus, which is where a lot of this [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=356.08s)]
*  aid comes from, that could help. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=359.91999999999996s)]
*  That said, this is one of those announcements that again, highlights the shortcomings of [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=364.08s)]
*  the existing policy, though, because clearly it'd be more efficient to just drive trucks [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=370.12s)]
*  across the border in Ra'afe. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=375.71999999999997s)]
*  Trucks that are waiting there, ready to cross. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=378.32s)]
*  So you're basically spending a lot of money and time, and you don't have time, by the [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=380.2s)]
*  way, two months, you've got famine conditions already, before an Israeli military operation [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=384.44s)]
*  in Ra'afe. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=388.88s)]
*  It would be better if you want to get aid in to just drive trucks across the border [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=391.76000000000005s)]
*  from Ra'afe. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=394.76000000000005s)]
*  And I guess you can't do that if the Israeli military operation is going to go forward [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=395.76000000000005s)]
*  in Ra'afe. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=399.40000000000003s)]
*  But if the US wants to get aid in, that's what I would be doing. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=400.40000000000003s)]
*  This feels like once again, we're kind of adding on to a policy that is not addressing [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=403.08000000000004s)]
*  the underlying issue, which is the military operation, the need for a ceasefire to get [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=407.44000000000005s)]
*  aid in. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=411.32000000000005s)]
*  That's the first point. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=412.32000000000005s)]
*  The second point is that on the administration of this, the US, I think, is still not kind [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=413.36s)]
*  of turned back on the UNRWA funding, which we talked about. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=418.36s)]
*  Other countries have started to do this, by the way. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=421.88s)]
*  I think Canada recently joined. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=423.40000000000003s)]
*  Sweden. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=424.64s)]
*  Yeah, Canada and Sweden. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=425.64s)]
*  UNRWA has the capacity to deliver aid. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=426.64s)]
*  All the aid delivery mechanisms in Gaza have been through UNRWA for years. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=428.72s)]
*  And the idea that we're shutting all that down to investigate these few people that [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=434.48s)]
*  were involved in October 7th, when again, as we talked about, there are thousands and [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=438.92s)]
*  thousands of UNRWA employees. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=441.68s)]
*  So we're building a pier while we're cutting off the aid delivery people in Gaza and not [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=444.36s)]
*  driving trucks across the border. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=449.32s)]
*  I mean, again, glad to have the pier, but that's really not going to make the difference [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=450.92s)]
*  that's necessary here. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=455.32s)]
*  I think that's why they're in that circumstance where the policies are not making anybody [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=457.56s)]
*  happy. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=463.28000000000003s)]
*  And that's why I think you've had a bit of a lukewarm reaction to this. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=464.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=469.16s)]
*  And did you see that Netanyahu is basically denying that there's near-famine conditions? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=470.16s)]
*  He did this long interview with Politico that we'll get into. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=473.4s)]
*  He said, quote, we don't have that kind of information. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=475.35999999999996s)]
*  That's not the information we have and we monitor it closely. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=478.32s)]
*  More importantly, it's not our policy. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=480.67999999999995s)]
*  Our policies are to put in as much humanitarian aid as we could. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=482.32s)]
*  That's just absolutely not true. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=486.91999999999996s)]
*  Their own leadership was saying things like no food. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=488.88s)]
*  They were announcing the policy of cutting off food and fuel into Gaza. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=494.15999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=497.23999999999995s)]
*  And there's right-wing protesters blocking these aid deliveries and preventing them from [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=498.23999999999995s)]
*  happening. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=500.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=501.96s)]
*  You and I have talked again about this, but his ability to go on US media in particular [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=503.35999999999996s)]
*  and just kind of lie about things and do it in accessible language for the American audience [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=508.59999999999997s)]
*  is part of his selling point back home. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=517.96s)]
*  I'll be the front man for the far right in this country. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=519.4s)]
*  You'd rather have me on TV in the US than Ben Gavir. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=523.0s)]
*  That's kind of his last argument for being prime minister. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=526.22s)]
*  And unfortunately, it seems to be working for the guy right now. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=529.0799999999999s)]
*  So again, listeners to this show will not be surprised to hear the Biden and Netanyahu [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=532.76s)]
*  are not aligned on the big policy questions. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=535.84s)]
*  But that fact was spelled out again over the weekend in these a pair of interviews. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=539.16s)]
*  So the first big difference is over the potential Israeli invasion of Ra'a, which is that city [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=543.2s)]
*  in southern Gaza where 1.4 million people are sheltering and as Ben just mentioned, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=549.72s)]
*  where aid crosses from Egypt into Gaza. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=553.96s)]
*  During an interview with MSNBC on Saturday, President Biden said an Israeli invasion of [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=556.76s)]
*  Ra'a was a red line for him. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=561.56s)]
*  Here's a clip. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=563.48s)]
*  I'm never going to leave Israel. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=564.48s)]
*  The defense of Israel is still critical. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=565.96s)]
*  So there's no red line. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=567.96s)]
*  I'm going to cut off all weapons so they don't have the Iron Dome to protect them. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=569.6s)]
*  They don't have. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=573.16s)]
*  But there's red lines that if it crosses and they cannot have 30,000 more Palestinians [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=574.28s)]
*  dead as a consequence of going out. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=580.16s)]
*  There's other ways to deal to get to to deal with the with with the trauma caused by Hamas. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=582.52s)]
*  Like red line ish. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=590.88s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=592.6s)]
*  And I mean, I don't know if he meant to state it exactly as he did. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=593.24s)]
*  It's like a highlighter. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=596.72s)]
*  Basically saying, if there are another 30,000 people killed on top of the already 30,000 [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=597.6s)]
*  people that killed, then that'd be a red line. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=602.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, it didn't I don't know. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=604.2s)]
*  They kind of walked back the idea of a red line. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=606.08s)]
*  And I think the U.S. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=607.88s)]
*  Press has gotten addicted to the red lines. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=608.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=610.88s)]
*  No president should ever say the word red line again. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=611.76s)]
*  But look, what I take away from it substantively is he's trying to say that the Israeli military [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=616.28s)]
*  operation in a Rafa would be some kind of breaking point. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=622.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=626.28s)]
*  Vis-a-vis Netanyahu. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=626.6800000000001s)]
*  I think the question is, well, first of all, I think that should have already happened. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=628.2s)]
*  We've talked about and you're prepping for the show, Tommy. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=632.88s)]
*  I mean, it's frustrating. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=635.16s)]
*  We've been talking about these differences on the military operation, Rafa and the Palestinian [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=636.5600000000001s)]
*  state issue for a long time. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=642.08s)]
*  These differences have been pretty obvious staring us in the face for a while. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=643.4s)]
*  And the challenge here is that they seem to not want to admit that they need to change [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=648.04s)]
*  their policy. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=652.36s)]
*  And you've been in the White House. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=654.0s)]
*  It's hard to come out and say, you know what, we tried it this way. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=655.16s)]
*  We tried to kind of hug Bibi and counsel him in private. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=657.28s)]
*  And that didn't work. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=660.5600000000001s)]
*  And so now we're changing. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=661.44s)]
*  And instead, you're always kind of trying to explain why this is no, this is an evolution [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=663.08s)]
*  of the policy. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=666.96s)]
*  But I think what he's saying is that there'll be some consequence if the military operation [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=668.96s)]
*  and Rafa goes forward. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=673.24s)]
*  What that consequence is, I mean, he kind of for the first time hinted at certain restrictions [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=675.2s)]
*  on weapons. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=681.2s)]
*  I mean, because he notably said, I would never cut off the Iron Dome. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=682.2s)]
*  It's a missile defense. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=685.52s)]
*  Which is missile defense. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=686.52s)]
*  Which, like, that's defensible. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=687.52s)]
*  Nobody has said, you know, Bernie Sanders, who's been the most outspoken and I think [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=688.76s)]
*  in line with our position in terms of saying cut off military assistance, even Bernie said, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=693.28s)]
*  we can keep giving them the Iron Dome because you want to protect against rockets. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=697.52s)]
*  But the question is, would you cut off all offensive military assistance? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=701.04s)]
*  I think you should. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=704.92s)]
*  Would you vote for a ceasefire resolution of the United Nations? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=706.06s)]
*  I think you should. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=708.76s)]
*  I think we should be doing that now, frankly. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=709.76s)]
*  So the question remains for Biden. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=711.74s)]
*  One, does the military operation and Rafa go forward? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=714.12s)]
*  And if it does, how substantive is this break? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=716.9s)]
*  I think, you know, just saying we don't like this and we don't like Netanyahu is not going [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=720.0799999999999s)]
*  to cut it anymore and never was going to cut it. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=725.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=727.7199999999999s)]
*  And it gets worse. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=728.7199999999999s)]
*  On Sunday, Netanyahu was asked about Rafa during this interview he did with Axel Springer, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=729.72s)]
*  which is the parent company of Politico. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=734.24s)]
*  When asked about a Rafa invasion, he said, we'll go there. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=737.0s)]
*  We're not going to leave them, them being the remaining Hamas forces in Rafa. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=739.44s)]
*  Netanyahu then seemed to respond to Biden's red line comments. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=744.08s)]
*  Here's a clip. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=747.24s)]
*  We'll go there. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=748.24s)]
*  We're not going to leave them. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=749.24s)]
*  You know, I have a red line. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=750.24s)]
*  You know what the red line is? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=751.24s)]
*  That October 7th doesn't happen again. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=753.08s)]
*  Never happens again. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=756.0s)]
*  And to do that, we have to complete the destruction of the Hamas terrorist army. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=757.08s)]
*  In that interview, Bibi also firmly rejected a two-state solution, saying, quote, Israeli [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=762.64s)]
*  people also support my position that says that we should resoundingly reject the attempt [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=768.08s)]
*  to ram down our throats a Palestinian state. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=772.5s)]
*  That is something that they agree on. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=775.6s)]
*  So to your point, Ben, Axios reported that if Israel does go into Rafa, the US is considering [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=777.8s)]
*  imposing restrictions on some US-made weapons by the IDF. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=782.5s)]
*  They're considering not vetoing a UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=787.02s)]
*  ceasefire. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=791.26s)]
*  But again, I'm with you. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=792.26s)]
*  I would like to see those steps taken now to prevent this Rafa operation from happening. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=795.02s)]
*  And there's just kind of no one seems to address the broader, more substantive break on the [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=800.14s)]
*  creation of a Palestinian state. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=804.86s)]
*  They haven't even... [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=807.98s)]
*  Bibi and Biden have not spoken in nearly a month. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=809.66s)]
*  They're clearly not aligned on short-term and long-term strategy. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=813.46s)]
*  And yet, like you said, it does feel like the US policy is kind of just on autopilot. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=818.1s)]
*  It's on autopilot. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=822.72s)]
*  And again, it's because you would have to acknowledge that the approach of hugging Bibi, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=823.72s)]
*  which is literally their stated policy, hasn't worked. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=828.62s)]
*  Do you want to hug that guy? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=832.62s)]
*  I don't want to hug that guy. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=833.62s)]
*  No, he's creepy as fuck. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=834.62s)]
*  He's creepy as fuck. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=835.62s)]
*  Like he's saying this redline macho talk that he does, they don't need to invade Rafa to [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=836.62s)]
*  prevent October 7th from happening. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=843.3s)]
*  October 7th happened because Bibi fucked up, because Bibi let his guard down, because Bibi [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=845.38s)]
*  moved a bunch of troops from the border with Gaza up to chase around settlers who were [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=850.62s)]
*  committing violence against Palestinians in the West Bank. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=857.02s)]
*  So what Rafa would do is cause a humanitarian catastrophe. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=860.26s)]
*  And look, in terms of the bigger picture here, politically, first of all, Tommy, I'm beginning [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=864.42s)]
*  to have nightmares about what a tragic irony it would be if an American Democratic president [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=870.5799999999999s)]
*  lost reelection because he was unwilling to fully break with Bibi Nanyau. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=875.98s)]
*  That's kind of my worst nightmare in life. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=881.1s)]
*  But I think that that's a real consideration. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=884.5s)]
*  Obviously, more substantively importantly is the humanitarian situation and the policy. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=886.9s)]
*  I think what the US needs to do is actually start working on behalf of its own policy. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=892.14s)]
*  Right now, it's been trying to convince Israel to support things that Bibi doesn't support. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=896.34s)]
*  Don't go into Rafa, support a Palestinian state. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=902.5s)]
*  We should have a view. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=905.5400000000001s)]
*  We want to move aid into Rafa with trucks. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=906.82s)]
*  We want to start working for the construction of a Palestinian state, which has been US [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=909.86s)]
*  policy for over two decades. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=912.86s)]
*  This is not ramming down and throw it something that the whole world has supported for a very [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=915.62s)]
*  long time. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=919.38s)]
*  And just start working in that direction. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=920.86s)]
*  And if you have to work around Bibi, you have to work around him. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=922.54s)]
*  Would I prefer an Israeli government that is a partner in that? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=926.22s)]
*  Sure. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=928.62s)]
*  And by working around it, I mean just what is a vehicle for getting aid into Gaza? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=929.82s)]
*  What is the kind of work that needs to be done to build up an alternative Palestinian [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=935.34s)]
*  leadership? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=939.22s)]
*  What is the option on the table for some kind of recognition de facto or more specific of [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=940.1s)]
*  Palestinian borders for a state? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=946.06s)]
*  These are things where the US can have a view. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=948.4599999999999s)]
*  And just thinking you're going to get Bibi to go along with it. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=951.9799999999999s)]
*  I mean, this guy's going to... [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=954.18s)]
*  He's full of shit. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=956.26s)]
*  He's full of shit. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=957.26s)]
*  He wants Joe Biden to lose the election. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=958.26s)]
*  He does. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=959.26s)]
*  He said not going to Rafa would be the equivalent of Allied forces in World War II not going [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=960.26s)]
*  to Berlin. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=962.8199999999999s)]
*  That is the craziest comparison I've ever heard. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=964.9s)]
*  Berlin, post-World War I, Germany is not the same as a couple million people who are trapped [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=967.8199999999999s)]
*  in a tiny little sliver of the Gaza Strip. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=972.54s)]
*  Also, Ben, we have both dealt with the people online who constantly suggest that all the [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=975.58s)]
*  death tolls that come out of Gaza are made up because it's from the Hamas-run health [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=980.58s)]
*  ministry. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=985.62s)]
*  In that interview that Netanyahu did with Axel Springer, he says that Israel has killed [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=986.7s)]
*  13,000 Hamas fighters and that they've also killed maybe one to one and a half civilians [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=990.94s)]
*  per combatant, which would put the total number of deaths at 26,000, which is right around [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=997.54s)]
*  the point where the Hamas health ministry says. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1004.3s)]
*  I think everyone agree, probably everyone who's watching this closely thinks the actual [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1006.46s)]
*  death toll is much, much higher than that. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1011.22s)]
*  But for all the truthers out there, Bibi Netanyahu thinks that at least 26,000 people have been [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1013.54s)]
*  killed in this conflict in five months. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1018.22s)]
*  And 15,000 children have been killed. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1020.18s)]
*  So the Hamas combatant figure doesn't add up, you know, unless you think a bunch of, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1022.1s)]
*  you know, I mean, it's just it's gross that we're arguing about what, you know, fine. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1027.94s)]
*  How many children is enough for you? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1033.02s)]
*  You know, like what is too much? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1035.02s)]
*  I mean, this this is not working people, you know. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1036.22s)]
*  And again, we've said this every time I say it again, like the hostages, if that's your [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1039.02s)]
*  concern, you're not going to get them. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1043.54s)]
*  You're not going to free them more efficiently through invading Ra'afet than you would through [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1045.6200000000001s)]
*  a negotiation. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1050.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1051.06s)]
*  Two other strange things. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1052.06s)]
*  So in that interview, Netanyahu seemed to leave open the possibility of extending military [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1053.06s)]
*  operations into Lebanon. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1058.02s)]
*  Yes, the people who evacuated northern Lebanon want to go home. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1059.54s)]
*  But he said, you know, if we need to make sure they're safe through military means, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1062.34s)]
*  we'll do so. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1065.3799999999999s)]
*  The other strange thing that happened today. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1066.74s)]
*  So every year, the intelligence community does this annual threat assessment where they [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1067.86s)]
*  release this 40 page unclassified document of all the threats in the world. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1072.86s)]
*  And then they testify. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1076.1399999999999s)]
*  And it's this bizarre. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1076.98s)]
*  I don't know why they do it. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1079.02s)]
*  To be totally honest, to give the press like scary stories to write for. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1080.18s)]
*  Yeah, justify their budgets. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1084.1s)]
*  But in the threat assessment document that came out on Monday, the DNI, the director [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1085.98s)]
*  of national intelligence cited concerns about distrust of Netanyahu's ability to rule. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1092.98s)]
*  And it questioned his viability as a leader, as well as his governing coalition going [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1098.78s)]
*  forward, which was noticed and not appreciated by Netanyahu's government. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1103.1s)]
*  But you've also seen huge protest in Israel against Netanyahu's government. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1108.7s)]
*  I mean, thousands and thousands of people on the street demanding elections on the [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1113.06s)]
*  basis that Netanyahu failed and kind of lost his legitimacy because of what happened on [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1117.18s)]
*  October 7th and obviously because he's flailing around now. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1121.34s)]
*  And so, you know, this is not just the opinion of the U.S. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1124.94s)]
*  intelligence community. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1130.1s)]
*  Netanyahu's approval ratings have been very low. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1130.7s)]
*  He clearly doesn't have the confidence of large numbers of the Israeli people, even [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1133.54s)]
*  Israeli people who may support a military operation. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1137.5s)]
*  So, you know, it's one of those. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1140.38s)]
*  I mean, the other thing that was in that report is that the United States might face [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1142.3s)]
*  an increased threat around the world because of its support for Israel, which, again, is [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1146.1s)]
*  not a surprise. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1150.4199999999998s)]
*  But, you know, some things are, you know, need to be stated, obviously. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1151.7s)]
*  Yeah. One last clip that's worth hearing from Biden's interview on MSNBC. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1155.86s)]
*  What's happening is he has a right to defend Israel, a right to continue to pursue [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1160.5s)]
*  Hamas. But he must, he must, he must pay more attention to the innocent lives being [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1165.7s)]
*  lost as a consequence of the actions taken. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1170.98s)]
*  He's hurting, in my view, he's hurting Israel more than helping Israel by making [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1173.46s)]
*  the rest of the world. It's contrary to what Israel stands for. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1180.06s)]
*  And I think it's a big mistake. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1183.42s)]
*  I mean, like. Accurate, a good observation. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1184.98s)]
*  I just, you know, I think that needs to be if you really think he's hurting Israel, then [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1189.9s)]
*  let's back that with action. I think that's sort of the final word. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1192.9s)]
*  Yeah, we're not a passive actor. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1194.8200000000002s)]
*  I mean, the final word I'd say is that we're supplying a lot of, if not most of the [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1196.38s)]
*  offensive weapons that they're using to to hurt Israel. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1199.86s)]
*  So so, you know, it's not just commenting on something that that we are not a part [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1202.74s)]
*  of. You know, we have we should be able to use our leverage if we think what they're [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1207.2199999999998s)]
*  doing is right. You know, the substance has to follow that comment. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1212.78s)]
*  You know. Yeah. Well, hopefully, there'll be better news on this next week. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1215.5s)]
*  I mean, everyone is hoping there'd be a ceasefire before. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1219.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that'd be great. I mean, let's hope that they pull that off. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1221.02s)]
*  That'd be the best possible outcome. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1224.1s)]
*  OK, then let's turn to tomorrow Lago, because we talk a lot about Hungarian [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1225.78s)]
*  dictator, soft fascist is what people like to call him. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1231.62s)]
*  Victor Orban on the show. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1234.9s)]
*  We cover him for a bunch of reasons. He's a Putin stooge. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1236.66s)]
*  He's a huge pain in the ass for the European Union, for NATO. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1239.46s)]
*  He was at the vanguard of demagoguing Muslims and refugees to gain political power. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1242.98s)]
*  And he's also seen by conservatives, especially Republicans in the U.S., as the [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1249.1s)]
*  model for how to crush democracy, cement your control over a country and [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1254.58s)]
*  pervert or destroy its institutions. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1259.74s)]
*  So, again, that brings us to Mar Lago, where Trump hosted Orban and his daughter [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1261.46s)]
*  for like a pretend state visit last week. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1265.62s)]
*  Yeah. Here's a clip of Trump praising Orban to the assembled audience. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1268.02s)]
*  There's nobody that's better, smarter or a better leader than Victor Orban. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1273.3799999999999s)]
*  He's fantastic. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1278.8999999999999s)]
*  As you know, the prime minister of Hungary. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1281.06s)]
*  And does a great job. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1284.5s)]
*  He's a non controversial figure because he said this is the way it's going to be. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1286.06s)]
*  And that's the end of it. Right. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1289.8999999999999s)]
*  He's the boss. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1291.78s)]
*  And now he's a great leader, fantastic leader in Europe and all over the world. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1292.98s)]
*  The music is softly playing. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1298.1799999999998s)]
*  The soul man. I'm a big Sam and Dave guy, but like. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1300.26s)]
*  Trouble. He also just sounds so jealous whenever he's talking about like [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1305.46s)]
*  Xi Jinping or any dictator that could just roll by. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1308.5s)]
*  Anyway, so Orban, you know, does the whole reach around on social media afterward. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1311.78s)]
*  He says Trump commanded respect in the world, created the conditions for peace [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1316.46s)]
*  during his presidency. There was peace in the Middle East and peace in Ukraine. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1320.58s)]
*  We need him back more than ever. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1323.54s)]
*  Orban also told Hungarian state media that Trump is a man of peace. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1325.58s)]
*  You will not give a penny in the Ukraine Russia war. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1329.3400000000001s)]
*  Therefore, the war will end because it's so obvious that Ukraine cannot stand [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1331.9s)]
*  on its own feet. So I don't like everything about this. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1335.3s)]
*  It's just so weird that you're just doing a cosplay state visit at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1338.06s)]
*  Everything from like the arrival photos to the flags, to the motorcades driving up. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1343.6599999999999s)]
*  Like I said, the Sam and Dave soundtrack. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1348.7s)]
*  You don't know what the make of this. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1350.74s)]
*  All right. I haven't done a book plug in a while. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1352.6599999999999s)]
*  OK, but, you know, to those of you who are newer, world is. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1354.34s)]
*  I wrote a book a few years ago, a few years ago, and I kind of we're getting old. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1358.82s)]
*  Called After the Fall, about the rise of authoritarianism in the world. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1363.1399999999999s)]
*  And it had started with a huge section on Hungary because Hungary is the template [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1366.1s)]
*  that Republicans have used. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1371.6999999999998s)]
*  And again, to be specific, the way that started is, you know, essentially, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1372.74s)]
*  Orban gets elected [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1376.06s)]
*  a second term time in as prime minister in 2010 [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1378.86s)]
*  and, you know, packs the court with right wing judges, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1383.6599999999999s)]
*  redraws the parliamentary districts to entrench his party in power, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1386.6599999999999s)]
*  changes the voting laws to make it easier for his supporters to vote [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1390.1399999999999s)]
*  harder for his opponents to vote, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1393.4199999999998s)]
*  enriches some cronies through corruption, who then finance all this politics, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1395.26s)]
*  buy up the media and turn it into kind of a right wing mouthpiece, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1399.58s)]
*  use social media to villainize his opponents and wraps it all up in a big [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1402.98s)]
*  old nice bow of us versus them nationalism, you know, us, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1406.46s)]
*  the true Hungarians and real Hungarians. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1409.82s)]
*  Yeah, the real Hungarians versus the, you know, liberal elites and the Muslims [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1411.7s)]
*  and the, you know, immigrants and George Soros. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1415.54s)]
*  So it sounded very familiar. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1419.46s)]
*  In other words, like this literally is the playbook, the exact playbook [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1420.42s)]
*  that the Republican Party's been running in this country. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1422.86s)]
*  They want to turn this country into a one party autocracy [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1424.98s)]
*  that has the veneer of elections, but essentially all the levers of power [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1430.42s)]
*  are corruptly controlled by their party. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1433.3400000000001s)]
*  So we need to take this seriously because. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1436.02s)]
*  This is like having Mussolini at the White House in the 30s. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1439.14s)]
*  You know, like George Bush refused to meet with Victor Orban. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1442.3400000000001s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1445.3400000000001s)]
*  Wouldn't invite him for a stay, but Trump did in 2019. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1445.94s)]
*  Yeah, this is this is this is crazy shit. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1448.26s)]
*  You know, and it's all normalized, but look, literally. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1451.5800000000002s)]
*  This is, you know, announcing your intention to be a soft authoritarian. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1455.02s)]
*  Not even soft, really. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1460.5s)]
*  Victor Orban can be pretty hard asked about it. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1461.38s)]
*  Never mind the fact that, you know, cutting off all aid to Ukraine [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1464.3s)]
*  and quote unquote, ending the war notes, ending, you know, Ukraine's capacity [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1468.78s)]
*  to resist Vymer Putin. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1472.22s)]
*  So these are things that have like very high stakes. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1474.26s)]
*  And sometimes they can seem less like that because there's this kind of comical [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1476.8600000000001s)]
*  facade of Mar-a-Lago and the soul man playing in the backdrop. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1480.8600000000001s)]
*  But like, you know, I think I'd take it pretty seriously. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1484.02s)]
*  You know, it's just it is worth watching. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1486.7s)]
*  I mean, it's CPAC and all these other events. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1488.5s)]
*  Javier Millet, I think, went to Mar-a-Lago. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1490.66s)]
*  There's just this little crew of kind of populist right wing dictators [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1492.9s)]
*  is always getting together. And it's not just Trump. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1497.26s)]
*  I mean, Victor Orban was in D.C. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1499.42s)]
*  the day of Biden's State of the Union giving a speech to the Heritage Foundation. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1502.1s)]
*  Yeah. And this is to build on what we're saying after CPAC. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1505.18s)]
*  I'd like to see the center left and progressives [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1508.34s)]
*  and even like, you know, the occasional mods [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1511.6599999999999s)]
*  get each other's back like this. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1514.8999999999999s)]
*  You know, these people are not Victor Orban is not nervous about [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1516.4199999999998s)]
*  defying Joe Biden and endorsing Donald Trump. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1520.1399999999999s)]
*  Like we should do more in this country and around the world [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1522.6999999999998s)]
*  to kind of spotlight, support, platform good leaders of even smaller countries. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1526.4599999999998s)]
*  You know, they've gone a long way to building up Victor Orban [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1532.54s)]
*  and his stature globally. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1535.3s)]
*  We don't do the same thing when we have like a, you know, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1536.86s)]
*  just send Ardern in New Zealand or you've had some pretty good leaders recently [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1539.8999999999999s)]
*  and in Central and Eastern Europe. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1544.1s)]
*  Like we got some good young progressive leaders in Latin America. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1546.4599999999998s)]
*  I'd just like to see us do more to support one other in the way that they do, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1550.78s)]
*  maybe without the Mar-a-Lago backdrop and the the Soulman soundtrack. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1554.4599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, maybe you don't need a different soundtrack. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1558.54s)]
*  We have different. I mean, I like Soulman. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1560.2199999999998s)]
*  I Sam and Davis, you know, it was it was it. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1561.62s)]
*  No, it's hold on. I'm coming. Or is it so? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1565.74s)]
*  Yeah, sorry. It's hold on. I'm coming. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1567.2199999999998s)]
*  I don't know why I keep saying, I don't know. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1568.54s)]
*  I don't know the names of any songs. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1570.58s)]
*  I just know Spotify like pumps into my brain. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1571.74s)]
*  I just said I had that cassette. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1573.7s)]
*  I'm old enough that the Blues Brothers soundtrack, you know, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1575.18s)]
*  had a bunch of Sam and Dave, the best of Sam and Dave. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1578.82s)]
*  Yeah. Hold on. I'm coming. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1581.18s)]
*  Soulman like a bunch of good tracks on there. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1582.86s)]
*  So I recommend that. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1584.8999999999999s)]
*  Also old enough to remember when people freaked out about the Logan Act [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1586.22s)]
*  and, you know, people pretending they were conducting foreign policy on that. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1588.82s)]
*  John Kerry, like John Kerry, like met some European once [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1592.26s)]
*  during the Trump years and they wanted to throw him in prison. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1595.8999999999999s)]
*  And meanwhile, Donald Trump is like undermining US foreign policy. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1598.14s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Or one's like, oh, yeah, I'll cut off all aid to Ukraine. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1601.18s)]
*  In more Ukraine news, just worth quickly pointing out that [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1604.22s)]
*  the Ukrainian government is furious at the pope for seeming to suggest [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1607.46s)]
*  that they should surrender. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1610.74s)]
*  The Vatican says the pope was just advocating for a ceasefire deal [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1612.0600000000002s)]
*  and saying like it takes real courage to he said wave the white flag, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1614.94s)]
*  which certainly sounds like surrender, but, you know, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1618.14s)]
*  dev negotiations when you're losing and save lives that way. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1619.94s)]
*  And the Biden administration announced another 300 million dollar package [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1622.98s)]
*  of military aid to Ukraine. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1626.1399999999999s)]
*  CNN reported they were able to fund this tranche through savings [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1627.78s)]
*  in weapons contracts, which is a reminder that literally [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1630.74s)]
*  no one understands the Pentagon budget. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1633.58s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. So. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1635.2199999999998s)]
*  But it's also a reminder, frankly, though, that 300 million is not 56 billion, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1636.86s)]
*  which is a supplemental. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1640.98s)]
*  So there's a huge gap between being able to kind of cobble together [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1641.86s)]
*  the workarounds versus actually funding this. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1645.6999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. As long as we're on sort of threats to democracy. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1648.3799999999999s)]
*  Do you see that Trump is going to start getting intelligence briefings again [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1651.3s)]
*  now that he's a candidate? [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1653.78s)]
*  I saw that, you know, I don't know why you feel the need to [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1654.78s)]
*  abide by norms, you know, that when you're running against this guy, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1660.42s)]
*  how does he have a clearance? [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1664.62s)]
*  I when you steal classified documents [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1665.82s)]
*  and store them in your toilet and refuse to get them back, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1669.26s)]
*  talk about them on tape to like, you know, right wing journalists in Mar-a-Lago. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1671.62s)]
*  I would think that you would have a hard time getting the SF-86 clearance, you know. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1675.3s)]
*  But I mean, I guess there's a version of briefings that can change, right? [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1679.46s)]
*  There's one that has like sensitive information in it. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1683.82s)]
*  And then there's like a Cliff Notes of like, you know, here's the pod, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1686.5s)]
*  say the world version of the briefing. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1689.58s)]
*  You know, yeah, a lot of open source. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1690.86s)]
*  Let's hope it's the Cliff Notes version. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1692.22s)]
*  Just summarizing Wall Street Journal articles, the Vox, you know, thing. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1694.02s)]
*  But but yeah, I just I don't know why. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1698.3799999999999s)]
*  What's the downside to saying no? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1701.1399999999999s)]
*  Zero. Then Trump comes out and says he won't give me intelligence briefings. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1703.3s)]
*  And you just say, well, you read them when you were in the White House. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1705.86s)]
*  And you're literally under indictment for stealing classified secrets. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1707.82s)]
*  So maybe we shouldn't give you classified secrets. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1710.62s)]
*  Adam Schiff says he hopes the Intel community will dumb them down. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1712.78s)]
*  I think they already do that for the candidates, right? [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1715.26s)]
*  You get more of the overarching assessments than like the sensitive stuff. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1717.5s)]
*  That's true. Yeah. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1722.5s)]
*  Still a bad idea. Yeah, still a bad idea. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1724.18s)]
*  Because he'll still come out and talk about it. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1726.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And he'll probably try to hawk it to the door. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1727.74s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. All right. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1729.7s)]
*  Then let's talk about TikTok. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1731.1399999999999s)]
*  The House of Representatives is advancing a bill that would force ByteDance, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1732.22s)]
*  the parent company of TikTok, to sell all but 20 percent of TikTok to a U.S. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1735.5s)]
*  company or else it gets banned in the United States. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1739.4199999999998s)]
*  So this bill passed. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1742.3799999999999s)]
*  Remember this, Ben? [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1744.46s)]
*  The House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1745.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's the best name. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1747.8999999999999s)]
*  That's the thing that exists. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1749.8999999999999s)]
*  So the bill passed that that committee by vote of 50 to zero. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1751.54s)]
*  Well, I wonder how it got through. Yeah. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1755.5s)]
*  Biden says he supports the ban until recently. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1757.5s)]
*  Trump also supported forcing an ownership change of TikTok. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1760.78s)]
*  If you remember, back in 2020, he issued an executive order [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1763.86s)]
*  banning U.S. companies from transactions with ByteDance [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1767.5s)]
*  because they are worried it would give the Chinese government [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1769.82s)]
*  access to sensitive data on Americans. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1772.02s)]
*  It seems reasonable concern. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1774.06s)]
*  But just days before the full House of Representatives [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1776.1799999999998s)]
*  is supposed to vote on this new TikTok ban proposal, Trump flip flopped [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1779.74s)]
*  and he did it on Truth Social, saying, if you get rid of TikTok, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1784.46s)]
*  Facebook and Zuckerschmuck, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1787.5s)]
*  I will double their business. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1790.46s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1792.6599999999999s)]
*  Oh, so why does everything feel like 2016 again? [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1794.06s)]
*  I hate it. I were trapped. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1797.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, trapped time is a flat circle. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1800.18s)]
*  So Trump does hate Zuckerschmuck. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1802.38s)]
*  That's well known. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1805.54s)]
*  But a lot of people think that this change in policy [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1806.66s)]
*  might be good old fashioned corruption or donor influence. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1809.18s)]
*  So Trump met with a guy named Jeff Yass. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1811.74s)]
*  I don't know if it's Yass and Jeff Yass Queen. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1814.3s)]
*  He's a billionaire conservative. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1816.18s)]
*  He gives tons of money to the Club for Growth. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1818.26s)]
*  Why do these people come out of the woodwork? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1820.42s)]
*  There's always some billionaire, mega guy that shows up. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1823.1000000000001s)]
*  This dude, he funds the Club for Growth. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1825.78s)]
*  He has a 20 billion dollar stake in ByteDance. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1827.82s)]
*  So he's got a lot of skin in the game. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1830.86s)]
*  So Trump denies talking with Jeff Yass or Yass [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1832.3799999999999s)]
*  or whatever the name is about TikTok. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1836.3s)]
*  But yeah, so I mean, as you probably have heard from people, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1838.1399999999999s)]
*  I know, you know, TikTok has bought up every lobbyist in Washington, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1842.02s)]
*  including Kelly and Conway. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1846.6599999999999s)]
*  So like a good mob boss, I'm sure, like the deals happening between the Capos. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1848.62s)]
*  Anyway, here's a clip of Trump talking about why he now opposes [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1852.98s)]
*  the TikTok ban during a recent interview with CNBC. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1857.38s)]
*  There are a lot of people on TikTok that love it. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1861.22s)]
*  There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who who will go crazy without it. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1863.66s)]
*  There are a lot of users. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1868.7800000000002s)]
*  There's a lot of good and there's a lot of bad with TikTok. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1871.9s)]
*  But the thing I don't like is that without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1875.66s)]
*  And I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people, along with a lot of the media. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1880.46s)]
*  Whew. OK. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1885.1799999999998s)]
*  Just to round this out, the intelligence community in that global [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1887.98s)]
*  threat report that we talked about earlier mentioned TikTok. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1891.1s)]
*  It says, quote, TikTok accounts run by PRC propaganda arm [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1893.9399999999998s)]
*  reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1897.5s)]
*  during the U.S. midterm election cycle in 2022. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1899.8999999999999s)]
*  And it added that China is demonstrating a higher degree of sophistication [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1902.58s)]
*  in its influence activity, including experimenting with generative AI. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1905.78s)]
*  So stepping back, a lot of issues at play here. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1909.4199999999998s)]
*  The first is national security and the Chinese government, potentially. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1912.06s)]
*  Being able to get our data or just control, like the most important [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1915.1s)]
*  social media platform for young people in the U.S. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1918.54s)]
*  The second is constitutionality and whether banning TikTok is actually [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1920.8999999999999s)]
*  First Amendment violations. A lot of discussion there. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1924.82s)]
*  And then there's just this good old influence peddling piece [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1927.6999999999998s)]
*  and this billionaire maybe buying off Trump's position. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1930.2199999999998s)]
*  Any guess on what happened with Trump or what is going to happen going forward [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1932.74s)]
*  or whether you think this is a good idea? [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1936.62s)]
*  Well, the guess is on what happened, you know, it's probably a combination of, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1939.58s)]
*  you know, whatever billionaire is made, whatever deal with Trump. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1943.74s)]
*  I mean, sometimes the thing that's obvious is what happened. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1947.0600000000002s)]
*  Like maybe there's some super PAC is going to be a big contribution. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1950.0600000000002s)]
*  Some legal fees are going to be relieved. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1952.78s)]
*  I don't know what the hell the corruption is, but I'm sure it's there. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1954.6200000000001s)]
*  And we're doing the Vick Ramaswamy flip flopped the exact same way. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1956.74s)]
*  He called it digital fentanyl TikTok. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1959.38s)]
*  And then he got several million from this guy to a super PAC. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1961.26s)]
*  And then it was on digital cough medicine. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1964.18s)]
*  I think that also, interestingly, this time around, my [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1967.8200000000002s)]
*  you know, anecdotal interactions suggested maybe Trump is hurrying from his campaign. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1973.9s)]
*  The tick tock is maybe good for him. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1979.8600000000001s)]
*  You know, last time he didn't like to talk because there were a lot of like [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1981.8200000000002s)]
*  resistance comedians making talks about Trump or K-pop fans. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1984.7s)]
*  They're K-pop fans. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1989.1000000000001s)]
*  This time around, I think you've got a lot of Gaza content that is [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1990.5800000000002s)]
*  understandably upsetting and angering the very younger voters [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1995.0600000000002s)]
*  that are turning up to Biden. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=1999.14s)]
*  I think, frankly, you have like a bunch of TikToks that make fun of Joe Biden [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2000.94s)]
*  for being old and stuff. And so maybe Trump's thinking like, well, actually, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2004.3s)]
*  like TikTok might not be a net negative for me, might be a net positive. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2007.46s)]
*  My explainer in the Dalai Lama didn't do that well. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2010.38s)]
*  I don't know why. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2012.54s)]
*  Hmm. Well, like Uyghur genocide one didn't either. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2013.5s)]
*  Well, this gets to the thing I was going to say, which is and don't at me. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2016.14s)]
*  I know the TikTok, you know, brigades can be like the Swifties here. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2019.94s)]
*  So I'm very careful about how I state this. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2023.8200000000002s)]
*  But again, the thing that is for years, what I've heard from the people that, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2025.94s)]
*  you know, look at this TikTok, the algorithms that [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2029.26s)]
*  drive what content people receive are a black box in China, essentially. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2034.42s)]
*  And it is a platform in which what you receive is not as tied [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2039.7s)]
*  to who your followers are as other things, other platforms. Right. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2044.46s)]
*  Now, Meta, Instagram, [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2048.46s)]
*  Twitter have changed this as well recently, where suddenly you start to see stuff [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2051.54s)]
*  that's not necessarily what you follow. But TikTok, TikTok, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2054.58s)]
*  you're being fed a feed [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2058.5s)]
*  by algorithms that, you know, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2061.94s)]
*  nobody can see them except the [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2065.54s)]
*  the bite dense engineers in China. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2068.7000000000003s)]
*  And that's a legitimate concern. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2071.5s)]
*  Now, I don't think that the right outcome is banning it altogether, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2074.06s)]
*  because frankly, I think in all this information space, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2078.1800000000003s)]
*  one thing I've learned in the last few years is like, we're not going to like [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2080.06s)]
*  be able to turn back the clock to not having these platforms [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2082.62s)]
*  and not having disinformation campaigns. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2085.7400000000002s)]
*  But I think there should be a real effort to try to get some transparency [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2087.66s)]
*  around how information flows on TikTok, how the algorithms work. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2091.7s)]
*  The best way for that to happen is for there to be like a US [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2096.5s)]
*  owned subsidiary where the all knowledge, the data stored in the US, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2099.62s)]
*  but the algorithms are in the US where this is heading. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2103.14s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's the that's a that is a totally valid. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2105.06s)]
*  You know, you don't have to be a member of the [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2108.66s)]
*  that the select committee of the Chinese Communist Party to think [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2110.62s)]
*  that maybe if young people in this country are being largely, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2113.7799999999997s)]
*  you know, their number one information source is, you know, this platform. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2118.42s)]
*  And we don't really know how it works. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2122.62s)]
*  And it's emanating from a country that would want to fill young people [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2124.58s)]
*  in this country with division and anxiety, you know, that perhaps [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2129.3s)]
*  we should take a look at that. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2132.98s)]
*  And by the way, this is what the Chinese government Chinese do the same thing. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2133.74s)]
*  They force you to open a Chinese subsidiary. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2136.1s)]
*  That's right. If you're like Airbnb and you operate in China. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2138.62s)]
*  I should say that it seems like at the end of the Trump administration, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2141.9s)]
*  they were trying to force a sale of TikTok to Oracle. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2145.22s)]
*  I think Larry Ellison's a buddy. Ultimately, Oracle. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2148.46s)]
*  I think they could cut this deal where they would just sort of store [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2153.14s)]
*  American data at a place in Texas. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2157.02s)]
*  I think it's called Project Texas, actually, for what it's worth. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2160.22s)]
*  There's been a bunch of reporting since that that attempt [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2163.46s)]
*  to creating a firewall is completely failing. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2166.1s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal had a great report on this. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2167.8199999999997s)]
*  And this whole segment is drawn from great reporting by The Washington Post [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2170.46s)]
*  and CBS News and the journal, by the way. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2173.66s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, does what I in 2020, I felt like [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2176.18s)]
*  the conversation on a ban was a little more reasonable and understandable. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2181.46s)]
*  Now, four years later, you have people who have built like lives, careers. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2186.02s)]
*  Yeah, that's why I think the best outcome is not a ban. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2189.06s)]
*  But again, the two issues are data. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2193.54s)]
*  And first of all, just on the data point, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2195.34s)]
*  you know, the US will spend all this money spying on countries like imagine [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2198.22s)]
*  if you just had the massive data set of all the likes and [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2201.66s)]
*  yeah, interest, interest and, you know, anxieties of [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2206.14s)]
*  tens and tens of millions of Americans, like pretty good vehicle for data collection. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2210.74s)]
*  So you want to be able to store the data in the US. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2215.18s)]
*  And then again, you want to be able to understand how the platform is working [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2217.9399999999996s)]
*  through the algorithm. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2220.8199999999997s)]
*  And so that's the best outcome to work for. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2222.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, not not an outright ban, which I think would just piss people off. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2225.02s)]
*  And frankly, then it should be replaced by some other similar platform. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2228.06s)]
*  Yeah, he's not wrong that Zuckers muck's [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2231.34s)]
*  the most. The best line I've ever had, best line. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2233.5s)]
*  No one will ever top the the close to social network. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2236.86s)]
*  Mark, you're not an asshole, so stop trying so hard to be one. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2240.2999999999997s)]
*  The other good Trump [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2245.58s)]
*  nickname the other day was Slopinopolis. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2247.1s)]
*  He's got he's I got to say he's getting his game back after he's got it. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2249.42s)]
*  Desync pneumonia sharpening up his knives. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2252.94s)]
*  You know, election year. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2255.5s)]
*  So we'll watch this one. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2257.1000000000004s)]
*  The vote in the House should be on Wednesday, which is when this comes out. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2258.46s)]
*  The Senate has sort of a different view. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2262.54s)]
*  So we'll see if they can. Yeah, I doubt I doubt this will get through. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2264.02s)]
*  Then let's talk about some big political news coming out of Europe, [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2267.7400000000002s)]
*  starting in Portugal, which held snap elections on Sunday. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2270.94s)]
*  So the headline out of these elections is that the far right party, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2274.6200000000003s)]
*  the Chega Party, which translates to enough party, secured 18 percent [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2277.6200000000003s)]
*  of the vote despite being formed in 2019. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2282.1400000000003s)]
*  According to the BBC, they ran on immigration and corruption. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2285.46s)]
*  But, you know, the they will not be able to form a government. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2289.46s)]
*  But the takeaway should be that there is this growing strength [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2292.1400000000003s)]
*  with these far right parties as we head into elections [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2295.9s)]
*  for the European Parliament in early June. Yeah. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2298.46s)]
*  And then in Turkey, President Tayyip Erdogan told Reuters [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2300.6600000000003s)]
*  that the upcoming election on March 31st will be his last. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2304.3s)]
*  Erdogan was recently reelected to a five year term. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2308.34s)]
*  That was in 2023. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2311.38s)]
*  He's been president since 2014. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2312.86s)]
*  Before that, he was prime minister for about a decade. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2314.5s)]
*  So if he left the political scene, it would be a seismic moment. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2316.58s)]
*  But I don't know. He's also a liar. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2319.86s)]
*  So maybe we should. Yeah. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2321.34s)]
*  Well, I mean, on everyone, we'll see what he does. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2322.42s)]
*  He's also kind of like his son in law. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2324.38s)]
*  Like he's got like a nepotism structure set up. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2326.78s)]
*  And so he still might be, you know, whenever he exits the formal scene, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2330.18s)]
*  he still may be the kind of power behind things. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2334.82s)]
*  So we'll have to see how things go. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2336.5s)]
*  And, you know, the Portugal thing is in line with the kind of 20 percent, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2338.46s)]
*  you know, window that we've seen for a lot of these far right parties. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2341.8999999999996s)]
*  It's obviously concerning. You made the right point. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2344.58s)]
*  I think the barometer of the strength of the far right across the continent [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2346.7799999999997s)]
*  will be seen in these European parliamentary elections, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2350.8999999999996s)]
*  because that's the rare election in Europe where everybody's voting [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2352.74s)]
*  because they're voting for representation in Brussels. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2355.7s)]
*  And that'll be a real test of strength. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2357.7799999999997s)]
*  And then the next big turn will be the French election next year. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2359.66s)]
*  Or is it what year is it? 25, 25. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2365.62s)]
*  Well, the next big test will be the French election, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2369.06s)]
*  which is coming up relatively soon, where Marine Le Pen, you know, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2371.7s)]
*  has a real shot, too. So keep an eye on this. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2374.7s)]
*  Yes, scary one. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2377.46s)]
*  Also, this reporting got me just kind of Googling around about Erdogan [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2378.66s)]
*  and seeing what he's been up to. Yeah. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2382.8599999999997s)]
*  On Saturday, he said that Turkey firmly backs Hamas. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2384.4199999999996s)]
*  He said it's not a terrorist organization. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2388.62s)]
*  And he added, quote, Netanyahu and his administration [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2390.3799999999997s)]
*  with their crimes against humanity in Gaza are writing their names [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2392.8599999999997s)]
*  next to Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin like today's Nazis. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2395.66s)]
*  This isn't necessarily new rhetoric from Erdogan. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2399.54s)]
*  He also said that he was going to host Vladimir Putin in Turkey [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2402.6600000000003s)]
*  after the Russian elections. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2405.54s)]
*  But it is just wild that this guy's a member of NATO. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2406.6200000000003s)]
*  He says things like this about his really government. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2409.98s)]
*  He's welcoming Putin to town. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2413.0600000000004s)]
*  I mean, just friends like these men. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2414.7400000000002s)]
*  Well, what's so interesting about Erdogan, which we've talked about, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2417.0600000000004s)]
*  is he kind of he'll veer back and forth like he'll he'll have his like [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2419.54s)]
*  pro-Western quarter where he like goes to NATO meetings and lets, you know, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2423.5800000000004s)]
*  Sweden and Finland and NATO and does something that we like. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2427.34s)]
*  And then all of a sudden he's got Putin there. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2430.42s)]
*  So he just attacks back and forth. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2432.34s)]
*  And what's interesting, you know, stepping back, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2433.82s)]
*  a lot of these kind of medium sized powers are doing this more and more [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2437.38s)]
*  where they're kind of shopping around, diversifying, you know, Turkey, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2441.54s)]
*  Brazil, India, you know, they'll they'll they'll be buying Russian oil one day. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2445.7s)]
*  And then they'll be at a hedge in some bets. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2450.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, they're hedging in all directions. Right. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2452.14s)]
*  And I think part of the reason they're hedging is, well, one, they can, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2454.5s)]
*  you know, it's like a menu that they can shop from. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2458.7s)]
*  What do I want from the Chinese? [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2460.66s)]
*  What do I want from the Russians? [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2461.7s)]
*  What I want from the Americans and Europeans. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2462.54s)]
*  But the other thing is Trump, you know, I think everybody's kind of [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2464.5s)]
*  waiting to see what happens here. Yeah. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2468.14s)]
*  Breaking news based on a text that I got a while ago, but I just read [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2470.18s)]
*  apparently R.F.K. Junior said that his shortlist for running mates [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2474.02s)]
*  are Jesse Ventura, Jesse, the body, the mind. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2479.8199999999997s)]
*  Ventura. It's kind of like a wrestler. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2483.86s)]
*  Turned governor of Minnesota. Yeah, he's been. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2485.86s)]
*  And then Aaron Rodgers, Ben, your quarterback, New York Jets quarterback. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2488.34s)]
*  Care to comment? Care to comment on Aaron Rodgers? [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2492.86s)]
*  Well, you know, he'll probably like blow out his Achilles and his no jab. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2497.02s)]
*  When he's announced as VP, he'll blow out his Achilles walking out on the stage. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2500.98s)]
*  His best day will be his first day. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2505.1s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2506.3s)]
*  I mean, this whole like Joe Rogan wing of American society is [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2507.5s)]
*  is endlessly fascinating to me. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2511.5s)]
*  Actually, I saw Aaron Rodgers was recently on Joe Rogan. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2513.58s)]
*  Yeah. The guy, the irony of the do your own research guys, like not [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2516.2999999999997s)]
*  really seeming to do a lot of research. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2521.42s)]
*  Aaron Rodgers, not the kind of guy I want to do my research. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2522.94s)]
*  Bums me out. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2524.94s)]
*  Let's take a quick break and come back. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2526.2999999999997s)]
*  We're going to talk about Nigeria, Ireland and the royal controversy [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2527.54s)]
*  heard around the world. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2531.22s)]
*  OK, horrible news out of Nigeria where over the past few weeks, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2532.34s)]
*  hundreds of kids aged eight to 15 years old have been kidnapped [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2535.46s)]
*  from several different schools by criminal gangs. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2539.7s)]
*  It's just literally every parent's worst nightmare. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2542.3799999999997s)]
*  Unfortunately, these kinds of mass abductions have been an ongoing issue [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2544.94s)]
*  for Nigeria, according to a report in Al Jazeera. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2548.46s)]
*  Fourteen hundred children have been abducted in Nigeria over the past decade. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2551.46s)]
*  And then I'm sure a lot of listeners remember back in 2014 [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2556.54s)]
*  when the terrorist group Boko Haram abducted 276 schoolgirls [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2560.06s)]
*  from their dormitory. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2563.62s)]
*  That led to the very well-meaning, but ultimately unsuccessful [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2564.98s)]
*  bring back our girls social media campaign to this day. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2568.46s)]
*  About 100 of those girls are still missing. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2571.46s)]
*  Hopefully, with these recent abductions, the outcome will be better [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2573.98s)]
*  because unlike the incident with Boko Haram, these more recent abductions [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2578.02s)]
*  have been mostly kidnappings for ransom, where these militant [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2581.9s)]
*  not even militant groups, sort of a gang groups, kidnap kids, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2585.34s)]
*  ransom their families, return them months later, exorbitant costs. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2590.02s)]
*  Nigerian president Tanubu, who was elected last year [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2594.42s)]
*  after running a campaign promising to end Nigeria's security challenges [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2597.1s)]
*  and end kidnapping, condemned the abduction saying, quote, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2600.78s)]
*  The president directs security intelligence agencies [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2604.3s)]
*  to immediately rescue the victims and ensure that justice is served [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2606.5800000000004s)]
*  against the perpetrators of these abominable acts. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2609.3s)]
*  The Nigerian military says, you know, they're trying, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2612.02s)]
*  but they're spread too thin. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2614.1000000000004s)]
*  They're unable to combat all these armed groups and gangs [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2615.42s)]
*  who have been able to take over enormous swaths of territory [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2618.26s)]
*  and basically just torment everyone living there. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2620.9s)]
*  So just an all around horrible situation that we wanted to highlight [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2622.98s)]
*  and something to watch. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2626.94s)]
*  Yeah. And I think the broader context to watch, right, [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2627.9s)]
*  is one of the reasons why, [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2630.66s)]
*  you know, I was down at South by Southwest [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2635.46s)]
*  with this international crisis group panel and the head [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2638.5s)]
*  of the international crisis group Comfort Arrow was on with me. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2640.8199999999997s)]
*  And she used to be the Africa director. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2644.2999999999997s)]
*  And she was talking about the the coups in Chad and Niger [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2646.7s)]
*  and Mali and unfortunately other places. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2650.66s)]
*  And she made the point that one of the reasons why [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2653.22s)]
*  that has happened is you've had a breakdown in the big powers [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2656.14s)]
*  like Nigeria has its own instability, which makes it harder [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2660.58s)]
*  to kind of be this stabilizing force in the region at the same time [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2663.66s)]
*  that Libya and Algeria, which are above those countries, [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2667.54s)]
*  have had their own instability. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2670.34s)]
*  The bigger point being that Nigeria is a little messy right now. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2672.22s)]
*  And it always has had issues with violence and corruption. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2675.02s)]
*  But given the fact that it's bordered by Niger and Chad [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2678.02s)]
*  and it's the biggest country in Africa, the thing to watch is just, [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2680.7799999999997s)]
*  you know, does this kind of violence [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2684.34s)]
*  foreshadow or indicate like a larger growing instability [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2686.38s)]
*  or is it manageable? [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2691.62s)]
*  You know, that's the thing I'd watch. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2692.98s)]
*  In addition, obviously, just the human human cause. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2694.58s)]
*  On top of that, I mean, last week, we talked in depth about Sudan [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2696.66s)]
*  during the interview because of the civil war in Sudan. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2699.3s)]
*  You've hundreds of thousands of people fleeing to other countries, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2703.2599999999998s)]
*  including to Chad, which was already unstable. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2706.2599999999998s)]
*  Right. You had the president of Chad was killed a couple of years ago [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2708.74s)]
*  while visiting troops on the front line. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2711.9s)]
*  His son took over. There's sort of questionable legitimacy. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2713.38s)]
*  There's been all sorts of authoritarian things happening. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2716.06s)]
*  But when you have flows of, you know, hundreds of thousands [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2718.7400000000002s)]
*  of millions of people into a country, it's going to completely be stable. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2721.54s)]
*  That's the thing is this stuff can can spread. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2724.1800000000003s)]
*  You know, it's spreading fast. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2726.06s)]
*  This is not the important point, then, but love it. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2727.86s)]
*  Recently pointed out to us that Mark Robinson, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2730.98s)]
*  the right wing nut job Republican nominee for governor of North Carolina. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2734.46s)]
*  He's like a big Facebook guy. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2738.78s)]
*  Facebooked a lot back in the day in 2014. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2740.5s)]
*  He weighed in on the Boko Haram abduction of the Nigerian schoolgirls. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2743.3s)]
*  This is a thing he actually posted on Facebook. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2748.5s)]
*  George Storos stole them girls. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2750.7s)]
*  Eleven exclamation points. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2753.18s)]
*  This is a man who might be currently lieutenant governor of North Carolina. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2754.94s)]
*  He's already elected statewide. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2758.5s)]
*  Yeah, this is an interesting guy. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2760.34s)]
*  Eleven exclamation points. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2761.82s)]
*  A lot of hot takes. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2763.46s)]
*  My God. Yeah. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2764.54s)]
*  Fucking lunatic. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2766.18s)]
*  OK, let's turn to Ireland. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2767.5s)]
*  We're an effort to update Ireland's constitution to make it less sexist. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2769.54s)]
*  Somehow failed miserably. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2773.1s)]
*  Here is the backstory. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2774.74s)]
*  So Irish voters were asked to vote on two different amendments to the Constitution. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2775.7s)]
*  First, whether to replace language in the Constitution about marriage [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2780.18s)]
*  being the foundation of a family and replace it with a clause designed [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2783.18s)]
*  to make the definition more inclusive. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2786.5s)]
*  So it says that marriage and other durable relationships [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2788.42s)]
*  are the foundation of the family. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2791.18s)]
*  Seems reasonable. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2792.98s)]
*  The second thing they were asked to vote on was to remove language [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2794.22s)]
*  that said a women's duties, quote unquote, should be in the home. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2797.54s)]
*  That too. Yeah. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2801.1800000000003s)]
*  It's a little odd, you know, constitutional provision. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2802.34s)]
*  Real dated 1937 era language. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2804.82s)]
*  Also, 60 percent of Irish women already in the labor force. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2808.6600000000003s)]
*  So it's ludicrous on its face. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2811.54s)]
*  So organizers timed the vote on these two provisions [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2813.94s)]
*  to coincide with International Women's Day on March 8th. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2817.98s)]
*  But both of the provisions went down. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2820.9s)]
*  The change about women's duties was defeated with 73 percent of the vote, [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2823.9s)]
*  in part because the prime minister's proposed language [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2827.8199999999997s)]
*  wasn't what had been vetted by activist groups or citizens assembly meetings. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2831.34s)]
*  And the changes to the definition of family was defeated by 68 percent [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2836.18s)]
*  of the vote, in part because conservative activist groups said [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2840.06s)]
*  that it could impact land inheritance rights. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2843.22s)]
*  Somehow. I don't understand all this. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2845.18s)]
*  Turnout was low. Voters were confused. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2847.22s)]
*  The campaigning was bad. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2849.42s)]
*  So good news. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2851.1s)]
*  A better what run campaign seems like it could get this done. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2852.42s)]
*  Bad news until then. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2855.38s)]
*  Ireland is stuck with this 1937 constitution. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2857.02s)]
*  Yeah. No, I it sounds like this was just a poorly done campaign [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2860.3399999999997s)]
*  up against, you know, probably galvanized opposition. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2866.94s)]
*  But, you know, I mean, it speaks to the need to like, [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2871.18s)]
*  you know, when you take your shot. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2874.2999999999997s)]
*  Politics matters, man. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2875.7s)]
*  When you take your shot, you really got to aim and fire. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2876.7s)]
*  You can't just think that the obvious rightness of your cause [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2878.9s)]
*  is going to carry across the goal line here. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2881.42s)]
*  But I'm hopeful, you know, I love the Irish. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2883.06s)]
*  Still figured out I'm confident in the Irish. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2886.1800000000003s)]
*  Now, we do need to wonder why I constantly pivot us from stories [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2888.34s)]
*  about Ireland into royal stories. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2892.42s)]
*  I don't know that that's the best tick I have. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2895.14s)]
*  But here we go. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2899.98s)]
*  Well, it's I would like give the people what they want. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2900.58s)]
*  OK, including me, because I want to talk about this. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2903.62s)]
*  So you're our official royal correspondent. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2906.26s)]
*  Yeah. That said, thus far, we have avoided covering the stories [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2907.78s)]
*  about where is Kate Middleton in part, at least to me, it felt like [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2912.46s)]
*  an instance of the Internet being shitty to a person who was probably [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2917.26s)]
*  dealing with a health issue. Yeah. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2920.5s)]
*  But now bad Photoshop has forced our hand. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2922.82s)]
*  I regret to inform you that we have to cover this. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2925.6200000000003s)]
*  So here's what we know. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2927.9s)]
*  Kate Middleton has not been seen in public since Christmas of last year. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2929.94s)]
*  She had a scheduled abdominal surgery on January 17th. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2935.14s)]
*  On January 29th, Kensington Palace announced she had returned home, [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2938.46s)]
*  but she's not returned to official duty since. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2942.06s)]
*  Then her husband canceled an event in late February and it like set [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2945.1s)]
*  the Internet on fire and people started speculating about where they might be [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2948.38s)]
*  or what happened to her on March 10th. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2952.26s)]
*  The palace released a photo of Kate with her children for British Mother's Day. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2955.14s)]
*  The second it emerged, Internet sluice said that is Photoshopped [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2959.22s)]
*  and it was Photoshopped very poorly to the point where the Associated Press [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2963.74s)]
*  had to retract the photo, saying, quote, The photo shows an inconsistency [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2967.14s)]
*  in the alignment of Princess Charlotte's left hand. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2971.22s)]
*  That was not the only inconsistency. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2974.02s)]
*  There's Prince Charlotte missing part of her wrist, seemingly. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2976.58s)]
*  Kate isn't wearing her wedding ring, and it looks like her arms [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2979.74s)]
*  are like 100 feet long. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2982.18s)]
*  Is that part? Maybe that's just me. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2984.22s)]
*  No, no, that's that. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2986.3399999999997s)]
*  You just took one of my takes. OK, sorry. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2987.8599999999997s)]
*  She's a gummy arms. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2990.9799999999996s)]
*  The zipper on Kate's jacket doesn't line up. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2992.54s)]
*  There's blooms on the trees in the background that just obviously don't match [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2995.1s)]
*  the time of the year. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2999.06s)]
*  There's some people who even believe that Kate's face in the photo [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=2999.94s)]
*  was directly lifted from an old Vogue cover shoot. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3002.58s)]
*  The tweet laying out that theory got us 46 million views at this point. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3005.5s)]
*  It could also be the case that the the face in the Vogue shoot looks like [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3009.82s)]
*  the face in the photo, because that's what her face looks like. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3012.98s)]
*  But who am I to judge? [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3014.94s)]
*  Yesterday, Kate tweeted, Ben, like many amateur photographers, [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3016.46s)]
*  I do occasionally experiment with editing. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3020.14s)]
*  I wanted to express my apologies for any confusion. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3022.38s)]
*  The family photograph we shared yesterday caused [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3024.7s)]
*  Vox had a big analysis of all this, as they do. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3028.62s)]
*  Talked about Kate's reliability and how weird it is for her not to show up, [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3031.7s)]
*  because she always shows up. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3034.94s)]
*  She's supposed to be the reliable one. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3036.5s)]
*  She is. Yeah. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3037.82s)]
*  So I don't know, man. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3038.98s)]
*  Like she this woman, she posed for the paparazzi 24 hours [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3041.18s)]
*  after giving birth several times. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3044.7799999999997s)]
*  She doesn't know those fucking assholes anything. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3047.62s)]
*  I have to admit that I didn't really care about this. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3049.22s)]
*  Until I saw the hilarious Photoshop memes. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3051.9s)]
*  But what's your take? Where what's happening here? [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3053.6600000000003s)]
*  All right. I mean, I have a lot to say about this. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3055.6600000000003s)]
*  I mean, because there's a lot. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3057.6600000000003s)]
*  There's so many like track another drink. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3059.5s)]
*  So many. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3061.58s)]
*  No, but there's so many dimensions to this. OK. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3062.42s)]
*  So first of all, the explanation is is kind of insane. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3064.98s)]
*  Right. Because that the that she herself was editing. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3069.82s)]
*  I have. Well, first of all, they insist on telling us that William took this picture. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3072.86s)]
*  Right. Which is kind of strange. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3076.06s)]
*  These people have other people that can take pictures. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3079.58s)]
*  Right. Just surrounded by staff. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3081.54s)]
*  And and and then her ex. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3082.94s)]
*  Well, like everybody else, I wanted to play around with this. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3085.22s)]
*  When I play around with the photo, I don't make my arms like twice as long [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3087.42s)]
*  and cut out parts of my kids' wrists and hands. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3091.66s)]
*  And, you know, I changed the filter. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3095.42s)]
*  You know, I crop it a little bit like why would you edit your photo [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3097.7799999999997s)]
*  to make it weird and to remove body parts? [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3102.7s)]
*  And, you know, like I think what the theory is, is that sometimes there's photos. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3106.2599999999998s)]
*  A lot of people do this where, like, you take a photo of six people in a family. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3111.06s)]
*  Three of them look good. Three look bad. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3114.7s)]
*  So you grab faces from other photos and put them on. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3116.22s)]
*  Do you? Is that a thing? Oh, yeah. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3118.66s)]
*  Like that's because that's kind of weird. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3120.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, but they didn't just change your face. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3122.58s)]
*  Like, do you change your arms when you mean Gumby arms are sexy? [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3125.18s)]
*  I guess so. All right. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3128.98s)]
*  That's first thing. Second thing is small comment. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3130.22s)]
*  But like I remember when I was reading this, like [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3132.22s)]
*  the Associated Press describes revoking a photo as a kill notification. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3135.82s)]
*  Seemed a little over the top. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3140.22s)]
*  I was a little aggressive. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3141.18s)]
*  We have issued a kill notification on the Milton. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3142.4199999999996s)]
*  I was like, what are these people at the Associated Press? [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3144.8999999999996s)]
*  You know? OK, so we're just going to go into totally irresponsible speculation. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3147.74s)]
*  Right. I live there because basically, OK, what are like [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3153.18s)]
*  I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out the conspiracy theories. Right. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3156.4599999999996s)]
*  So there's the conspiracy theory, the sad one, right, [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3159.2999999999997s)]
*  that she has a real health issue and just as being like Lord Austin about it. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3162.4199999999996s)]
*  Right. This is like a Lord Austin situation, except a little bit longer. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3166.4199999999996s)]
*  And also in a job where your appearance is constantly judged [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3170.66s)]
*  and you picked in the most cruel way possible. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3175.4599999999996s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3177.3799999999997s)]
*  So you may not just want to deal with that if you're going through some shit. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3178.8599999999997s)]
*  And then that's the case. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3182.14s)]
*  Like that makes a lot of sense. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3184.02s)]
*  You know, the Internet, like Internet sleuths, as you'd say. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3187.3399999999997s)]
*  You know, there are all these other theories like is their marriage in trouble? [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3191.62s)]
*  Like is William up to no good? [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3194.4199999999996s)]
*  Like, you know, there are all these things that, [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3195.8999999999996s)]
*  you know, speak to the royal family's [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3199.74s)]
*  endless penchant for gossip. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3204.62s)]
*  What I will say about this is, number one, [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3206.2599999999998s)]
*  can we get some better communications people at the palace, though? [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3210.3399999999997s)]
*  Because like the communication strategy around this, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3213.02s)]
*  like whatever the answer is, they are not getting good advice here. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3216.3799999999997s)]
*  You know, like like like from putting out the doctored photo [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3220.1s)]
*  to kind of being totally opaque about this. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3223.58s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm always sensitive. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3225.8599999999997s)]
*  You know, like maybe it's not their fault. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3227.74s)]
*  Maybe they're just getting rolled by crazy principles. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3229.66s)]
*  We've all been there, too. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3232.14s)]
*  But so whether the fault is with the rules themselves or the staff, like [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3233.42s)]
*  there does need to be some transparency here. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3237.74s)]
*  Like this they're subsidized. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3241.8599999999997s)]
*  I mean, everybody rightly points out it sucks for these people that they get photographed. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3243.7799999999997s)]
*  They also get to live in a bunch of palaces and be billionaires [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3246.8999999999996s)]
*  without doing anything other than like showing up at ribbon cutting. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3249.42s)]
*  So it seems like there's a need to just be a little transparent. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3251.58s)]
*  And then my my my hottest take care of Tommy is [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3255.3s)]
*  man, like the Queen seemed to be holding this whole operation together. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3259.3s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of that. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3262.2200000000003s)]
*  That was like the the appearance for years was like, it seems like the Queen is really [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3263.26s)]
*  like the boss of the they called it the firm and she's kind of the senior partner. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3266.94s)]
*  You know, Queen exits the stage and it's like all hell's breaking loose. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3270.94s)]
*  You know, like Harry's got books coming out about fistfights with his brother. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3274.58s)]
*  He and Megan are still hanging out in Santa Barbara. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3278.62s)]
*  Kate can't be seen like not sure what Williams up to Charles doing his best. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3281.9s)]
*  But poor Charles now diagnosed with cancer. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3286.7000000000003s)]
*  I was cancer and we don't know how serious that is. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3288.9s)]
*  You know, like so just feels like or even what kind of cancer. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3290.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, we just don't know. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3293.38s)]
*  Yeah. So just the you know, it's not looking great over there. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3294.6600000000003s)]
*  No, it's scary. All we know is that Charles does not have prostate cancer. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3298.86s)]
*  We don't know what's going on. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3301.94s)]
*  So there is a real like line of succession issue. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3303.38s)]
*  And they probably know this whole thing. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3305.42s)]
*  They just need to be a little more like transparency is always your friend in communications. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3308.18s)]
*  Yeah. So what happens next? [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3312.46s)]
*  I mean, I guess you just have to figure out a time when you bring in the interview, [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3314.62s)]
*  some one friendly member. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3319.8599999999997s)]
*  Now I'll ask you the question as a communications strategist extraordinaire. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3322.2999999999997s)]
*  I mean, is the answer here like a sit down interview where they're holding hands? [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3327.2999999999997s)]
*  Is the answer like, you know, a carefully managed [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3332.2599999999998s)]
*  like, you know, documentary? [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3337.34s)]
*  Is it like a written thing? [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3339.82s)]
*  Like, what do you do here? [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3342.06s)]
*  Well, obviously, Pod Save the World would be number one to imagine if they had a sense of humor [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3342.98s)]
*  and they just started putting out hilariously photoshopped. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3347.54s)]
*  There you go. That's the other way to go. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3350.26s)]
*  But Snapchat filter videos all over their Instagram. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3351.82s)]
*  Yeah, like you have so much fun with this. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3355.06s)]
*  My daughter, when I FaceTime her now is figured out how to put like a lizard head on or an alien head. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3356.66s)]
*  You could do that. You know. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3362.1s)]
*  Yeah, Lizette really, really, really likes FaceTime, but likes to grab the camera and kind of like [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3363.42s)]
*  and sometimes wonders like when my mom was here in person was wondering why she wasn't in the phone, I think. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3369.26s)]
*  Well, I have to say, like, my wife's going to kill me for this. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3375.2200000000003s)]
*  But like, so my daughter likes to do the animal heads. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3378.5s)]
*  But the other day I was talking to her and like half the conversation, she's got the turd head. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3381.3s)]
*  And I'm just like, come on, can we just change? [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3386.54s)]
*  Can we go back to like the the dinosaur head or the cute dog head? [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3389.06s)]
*  This is not good. Yeah. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3393.46s)]
*  But they could do that. Kate could, you know, be like, call a press conference online and do that. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3394.98s)]
*  It would be so funny. And that would be funny. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3398.86s)]
*  Just release a bunch of terrible Photoshop. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3400.9s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, hopefully there's not something serious underpinning this. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3402.9s)]
*  No, no, no. Like the best case, right. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3405.42s)]
*  Is she like got a no job or some sort of elective surgery? [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3407.1s)]
*  You know, like hopefully it's something. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3409.86s)]
*  No, like we should be clear. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3410.94s)]
*  Like I've always liked Kate, you know, and she seemed like the rock. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3412.2200000000003s)]
*  Right. So that's why people are a little, you know, unsteady about this. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3417.34s)]
*  Dwayne Johnson. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3420.34s)]
*  John Cena naked. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3421.7s)]
*  That was a lot. That's a lot. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3423.22s)]
*  Yes. Like it's weird when people have like Audi abs, like your abs are so ripped, they kind of extend outward. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3425.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3431.42s)]
*  You know, you know what I'm saying, Alona? [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3433.3799999999997s)]
*  He's so ripped. It's like, what's happening? [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3435.62s)]
*  I feel like we made Alona laugh today more than I think she's just coughing. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3438.18s)]
*  Yeah, it's a wishful thinking. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3442.14s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3444.62s)]
*  But yeah, like, like, like, unfortunately, the best explanation would be the worst news. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3445.3799999999997s)]
*  Which is that she's really dealing with some issues and we hope that's not the case. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3451.06s)]
*  And if it's not the case, yeah, then do your advice. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3454.06s)]
*  Everyone is entitled to their privacy about all things medical. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3456.3399999999997s)]
*  So like I could imagine why you wouldn't want to release information before you're ready. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3460.98s)]
*  I mean, that's basically what happened to Lloyd Austin, right? [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3464.66s)]
*  You've got this scary news about his health. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3466.2999999999997s)]
*  He didn't want to put it out there. He's a very private person, whatever. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3468.06s)]
*  But when you're in these public positions, you kind of know that you don't know that this level of crazy is going to happen. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3470.7s)]
*  But, you know, when you're a royal, you know what the paparazzi does and the amount of speculation. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3476.62s)]
*  And there's this whole cottage industry built around you. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3482.38s)]
*  Well, and as as royal observer, you know, part of what Kate's usually been very good at this, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3484.8199999999997s)]
*  like Kate has been the one who's handled this like, you know, very elegantly for a very long time. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3489.98s)]
*  So so that that does make you worry that there's something not great going on. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3495.1s)]
*  Yeah, who knows? I mean, yeah, it was OK. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3500.14s)]
*  Well, that's all the speculation from us. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3502.8199999999997s)]
*  We're going to take a quick break. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3504.58s)]
*  When we come back, you'll hear Ben's interview with Renata Segura about the situation in Haiti. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3505.46s)]
*  So please stick around for that. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3509.3s)]
*  So last week, we talked about the situation in Haiti after armed gangs kind of banded together, stormed prisons, [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3510.58s)]
*  released thousands of inmates, fought with police. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3518.58s)]
*  The prime minister had been in Kenya trying to finalize a deal for Kenyan police forces to come to Haiti. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3520.98s)]
*  But then he was prevented from returning to the country. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3528.7s)]
*  And now the prime minister has officially resigned following a transition council being established. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3531.02s)]
*  The U.S. military is helping to airlift non-essential staff from the U.S. embassy. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3536.7400000000002s)]
*  Other countries have done the same. So it's a very chaotic situation. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3541.9s)]
*  Thankfully, to help us shed light on the situation today is Renata Segura, [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3545.98s)]
*  who is the deputy program director for the International Crisis Group in Latin America and the Caribbean. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3550.58s)]
*  ICG is obviously a tremendous organization that has helped us make sense of difficult events in the past. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3556.46s)]
*  So Renata, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3562.38s)]
*  No, thank you for having me. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3564.46s)]
*  So you and your team have done a lot of reporting on the situation in Haiti. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3565.66s)]
*  How would you describe for people that are not following it that closely just what has been going on in the last few days and weeks? [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3571.58s)]
*  What are the major players and what do they want? [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3579.2200000000003s)]
*  Why are they making this move right now, the gangs? [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3582.26s)]
*  So we have seen a radical change of strategy and really of what's happening in Haiti since last Sunday, a week ago. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3585.14s)]
*  Essentially, since the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse in 2021, we have seen a strengthening of the gangs. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3595.42s)]
*  We should probably note that gangs have been historically a feature of Haitian politics for a very, very long time, for decades. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3604.54s)]
*  And they have been a sort of private army for either political or commercial elites that have used them to further their interests. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3612.86s)]
*  After the assassination of Moïse, we have seen that these gangs have been strengthening. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3622.34s)]
*  They have been gaining more and more territorial control. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3628.1s)]
*  And we have also seen some separation between these elites and the gangs, in part because of the sanctions that have been imposed, [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3631.78s)]
*  particularly by Canada, on several very high profile politicians, including ex-President Martelly, [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3640.06s)]
*  that had sort of sent a message to some of the elites that they shouldn't continue supporting the gangs, at least not so openly. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3647.5s)]
*  So with that, we had seen a shift in the way in which the gangs had been operating and they had transferred their attention to really extort private companies [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3656.22s)]
*  and individuals and also kidnapping. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3668.86s)]
*  And they were doing that to make up for the lost revenues that they were not being, they weren't receiving from these elites. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3671.38s)]
*  However, until very recently, what we had seen was a confrontation between gangs, right? [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3680.6200000000003s)]
*  G9 and GPEP, which are the two biggest coalitions, were fighting each other to take control of more territory. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3686.2200000000003s)]
*  And more territory obviously means more power and more money. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3693.1800000000003s)]
*  However, as Crisis Group noted in the report that we published last January, there had been a building of a coalition between the gangs, [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3697.62s)]
*  something that Cherisier, one of the most notorious gang leaders, has called Viv and Sam, which in Creole means living together. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3707.22s)]
*  This was a very short-lived coalition that took place last fall, in which he had said, for the good of the people, we're going to stop fighting. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3715.62s)]
*  That fell apart very quickly. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3724.7s)]
*  However, we knew from sources in the ground that the gang leaders kept communications lined open [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3727.06s)]
*  and that they were thinking that they could bring together this coalition again if the multinational support mission that was approved by the UN [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3733.94s)]
*  and is being led by Kenya was to arrive or eventually to fight the state. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3743.18s)]
*  And so that is what has been happening in the last week. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3749.7799999999997s)]
*  So we have gone from a scenario in which gangs were fighting each other, and now we have a scenario in which gangs are allied together, fighting the state. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3752.7799999999997s)]
*  This has been obviously a message for Henry, who, as you noted, was out of the country and they were asking for his resignation. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3762.9399999999996s)]
*  But we very much think it was also a message for the Kenyans. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3771.2999999999997s)]
*  And they were saying, we are going to be a force to be reckoned with if you decide to come. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3775.2599999999998s)]
*  And so that is the situation where we are today with the gangs allied, ready to confront a multinational support mission if it is to arrive [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3781.86s)]
*  and searching to expand, to control at this point, almost they have the majority of the city and they could soon control 100 percent of Port-au-Prince [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3794.1400000000003s)]
*  and then likely expand to the rest of the country. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3806.78s)]
*  Okay, well that is quite clear. So essentially the Prime Minister, Prime Minister Henry, goes to Kenya to kind of finalize this mission. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3809.86s)]
*  And so the gangs make the move while he is out of the country to prevent that Kenya mission from coming in. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3816.7400000000002s)]
*  And they seem to have succeeded in doing that in the short term and also may have succeeded in preventing Prime Minister Henry from kind of resuming [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3821.9s)]
*  whatever governing authority he had, which is probably not much to begin with. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3831.78s)]
*  Before we get into kind of what the options are for dealing with this situation, I just want to ask from the reporting that your team has done, [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3835.58s)]
*  you know, when we look at this from the outside, we see kidnappings, we see, you know, people being killed. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3845.34s)]
*  Do you have any sense of what life is like for just ordinary people on the ground in Port-au-Prince in this circumstance? [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3851.62s)]
*  Yes, I mean, it has been very, very difficult until now, and it has just increasingly worsened in the last week. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3859.3399999999997s)]
*  So until, until let's say two weeks ago, what we had was very strong territorial control by the gangs. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3867.02s)]
*  So people would only be able to leave their neighborhood to go to work, for example, if they had permission from the gangs. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3873.7s)]
*  The gangs were also very interested in having people stay in the territories they controlled, you know, [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3880.2999999999997s)]
*  like even though there's hundreds of thousands of displaced people in Haiti at the moment, the gangs were trying to prevent that from happening. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3885.7s)]
*  So, for example, if a family has three people that work, only one person will be able to leave the neighborhood. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3893.06s)]
*  There was incredible amounts of sexual violence that being exerted. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3899.3799999999997s)]
*  Women were being forced to be sexual partners of the gangs. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3903.1s)]
*  And there was obviously a humanitarian situation in terms of access to food, to health services. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3907.8599999999997s)]
*  Schools have been closed for a very long time. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3913.74s)]
*  And with a crumbling state, essentially, no protection services were being offered. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3916.4599999999996s)]
*  That has only made it, been made worse in the last week because particularly access to gasoline is incredibly important in Haiti. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3921.8199999999997s)]
*  Most homes in Haiti don't have electricity and they depend on plants that are run by gasoline. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3932.66s)]
*  People have not been able to leave their houses to get gasoline. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3939.14s)]
*  So that means they don't have electricity. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3942.66s)]
*  And the majority of the people also have water plants because there's no potable water that comes into their houses. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3944.7799999999997s)]
*  And people are running out of food. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3950.94s)]
*  But when you leave the house, there's so much violence on the street that you really are risking your life. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3953.06s)]
*  So what we're seeing is that people have been inside and they're running out of food. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3958.58s)]
*  And for those people that have been hurt by the violence that is occurring on the streets, there's almost no health services. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3964.2599999999998s)]
*  The gangs have ransacked the biggest hospitals. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3971.14s)]
*  Doctors Without Borders and other international organizations have small clinics, but they are clearly overwhelmed. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3976.14s)]
*  Not to mention people that just have regular medical emergencies that need to be attended, women that are pregnant, et cetera, et cetera. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3982.14s)]
*  I mean, Haiti had already a humanitarian emergency in terms of food. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3989.14s)]
*  More than half of the country needed food assistance. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3993.02s)]
*  30 percent in what the World Food Program calls critical access. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=3995.9s)]
*  And that is just gone through the roof in the last week. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4000.46s)]
*  So it's really a nightmare scenario, what we have right now. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4004.98s)]
*  So, I mean, what you're describing sounds like both the definition of a failed state, essentially, [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4008.34s)]
*  with gangs having more power than any governing authority and a humanitarian catastrophe that could get worse [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4016.06s)]
*  as people lack food and water, potable water. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4023.38s)]
*  You know, even the proposals that are now on hold of having one to two thousand largely Kenyan police come in to support what is already a pretty small, [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4028.1400000000003s)]
*  I think under 10,000 active duty police in Haiti, it feels insufficient to deal with the scale of the challenge you described. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4039.06s)]
*  I mean, what what kind of recommendations has Crisis Group made and what do you think the international community should be thinking about in terms of options for dealing with the situation? [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4048.62s)]
*  Yes, the situation is very dire and the announcement from the Kenyans that they are going to put pause until there is a more clear governance structure in place in Haiti does make the situation very complicated. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4059.54s)]
*  I mean, for very understandable reasons, Haitians have been very reluctant to international forces coming into the country. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4074.38s)]
*  Right. There is a long history from colonial times to invasions by the US, but through the sort of checkered results of Minusat, etc. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4082.1000000000004s)]
*  that have left people with a very sour taste. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4093.3s)]
*  However, at this precise moment, because the situation is so dire, most of the Haitians that we have spoken to are very, very supportive of the idea of the mission. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4095.9s)]
*  And really what we are hearing from Haiti today is true panic at the sense that nobody is going to come and help. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4105.78s)]
*  Simultaneously, the US has made it very clear that they are not keen on sending troops, at least not at the moment. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4114.38s)]
*  I would imagine that if boatloads of Haitian migrants start arriving in Florida, that might change the calculation. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4122.26s)]
*  But at this point, it isn't. What we're hoping is that this governance structure that was proposed or that came out of the meeting in CARICOM yesterday sort of takes place quickly. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4129.860000000001s)]
*  And then the Kenyans feel that they do have a counterpart in Haiti that would be sufficient and that the Kenyans get some sort of support from other donor troops [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4142.46s)]
*  to contribute their countries and are able to land in the country. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4155.18s)]
*  I mean, obviously, the idea of an invasion by US security forces seems like not really a recommendable notion. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4160.14s)]
*  But the fact that the security situation is such as what we're seeing right now, it's a tremendous challenge for the Kenyans who are sending, let's remember, police and not military. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4168.34s)]
*  And so what it was supposed to be a mission that was going to go into the neighborhoods to gain control of roads, safeguarding state structures has now turned into something more complicated. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4182.54s)]
*  So it seems unlikely that they are going to be able to successfully do the work against the gangs unless they are accompanied by a more robust military force, even if just temporarily to allow them to to settle into the country. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4197.46s)]
*  Simultaneously, however, we do think it is very important to keep lines of communications with the gangs open. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4213.46s)]
*  And I think it is important to make a distinction here. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4220.78s)]
*  Right. Sherry Seah, who has become sort of the spokesperson for the gangs, does have political ambitions himself. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4224.22s)]
*  He has hoped to be part of government in the past, and I'm sure he would be hoping that they would be included in this new transitional government. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4232.900000000001s)]
*  That seems really farfetched. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4241.740000000001s)]
*  And I don't think neither the Haitians nor the international community would really be supportive of that idea. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4243.42s)]
*  However, there are multiple people in Haiti because the gangs have existed for so long, they have good channels of communication to them. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4250.34s)]
*  And we're talking about local people, members of the church, local leaders that have been negotiating humanitarian access in certain neighborhoods that have been helping with specific people, movement, etc. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4258.42s)]
*  Those channels of communication are vital at this moment to negotiate with the gangs some sort of violence reduction, [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4271.26s)]
*  particularly to protect the population, but also to eventually allow this new government to take shape. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4278.5s)]
*  Obviously, the gangs have the upper hand at this moment, and so it's going to be very difficult to convince them to step down. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4286.82s)]
*  But if they were to see a force that comes that looks strong enough that it will really give them a run for their money, I think there will be a bit of intimidation. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4294.58s)]
*  It's difficult to know because right now there's almost no counterpart for the gangs to know how strong they will be if they were faced with a well-trained force such as the one that Kenya has. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4306.38s)]
*  Benin has also offered troops, etc. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4320.54s)]
*  Right. It's a different calculation to see them now when they have the run of the place, vis-a-vis what would be the case if there was some serious security forces that would be facing them. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4322.9s)]
*  So what we're hoping is that there could be a two-pronged approach. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4335.9s)]
*  Clearly, a security intervention is at this point the only solution to at least bring the violence down a little bit. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4340.0199999999995s)]
*  But also, we're hoping that the local government and also hopefully the international community do keep these lines of communication open and try and convince the gang leadership that it is in their best interest to lower the violence, [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4348.18s)]
*  particularly against the communities. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4363.5s)]
*  So it sounds like what you're saying is there needs to be probably a bigger international force than even the Kenyan contingent in order to both try to stabilize things and maybe to create a basis for some negotiation with the gangs. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4366.46s)]
*  Right now, there's no reason for the gangs to negotiate if they have control. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4380.7s)]
*  Another part of this equation, as you mentioned, is the political structure in Haiti itself. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4384.58s)]
*  The US government had kind of supported the idea of a transition from Prime Minister Henri. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4391.58s)]
*  The US State Department urged a transition so as to facilitate a multinational security mission. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4399.98s)]
*  You mentioned CARICOM, the Caribbean countries meeting, to try to work through what a transition might look like. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4406.58s)]
*  If Prime Minister Henri seems like he's moving out of the picture here, what do you think the transition plan should be for Haiti's government? [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4413.66s)]
*  Is it even feasible? [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4425.3s)]
*  Because the US always ties these things to elections, but elections sometimes don't solve any problems. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4427.3s)]
*  They just kind of create another vehicle for unrest and instability. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4432.5s)]
*  How do you see the political situation that is required in Haiti going forward to make this work? [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4438.06s)]
*  I think what came out of the CARICOM meeting yesterday is promising and it's something that could work. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4444.3s)]
*  Understanding that Henri is out of the picture. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4452.860000000001s)]
*  It's sort of unfortunate that he has taken this long for Henri to accept to resign. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4455.46s)]
*  I think the main structure that was agreed yesterday in Jamaica is the main structure that has been discussed in political negotiations in Haiti for the last almost two years. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4460.86s)]
*  So this is not incredibly innovative. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4473.82s)]
*  And what it does, it sort of echoes the structures that are created by the Haitian constitution. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4476.299999999999s)]
*  So we're talking about what they're calling a presidential council, which will be for now a replacement of the president. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4482.58s)]
*  Right. We don't have a president. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4490.66s)]
*  So this presidential council will have seven people and those people will be representatives, both of the main political groups or the main political alliances, but also private sector and key social society groups such as the Montana Accord, [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4492.42s)]
*  which has been kind of the leading voice of the opposition coming from civil society. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4512.42s)]
*  So that would be one part of the government. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4518.54s)]
*  And then once that presidential council is formed, they will come together and appoint a prime minister and that prime minister will appoint its cabinet. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4520.42s)]
*  And so that sort of presidential council, prime minister and cabinet would be the transitional government. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4531.46s)]
*  I think that calling for elections at this point would be completely insane. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4541.54s)]
*  There hasn't been electoral authorities in Haiti for a long time. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4545.74s)]
*  From the technical perspective, it would be almost impossible to know where people are so that they could come to the voting polls. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4550.26s)]
*  And we have seen in the past how poorly prepared elections have actually not helped. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4558.06s)]
*  They've been very detrimental for the stability of Haiti. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4564.66s)]
*  So running into an election of that sort would be a mistake. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4567.62s)]
*  However, we do have a transitional government that represents the majority. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4573.06s)]
*  It's never going to represent every single Haitian, right? [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4579.1s)]
*  But if it does represent the majority of the political and social forces of Haiti and it can work together to bring the mission and to work with foreign partners to try and address the security and humanitarian [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4581.9800000000005s)]
*  situation, then at least that will be a start. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4597.18s)]
*  It's not going to be easy. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4600.74s)]
*  Haitians have been fighting on the small, you know, where the details of what these governments should look like for a long time. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4602.22s)]
*  CARICOM had asked them to bring forward a proposal and they couldn't get together. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4611.14s)]
*  They couldn't agree on one. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4617.1s)]
*  So they ended up sending seven proposals to CARICOM. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4618.34s)]
*  And it was only yesterday when Jamaica, everybody locked the doors, called people on Zoom and was like, we have to come up with one agreement and that's it. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4622.34s)]
*  And nobody leaves until we do that. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4631.900000000001s)]
*  It is too bad that it had to become such a terrible crisis before everybody came to the table with the willingness to make these kinds of compromises. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4634.02s)]
*  But hopefully now there is an understanding of what would be a terrible risk if these governments doesn't work and that it's really the only way forward for Haiti to be able to start addressing the other two terrible [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4646.179999999999s)]
*  crisis that it has. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4660.86s)]
*  So we're hopeful that within the next day or two, we should have the names of who are these people that are going to be part of the presidential council and soon thereafter the name of the new prime minister. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4662.419999999999s)]
*  So last question. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4674.94s)]
*  I mean, part of what you're describing, what's interesting here is you have lots of different countries playing a role here. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4675.94s)]
*  You've got CARICOM, the Caribbean neighbors of Haiti. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4680.9s)]
*  You've got Kenya and Benin potentially providing these troops or police. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4683.66s)]
*  You obviously have the Haitians themselves. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4689.22s)]
*  In terms of the U.S., which is now drawing down part of our embassy, has this very complicated and often bad history of intervention in Haitian politics, but has more resources than anybody else in the hemisphere. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4691.7s)]
*  The world, really. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4704.5s)]
*  What do you recommend the U.S. policy be going forward? [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4705.820000000001s)]
*  Where can the U.S. try to help in this circumstance? [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4708.860000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think obviously speeding the support to the multinational support mission is going to be crucially important. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4712.26s)]
*  We know that's not the government's prerogative exclusively. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4720.26s)]
*  And some of this money has been stuck in Congress and it hasn't been approved. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4724.42s)]
*  So that is problematic. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4728.7s)]
*  But really trying to solve that issue and find ways to bring the key equipment that the Kenyans need and the support, be it in kind or in cash, is hugely relevant. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4730.18s)]
*  I think the U.S. also has been until now. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4745.3s)]
*  I think for the U.S. and they're not the only actor. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4750.3s)]
*  They're used to only working with their institutional counterparts, right? [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4755.18s)]
*  And they were very attached to Henry as a counterpart because it made sense, right? [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4759.18s)]
*  He had been appointed with kind of iffy process, but a little bit of legitimacy. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4764.700000000001s)]
*  But there needs to be an understanding that the social forces in Haiti go beyond the institutions and that with such a stating crumbles, there needs to be consultation that is very wide and open. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4769.860000000001s)]
*  And that's something that hadn't happened for the international community was very reluctant to engage with civil society in Haiti for a very long time, honestly, for way too long. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4781.94s)]
*  And that was part of what dragged this political crisis that long. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4792.42s)]
*  So I think from now on, understanding that what's happening in Haiti is very different than what's happening in other parts of the world and that there needs to be an engagement with social forces, too, will be key. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4796.46s)]
*  But I think there is one thing that has been incredibly important and that we've been honing on this for a long time, but nothing has happened is that a lot of the weapons that are being used by the Haitian gangs come from the United States and they come mostly from Florida. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4808.1s)]
*  They are purchased in the States and then they are hidden in the cargo that takes other products into Haiti. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4828.06s)]
*  And this is a relatively easy problem to solve. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4836.38s)]
*  It's one that for some reason, well, for a political reason that I think we can only imagine what is the political reason behind the reluctance to get involved in that. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4840.3s)]
*  There's been very little action on the parts of the state. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4850.66s)]
*  But at this point, if the gangs are not receiving new weapons, if they're not receiving particularly more ammunition, the equation on the ground would change dramatically. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4854.66s)]
*  And this is something that it would not be very costly and it would be actually fairly feasible for the United States to do right away. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4865.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4872.9400000000005s)]
*  I think experts have identified out of what ports these guns are leaving Florida. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4873.9800000000005s)]
*  And so that should be really straightforward. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4880.06s)]
*  And we're hoping that the stromentous crisis is what finally pushes the American government to do that. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4882.54s)]
*  Well, in a sane world, we would not have guns, weapons of war for sale across the United States. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4888.46s)]
*  But in a world where we do, the least we could do is try to stop those weapons from moving to Haiti. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4897.740000000001s)]
*  Look, thank you so much for giving us so much information. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4902.900000000001s)]
*  We really appreciate it. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4906.06s)]
*  And hopefully people will listen to the recommendations coming from Crisis Group on this. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4907.18s)]
*  So again, thanks for your work and we'll keep in touch on this. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4914.58s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4918.18s)]
*  Thanks again to Renata Segura for joining the show. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4919.66s)]
*  And Aaron Rodgers, man, I don't know. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4922.3s)]
*  Might be a better VP than the quarterback these days. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4925.62s)]
*  Yeah, we might need a kill notification on that one. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4928.5s)]
*  I can't believe they called it a kill notification. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4931.34s)]
*  I kept reading that story. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4932.9400000000005s)]
*  It's really jarring. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4934.3s)]
*  It's just a Photoshop. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4936.62s)]
*  Just not printing the photo because they have weird fingers. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4937.5s)]
*  Weird sausage hands. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4940.26s)]
*  Anyway, that's it for us. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4942.62s)]
*  Talk to you guys next week. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgypRk7y7-I&t=4944.1s)]
