# BREAKING: Putin Kills Alexei Navalny in Russian Prison
**Pod Save the World:** [February 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc)
*  Welcome to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Ben Rhodes and we are doing a special edition of Pod Save the World for very horrible reasons [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=0.0s)]
*  The Russian opposition leader and anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny has been announced dead at the age of 47 [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=8.44s)]
*  So very very terrible Ben who folks on YouTube will see is actually calling in from the Munich Security Conference [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  The the beating heart of the blob Ben. How's it going out there? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=21.580000000000002s)]
*  Yeah [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=24.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's a I saw like 900 people that you know Tommy [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=27.12s)]
*  But like let's say it's a jam-packed event here, but I will say like in a somber thing [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=32.2s)]
*  I mean Julia Navalny is here as wife and so [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=37.32s)]
*  And actually for people who listen to another Russia's John and I'm sova whose father Boris Nemtsov was also assassinated by [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=42.04s)]
*  Vladimir Putin she's here as well [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  And and so, you know that kind of added this [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=51.720000000000006s)]
*  Poignancy to a conference otherwise it was a lot of people being like anxious about, you know [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=55.6s)]
*  Ukraine funding and American politics like it it just kind of drove home that these are really big stakes in the world [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=59.72s)]
*  Yeah, well said I mean, yeah, we'll listen to a clip of Julia Navalny later [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  And and I do think I mean the fact that this you know, there's debates happening in Congress over Ukraine funding [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=69.72s)]
*  There's the Munich Security Conference happening right now. It just makes the hold the timing of this so [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=74.52000000000001s)]
*  Weird and poignant and we'll get into that as well [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=79.92s)]
*  But I mean just the facts at the top here [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=83.89999999999999s)]
*  So Alexei Navalny died while serving at a combined 30 year prison sentence [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=85.92s)]
*  Most recently he was at a penal colony in the Arctic Circle [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=90.98s)]
*  That's how far away from you know, Moscow Putin needed to send him the Russian federal penitentiary service announced his death in a statement on Friday [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=93.94s)]
*  Basically, they said he he fell it felt unwell after a walk [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=101.64s)]
*  Apparently Russian state media is now saying it was a blood clot [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=106.52s)]
*  We are obviously skeptical of any explanations about his death given the history there [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=109.56s)]
*  Peskov Putin spokesman says Putin was informed [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=115.24s)]
*  So Navalny's team says they don't have any confirmation about his death and the money's lawyer is traveling [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  To this penal colony in the Arctic Circle [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=124.08s)]
*  But Russian media says Alexei Navalny's mother said he looked happy and healthy when she saw him on Monday [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=127.28s)]
*  Navalny addressed a Russian court via video conference on Thursday. He looked fine. He was cracking jokes [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=133.96s)]
*  So this is all incredibly suspicious [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=140.32s)]
*  We do know Ben that his [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=142.52s)]
*  Terms of his confinement were awful [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=144.72s)]
*  I mean I heard an interview with Navalny's daughter [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=146.56s)]
*  Last year where she said her dad was spending most of his time in solitary confinement [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=148.92s)]
*  This guy was six foot three and his cell was seven feet by eight feet [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=153.48s)]
*  He was allowed like one mug one toothbrush in one book [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=157.2s)]
*  So horrible circumstances [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=160.72s)]
*  But we'll get into more about sort of who Navalny is like his background in his biography [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=162.76s)]
*  But I just want to throw it to you Ben because you know [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=167.56s)]

*  Relationship and also what else folks need to know about him. Yeah, well, I mean [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=180.48s)]
*  first of all, we should just say that [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  We won't necessarily ever know the exact circumstance but Vladimir Putin killed Alexei Navalny [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=187.44s)]
*  you know, and whether he kills him by [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=192.32000000000002s)]

*  He's poisoned him before and the confinement either way Vladimir Putin killed Alexei Navalny and that's that's full stop [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=198.76000000000002s)]

*  Americans think we know how to like promote democracy and that ends up pregnant creating problems for people like Alexei Navalny [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=242.52s)]

*  And he was able to hold on to it in the darkest of circumstances like literally like video conferencing [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=288.88s)]
*  Knowing her to spend 30 years of your life in a penal colony if you didn't die first [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=294.16s)]
*  He's like cracking jokes [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=297.84s)]
*  Into as he's zooming into a courtroom [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=300.76s)]
*  It was like an amazing part of his personality that he was able to you know, keep that up throughout [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=302.76s)]
*  You know all that happened to him. It was you know, it's exactly right [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=307.4s)]

*  I think that is a Russian thing [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=315.0s)]
*  And then the other personal thing I'd say, you know [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=317.0s)]
*  He said to me, you know [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=322.32s)]
*  I got to the point of like, you know [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=324.0s)]
*  You go through someone's journey and how do they get into politics and his story is pretty interesting anti-corruption activists [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=325.68s)]
*  Turn blogger essentially turned investigative journalists exposing all this corruption [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=331.76s)]
*  but then he gets into politics and I [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=336.36s)]
*  Never really wanted to ask these questions about what's it like to be in prison and and you feel almost salacious [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=338.96s)]
*  You know, like what's are you scared when you go to jail kind of stuff? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=343.84s)]
*  and what if he kills you, you know, like because these questions lurking backdrop and [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=346.76s)]
*  He said to me, you know [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=351.36s)]
*  of course [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=354.32s)]
*  You're afraid when you're in prison and I'll never he said like when the prison door clangs shut [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=356.36s)]
*  You know, they can do anything to you [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=361.8s)]
*  And this is really Russia's, you know, like ominous and and when he'd said that to me, he'd already been poisoned in prison once [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=364.8s)]
*  and [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=372.04s)]
*  And he said the things that sustained him [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=373.72s)]
*  And the reason he kept coming back at it is [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=376.8s)]
*  Is number one he had the support of his family and he was very clear [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=379.84s)]
*  He's like if my wife Julia didn't support this I wouldn't do it [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=383.71999999999997s)]
*  This is something we do together [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=387.04s)]
*  And and he's like I don't feel alone in prison because I feel like she's there with me because I know she supports [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=388.52s)]
*  My decision to be doing this which I always said was an interesting window into like, you know [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=393.56s)]
*  Activists not their families sacrifice for them. They have two children [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=399.44s)]
*  One with the also great. Yeah, when is it Sanford Dasha? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=403.76s)]
*  but [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=408.32s)]
*  But also that that's what he's thinking about in prison [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=409.6s)]
*  Like, you know, I take comfort in that and and you'll notice if you you know when he was in prison [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=411.6s)]
*  He would often his messages were to his wife [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=415.8s)]
*  But then the other thing he said is what sustained him is rage and he said if I ever need an incentive to be in prison [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=418.72s)]
*  I'll just think about what it's like to be in a Russian court and the lies that they tell you or I'll think about [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=423.6s)]
*  You know the buildings that were knocked down in Moscow by a bunch of gangsters like stealing money from people when he got into politics [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=428.28s)]
*  Or I'll think about the lies that Putin tells why still, you know rage this weird mixture of rage humor and family [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=435.04s)]
*  Well, you feel like like that's that's the Alexei Navalny that I met and it was this kind of very interesting character [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=443.16s)]
*  And he had this way to cut through bullshit [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=449.76s)]
*  He's like, you know, you know the couple things that I always remember like the thing that stands out to me [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=452.16s)]
*  He said, you know Putin doesn't need to convince everybody that he's not a liar or that he's not corrupt [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=458.12s)]
*  He just sets convinced people that everybody is, you know [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=463.96s)]
*  Like try and he said and yeah, and he said well, he said the same thing is true about global politics [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=466.96s)]
*  He's like he has to just convince people that [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=471.52s)]
*  Democracy is just as corrupt as the system in Russia [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=474.79999999999995s)]
*  I remember him saying to me and look what had happened when Donald Trump gets elected [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=477.52s)]
*  My whole he said in my whole life [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=481.84s)]
*  I've been making an argument that in a democracy that better people rise to the top than our system and then all of a sudden [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=483.24s)]
*  You guys elect someone [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=488.52s)]
*  Totally correct and he was like joking about it, you know [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=489.96s)]
*  But like yeah, this kind of in like the way to cut through the bullshit in his analysis of Russian politics [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=492.64s)]
*  Again, last thing and I'll shut up. I remember him saying to me [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=497.71999999999997s)]
*  Like I said, what would happen if you could run and he said the first time I run for president if they really let me [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=500.52s)]
*  I'd lose the second time I'd win like he was sure he could win that he could be president of Russia [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=505.47999999999996s)]
*  Like he was certain of it. There was this kind of fearlessness and certainty of it [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=510.96s)]
*  And again, I think that's what scared Putin, you know, like that this guy was not afraid of him [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=515.04s)]
*  He's fucking fearless unlike Putin who's like a you know pussy who like hides in the Kremlin orders these things and and [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=520.0s)]
*  steals money from people and and and [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=528.24s)]
*  you know [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=530.44s)]
*  It's just a tragedy like that that someone like that is is lost for having guts, you know, you know, you know [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=533.4s)]
*  But he knew what he was doing when he flew back to Russia after they almost killed him last time [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=540.8s)]
*  Yeah, I mean so just a little more of his backstory. I think normally got into politics around 2008 [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=544.52s)]
*  He became very well known internationally around the 2011 anti-government anti-Putin protests [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=548.4s)]
*  And then he did attempt to run for president in 2018 [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=554.28s)]
*  But to your point Putin was so scared of him that he barred him for doing so based on some trumped up corruption charges from [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=556.92s)]
*  several years earlier [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=563.56s)]
*  Navalny was you're right. I mean he was a an activist [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=565.1999999999999s)]
*  He was an opposition candidate, but he was also an incredibly powerful [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=568.04s)]
*  Messenger and propagandist really and I say that as in the most complimentary way [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=572.24s)]
*  His organization would make these these YouTube videos about the lavish lifestyles of Putin or Dmitri medvedev like Putin's inner circle [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=576.12s)]
*  In the way, they were living and literally in Putin's case a billion dollar home paid for by corruption [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=584.2800000000001s)]
*  I think the video about Putin's billion dollar palace in the Black Sea has over 120 million views at this point [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=590.0200000000001s)]
*  so you can tell why Putin saw him as a threat and you know to your point that he was poisoned in prison and [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=596.12s)]
*  Then he was poisoned again in [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=600.5200000000001s)]
*  2020 by some FSB agents who followed him on a business trip to Siberia [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=603.32s)]
*  poisoned his underwear and miraculously [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=610.0s)]
*  Navalny survived that got treatment in Germany and then came back to Russia knowing full well [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=612.76s)]
*  he'd be arrested and thrown in jail like this and [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=617.6800000000001s)]
*  In the process he was so smart that he worked with this organization Bellingcat [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=620.4s)]
*  Which figured out which FSB unit was the one who tried to assassinate him? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=625.0400000000001s)]
*  He called one of the guys who was part of the assassination team pretended to be his boss's boss's boss and got him to [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=629.36s)]
*  You know detail to Navalny all the ways this assassination team tried to kill him try to cover it up, etc [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=637.24s)]
*  Etc. So just like an unbelievably savvy [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=643.5600000000001s)]
*  Creative guy and to your point then like the kind of like wry humor at all was the through line through everything he did [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=646.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean there's a there was a cleverness right like he [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=653.0400000000001s)]
*  He told me the story of like how he rose from being this kind of local political operative to being this blogger and [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=657.24s)]
*  He had a law degree had a legal background and what he did is he bought [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=664.24s)]
*  a really small number of shares in [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=669.3199999999999s)]
*  Like all the big Russian oil companies [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=672.68s)]
*  And this is a little bit a while ago when there's a little bit more of a legal [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=675.6s)]
*  And he used that to sue all them to reveal [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=680.28s)]
*  Like their schemes, you know, and and and so he realized that there was this tool he could use to show that they were [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=684.72s)]
*  The the profits they were making [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=691.76s)]
*  You know didn't match up, you know, but basically he was revealing that they were [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=694.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, they're billions of dollars disappearing middlemen [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=700.16s)]
*  and I tell it to her cuz like [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=702.92s)]
*  He there was just he was always kind of one step ahead in being clever about finding a weakness in [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=704.32s)]
*  The regime and it was always about corruption [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=710.76s)]
*  It's always about exposing corruption and he was sometimes criticized for being a single-issue guy just focused on corruption [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=713.24s)]
*  But you know what he would always say is well, the whole thing is corrupt [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=719.28s)]
*  So if we don't get rid of this corrupt system, we can't solve the other problems [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=723.24s)]
*  Like I I'd love to have an agenda about like health care and you know foreign policy [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=727.16s)]
*  But before that we had to get rid of these corrupt kleptocrats essentially, you know [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=731.76s)]
*  And and again that that built this following that he had across Russia and it should be clear like I [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=736.24s)]
*  I've admired Boris Nemtsov for instance the politician I mentioned who was assassinated [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=742.44s)]
*  Navalny was not like a [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=746.5600000000001s)]
*  Western liberal like, you know, he wasn't one of these [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=748.64s)]
*  Russian opposition guys that hangs out a lot in Washington and in that and I admire those guys by the way [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=751.5600000000001s)]
*  I did I don't mean they mean them but he was like a pretty hard-ass guy from a military town outside of Moscow [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=756.0s)]
*  He associated with some Russian nationalists, which will probably talk about [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=762.12s)]
*  But he also he reached [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=766.84s)]
*  Different audiences. It wasn't like he was just reaching [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=770.08s)]
*  Yes, sure [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=773.0s)]
*  Some of it was kind of like these middle-class Muscovites who turned up to protest when Putin came back in office and Navalny led that [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=773.72s)]
*  protest movement [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=779.1600000000001s)]
*  But you know, he could also reach into other parts of Russia and he traveled all across the country [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=780.6s)]
*  Like when he was poisoned he was in Siberia, you know [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=785.32s)]
*  and so this combination of of innovation and and humor and [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=788.8000000000001s)]
*  And also just kind of being you know, a pretty authentic Russian guy with a very authentic Russian family [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=794.4s)]
*  Again that all contributed to the kind of potency of his is his standing [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=801.4s)]
*  Yeah [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=805.64s)]
*  I mean I think that nationalism was part of his appeal part of his ability to reach beyond as he said kind of like elite [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=805.9599999999999s)]
*  Educated circles in Moscow and to sort of like appeal to the common man [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=811.7199999999999s)]
*  To your point about his divisiveness in some circles [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=817.16s)]
*  I mean, I think he was seen as a divisive figure among some of the more liberal opposition in Russia [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=820.0799999999999s)]
*  Because they thought he was more of an attention getter than a politician like you said earlier [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=825.88s)]
*  I mean even if I'm only admitted he didn't really have policy proposals [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=830.0799999999999s)]
*  He did these, you know [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=833.0799999999999s)]
*  Anti-corruption YouTube videos that garnered lots of attention and sort of went after Putin [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=834.12s)]
*  But that was what he saw as his path to taking down this corrupt regime [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=837.92s)]
*  There was also some controversy around Navalny in 2021 [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=842.0799999999999s)]
*  MBC International [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=846.72s)]
*  briefly revoked Navalny's a prisoner of conscience status after some of his old comments resurfaced including a time when he compared [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=848.44s)]
*  Immigrants to cockroaches. Obviously, that's like a totally inappropriate dehumanizing thing to say [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=855.92s)]
*  but you know, I think it did sort of speak to the kind of person that Putin saw as a threat and who could appeal politically to [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=860.76s)]
*  Putin voters for a lack of a better word. Yeah, you know he [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=869.52s)]
*  He you know, he's been asked about this a lot and actually people should watch the documentary Navalny and he's asked about this there [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=873.52s)]
*  And he gives like a pretty clear answer [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=879.0s)]
*  some of that stuff he's apologized for like he ended up apologizing for and you know [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=881.2399999999999s)]
*  I think he like was a bit more of like a you know, some of the rough edges may have been smooth over but [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=884.76s)]
*  He defended some of his association with these kind of ultra nationalist dudes and [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=890.8399999999999s)]
*  And he makes this point in the documentary and people can judge for themselves [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=896.4399999999999s)]
*  He's like I'm trying to like get rid of this autocrat like I anybody that's against Putin, you know [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=899.4000000000001s)]
*  And and and we can debate that but put yourself in his shoes [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=904.12s)]
*  You know, like by and large like the people around Navalny were more liberal, you know [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=908.44s)]
*  folks who [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=914.2800000000001s)]
*  Wanted to have democratic values. I think that you know, if you mean my consciousness of all me [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=915.96s)]
*  He just basically talked about you know, Putin represents not just corruption [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=921.48s)]
*  You know Putin represents not just corruption but also this kind of russian czar mindset where we spend money on wars and [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=925.24s)]
*  Instead of spending his message to me. Tommy was basically like let's stop spending message on wars overseas and start investing money in russia [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=932.2s)]
*  You know, let's stop like and giving my john carrey 2004. Yeah, it's a it's a pretty classic like populist message [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=938.6800000000001s)]
*  Like democratic principles bring the money home [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=946.12s)]
*  I don't think he was like some uber nationals [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=949.48s)]
*  Even on ukraine and I write about this a lot in the book like [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=951.88s)]
*  You know was he he supported the annexation of Crimea? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=955.48s)]
*  Now what he explained to me his family was half ukrainian half russian, right? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=960.12s)]
*  one of his parents is russian one of his parents is ukrainian and he said they used to fight about this all the time and [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=963.8000000000001s)]
*  You know his version was like we should leave ukraine the hell alone [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=969.32s)]
*  But give us Crimea, you know [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=973.8000000000001s)]
*  Now I want to be clear about one thing though on this [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=975.8000000000001s)]
*  He would not have annexed Crimea though, you know, he would not have invaded Crimea he would not have invaded [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=978.36s)]
*  This you know, these are positions he took after the war started [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=983.96s)]
*  And he was an anti-war like he in prison when he could get him killed. He was protesting the war [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=987.72s)]
*  He in his whole message to me was what a waste war is and we shouldn't be doing it [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=994.6s)]
*  Um, so I think that we shouldn't whitewash the nationalism, but that doesn't make him Putin [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=998.44s)]
*  I know some people like oh, what's the difference in context? There's a massive difference [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1003.96s)]
*  This guy would not have invaded ukraine. This guy would not be killing people like him in russia [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1008.84s)]
*  This guy would not be like stealing hundreds of billions of dollars and giving it to people with yachts, you know, like [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1014.68s)]
*  and so I think that's [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1021.32s)]
*  that's the kind of you know [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1023.32s)]
*  you can't avoid, you know some of the [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1025.88s)]
*  The the nationalism in his background and the associations [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1029.72s)]
*  But you also have to see it in the context of russia and i'd put this to people [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1032.84s)]
*  Russia's not going away [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1037.08s)]
*  It's a huge important country. Would you rather have like a guy like alexei navalny running place or vladimir? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1038.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean look we're trying to build a coalition over here from like bill crystal to bernie sanders [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1043.4s)]
*  So we we have a we have a piece of that coming from our own house here [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1046.68s)]
*  So then you mentioned that uh, julia navalny alexi navalny's wife [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1049.8799999999999s)]
*  Was at the munich security conference when she heard the news. She actually addressed the group on the main stage [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1054.04s)]
*  Here's a clip if this is true [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1060.36s)]
*  I would like that putin and all his coterie [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1062.36s)]
*  Putin's friends [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1071.08s)]
*  his government [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1072.9199999999998s)]
*  to know that they [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1074.36s)]
*  Will be accountable for what they've done to our country [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1076.9199999999998s)]
*  to my family [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1081.24s)]
*  and to my [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1083.4799999999998s)]
*  Husband they will be liable for that [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1085.32s)]
*  That day will come very soon [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1088.04s)]
*  I would like to call upon the global community everyone in this room [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1091.0s)]
*  People around the world [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1098.44s)]
*  So that we would unite together and overcome that evil [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1100.76s)]
*  overcome the [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1106.5s)]
*  terrible regime [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1108.52s)]
*  That is currently in russia. We should just say ben that you know when when vladimir putin [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1110.6s)]
*  Uh had his fsb guys [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1114.92s)]
*  Try to assassinate navalny in 2020. He was asked about it. It's like yearly press conference and he didn't he said yes, basically he [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1117.3200000000002s)]
*  Admitted that the fsb had been tailing navalny [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1125.16s)]
*  But basically his response was like look if we wanted to kill them, they would have finished the job [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1127.72s)]
*  So, you know, he is uh, this behavior has been approached with complete impunity by putin [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1131.16s)]
*  We'll get into this more with the biden press conference clips later, but i'm sure there will be efforts by [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1136.76s)]
*  You know western countries to punish putin and punish russia for this act [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1142.52s)]
*  But you know biden gets into this a bit [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1146.44s)]
*  I mean a lot of those steps have already been taken in terms of sanctions, etc [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1147.96s)]
*  yeah, you know, it's just like I don't know I got a little emotional hearing that because it's just [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1151.24s)]
*  You know you have to [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1157.0s)]
*  You're right like this is like we're not gonna like sanction putin, you know, like the surrender over the navalny thing [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1159.56s)]
*  um [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1166.3600000000001s)]
*  and [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1167.72s)]
*  You know, we're not going to go to war with russia over this right and so at the end of the day [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1169.32s)]
*  And even the war in ukraine like we talked about is is you know, there's a stalemate there [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1173.88s)]
*  But the question that she raises about accountability, right? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1177.96s)]
*  Is a historical question, you know, it's basically like [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1182.6s)]
*  you know [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1185.8s)]
*  10 years from now putin [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1187.0s)]
*  Or 20 years from now vladimir putin could die in his bed president of russia richest man in the world, right? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1188.84s)]
*  or [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1194.52s)]
*  Like one way or another he will have been like hoisted out of there [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1195.72s)]
*  And it will be in disgrace, you know [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1199.72s)]
*  That's the real accountability. It's not some sanction we put on, you know [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1202.6000000000001s)]
*  And I think the basic message from the navalny family [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1206.1200000000001s)]
*  is like if more people had the guts of alexei navalny [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1209.4s)]
*  like [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1212.76s)]
*  In every dimension we don't all have to end up in a siberian prison [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1214.2s)]
*  I'm not suggesting we all go to siberia and get thrown in prison and and killed [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1216.68s)]
*  But this guy like the example of him flying back to russia after he was poisoned [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1221.0s)]
*  It's astounding knowing he'd get arrested when he landed there and knowing he'd probably get killed in prison after suffering a lot [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1225.24s)]
*  like think about the kind of asks that we make of ourselves, you know, like can you [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1231.4s)]
*  Volunteer for a campaign or something [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1236.2s)]
*  You know [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1238.6000000000001s)]
*  like like I like it's just like if if a few more people or like, you know some fucking republicans who [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1239.8s)]
*  Are afraid to like break with trump on [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1246.76s)]
*  ukraine supplemental because they don't get like fucking true socialed at them or [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1249.0800000000002s)]
*  you know [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1254.8400000000001s)]
*  Or some russians by the way, like a bunch of russian oligarchs who yeah like don't want to give up their yachts [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1256.92s)]
*  Um, so they don't cross putin like well this guy gave up his life. Okay, uh roman abramovic like [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1262.52s)]
*  so [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1269.8000000000002s)]
*  That's the lesson for me from all this is like if you want to step way way back [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1271.4s)]
*  This guy was willing to die [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1275.16s)]
*  for his belief that [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1277.4s)]
*  blarber putin is like a kleptocratic [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1279.16s)]
*  Criminal who is like ruining his country [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1282.28s)]
*  And we can all do a little bit better and if we do it's more likely that [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1284.92s)]
*  In the whole not just in the war in ukraine, but in the kind of whole contest that is happening [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1289.3999999999999s)]
*  It's more likely than not that that he will not die in his bed [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1294.12s)]
*  The richest man in the world in the ruler of russia, you know [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1298.36s)]
*  So then I think you know, it just listeners should know that the space for [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1300.68s)]
*  Uh journalism and opposition leaders and critics of putin was very small before the invasion of ukraine and now it's you know [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1304.52s)]
*  Completely shrunk if not gone [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1312.44s)]
*  It is worth also pointing out that putin was scared of navali. I mean he wouldn't even use his name [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1315.08s)]
*  but now putin has [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1320.2s)]
*  Thrown in jail or killed or forced into exile basically every prominent russian opposition leader [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1322.2s)]
*  He's actually targeting navali's team as well [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1328.68s)]
*  They labeled his organization extremist organization. They've been cracking down on navali's defense attorneys [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1331.56s)]
*  Um, you know you went through some of this earlier, but you know boris demsov was murdered in 2015 [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1337.6399999999999s)]
*  Uh the former oligarch mikhail khodorkovsky has been funding opposition leaders, but he's doing it from exile [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1342.52s)]
*  So, you know like there is just the question of kind of what comes next and who could take the up the mantle of an alexandrov [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1348.6s)]
*  Alny, uh is a very hard one because there's there's not any obvious answer at the moment [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1354.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and i'm going to be clear like I I actually don't put it on like, you know some [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1358.6s)]
*  20 year old russian [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1363.72s)]
*  To when I say people need to do more and be better like I I I get why like some young russian [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1365.8s)]
*  Isn't like rushing into the street to just get arrested and thrown in prison [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1371.8s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that there's not things that can be done within russian society [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1374.44s)]
*  And that doesn't mean that there aren't things that can be done like these russian elites who've you know made they made a deal with [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1378.04s)]
*  Like putin like the republicans made with trump like, you know 20 years ago [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1383.4s)]
*  They made that deal and some of those people have resources and they could be doing things [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1387.16s)]
*  I think the russian diaspora that has left like can can stay politically active [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1390.84s)]
*  I think by the way that you know, not that again be very clear [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1395.72s)]
*  These are not us the nevani movement is very much a russian movement [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1398.76s)]
*  So we had to be careful not to turn into some western back movement, but we can support them [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1401.88s)]
*  We can you know, they i'll give you one example tommy like they were setting up their whole youtube channels and their whole kind of [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1407.08s)]
*  capacity to broadcast [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1413.16s)]
*  Um when they were exiled and they were having trouble getting on american tech platforms because of sanctions, you know [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1414.84s)]
*  And well we can find a solution to that like the government can sit down with the tech companies like these are the kind there are [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1421.6399999999999s)]
*  Things that can be done [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1426.76s)]
*  To make it easier for russian opposition by both by russians and by outsiders [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1428.36s)]
*  But there's not another leader of his stature. There's not like, you know nemtsov [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1433.8s)]
*  was a a popular leader not as popular even as nevani by the end because for a lot of reasons and you know, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1437.8799999999999s)]
*  which we go into in another rush of the podcast that I did but like [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1444.1999999999998s)]
*  Um [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1447.5600000000002s)]
*  Was janah his daughter but the nevani was like a big [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1449.0800000000002s)]
*  You know the biggest figure by far in the russian opposition [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1454.0400000000002s)]
*  But I don't know. I think [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1457.4s)]
*  He knew what he's doing and I think he knew that like if he was killed if he survived [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1459.5600000000002s)]
*  Then he could become president and if he didn't [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1464.8400000000001s)]
*  I think he probably knew that that would like instill in a lot of russians a sense of like this is fucked [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1467.3200000000002s)]
*  I mean his martyrdom. I mean, it's an incredibly powerful thing [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1471.48s)]
*  And when the moment comes and it's common russia man it came in 1905 it came in 1917 [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1474.3600000000001s)]
*  like when the moment comes people [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1480.76s)]
*  Will be fucking pissed because of what he did alexander molony and there'll be somebody else who was inspired by him [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1483.72s)]
*  Who'd become that leader, you know? [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1489.0s)]
*  And meanwhile, he's got an infrastructure that can keep working on this and and I think you know [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1490.68s)]
*  So it's less like having one person to be the focal point and more just like what he represents won't die with him [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1494.28s)]
*  Yeah, well said. Um, so president biden, uh came out pretty [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1500.1200000000001s)]
*  Quickly to give a statement about alexander molony and he took some questions from press. Let's hear an excerpt [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1503.72s)]
*  Reports of his death if they're true and I have no reason to believe they're not [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1509.48s)]
*  Russian authorities are going to tell their own story but make no mistake [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1513.48s)]
*  Make no mistake putin is responsible for navalny's death putin is responsible [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1517.8s)]
*  What has happened in avalny is yet more proof of prudence brutality? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1524.44s)]
*  No one should be fooled not in russia not at home not anywhere in the world [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1529.64s)]
*  Putin does not only target his citizens of other countries [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1533.96s)]
*  As we've seen what's going on in ukraine right now. He also inflicts terrible crimes on his own people [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1538.1200000000001s)]
*  As people across russia and around the world are mourning navalny today [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1543.96s)]
*  Because he was so many things that putin was not [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1548.1200000000001s)]
*  He was brave [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1551.96s)]
*  He was principled. He was dedicated to building a russia where the rule of law existed [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1553.56s)]
*  And where it applied to everybody [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1559.72s)]
*  Navalny believed in that russia that russia [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1561.96s)]
*  He knew it was the cause worth fighting for [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1566.1200000000001s)]
*  And obviously even dying for [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1569.32s)]
*  This tragedy reminds us of the stakes of this moment, you know bet [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1571.64s)]
*  I know you haven't had time to watch the whole thing x here in munich, but it's a very strong statement from biden [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1574.92s)]
*  I mean clearly something an issue he knows about and is passionate about and someone he's probably spent time with [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1579.48s)]
*  Biden was also asked directly if the united states views this as an assassination sir first was this an assassination? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1584.6000000000001s)]
*  The answer is that we don't know exactly what happened, but there is no doubt [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1592.68s)]
*  That the death of navalny was the consequence of something that putin and his and his thugs did [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1598.28s)]
*  And to be clear you warned vladimir putin [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1605.08s)]
*  When you were in geneva of devastating consequences if navalny died in russian custody [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1608.28s)]
*  What consequences should he and russia face? That was three years ago in the meantime [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1614.2s)]
*  They faced a hell of a lot of consequences. They've lost and or had wounded over 350 000 russian soldiers [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1619.08s)]
*  They've made them a position where they've been subjected to great sanctions across the board [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1626.4399999999998s)]
*  And we're contemplating what else could be done. But what we're talking about at the time there were no [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1631.6399999999999s)]
*  Actions being taken against russia [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1637.32s)]
*  And that's look all this transpired since then so ben, I mean, I I you know, I thought it was a strong statement [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1639.72s)]
*  i'm glad biden came out and [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1645.3999999999999s)]
*  Took this head on the day it happened. I think [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1647.96s)]
*  That answer there that yeah, you know, you're right [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1651.72s)]
*  Like we may never know exactly what happened to lexie navalny, but there is no doubt that this is vladimir putin's fault [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1653.8000000000002s)]
*  That you know led him to die at age 47. He's not an old man. He's just gonna drop dead [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1659.16s)]
*  and also, you know, I think biden was kind of trying to temper expectations there by [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1664.92s)]
*  Being honest that there's just not a ton more diplomatically the u.s can do [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1669.4s)]
*  Yeah, I mean first of all the fact that he gave this statement, you know [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1673.3200000000002s)]
*  If there's the u.s probably like falls is pretty closely kind of indicates to me that he's dead [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1675.72s)]
*  You know like this idea of like we're not sure [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1680.92s)]
*  Like I don't think he would have gone out. You know, maybe i'm wrong about that. But you know, they probably know [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1683.0s)]
*  um [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1688.92s)]
*  yeah, I think uh [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1690.1200000000001s)]
*  and I think it was right to put the responsibility on putin and [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1691.8000000000002s)]
*  I think the thing i'd say tommy because this whole thing has got me a little reflective and you know, it's late at night in munich and [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1695.24s)]
*  Like you know, we i've been pretty hard on joe biden like of late, you know, uh on gaza [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1700.44s)]
*  um [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1706.2s)]
*  and [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1707.24s)]
*  uh [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1708.6000000000001s)]
*  And obviously we're going through the whole stuff about you know, it's age and you know people run but you know what like [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1709.88s)]
*  This should drive do you want a president what would donald trump say [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1717.72s)]
*  like donald trump [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1722.1200000000001s)]
*  Like he's talking about like, you know telling russia to do whatever the hell it wants. He didn't care in 2020 [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1724.0400000000002s)]
*  Donald trump doesn't give a shit about alexander volney that like this is not a joke people like like [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1728.52s)]
*  This is where it ends [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1736.12s)]
*  Like putin got elected in 2000 [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1737.8s)]
*  And you know [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1741.32s)]
*  It was a 24 year journey [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1742.76s)]
*  To like people getting killed in prison like this [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1745.9599999999998s)]
*  like [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1750.04s)]
*  I don't want to take that chance. No, and so again, I actually thought about this today. It's like, you know, um [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1751.32s)]
*  I think this should drive home the consequences for people you may not love joe biden like [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1758.1999999999998s)]
*  you may have some issues with this policy or but like [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1764.6s)]
*  This is not something to fuck around with you know, yeah, because like this is where it ends [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1769.56s)]
*  This is where this kind of autocracy ends like vodmer putin sitting in the kremlin invading countries and killing people [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1773.7199999999998s)]
*  Like that's where autocracy ends and that's what trump represents, you know [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1779.7199999999998s)]
*  And and like that was I sent you tommy the last exchange I had with navale was it on text was about these people [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1783.72s)]
*  Are all the same, you know [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1788.6799999999998s)]
*  Um, and again, i'm sure trump hasn't done the things putin's done. I'm not suggesting the direct equivalents [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1790.28s)]
*  But this is not something to mess around with and and I think you know [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1795.72s)]
*  that [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1800.52s)]
*  That's something we should remember today. Yeah, listen trump is on the side of the oligarchs [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1801.6399999999999s)]
*  Not the people fighting them. He is on the side of the authoritarians not the people fighting them [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1805.8s)]
*  You would like ben in this speech biden hit congress hard [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1810.3600000000001s)]
*  For going on vacation for two weeks. I didn't realize this congress is in recess for two weeks without, you know passing ukraine funding [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1814.1200000000001s)]
*  They're just letting it dangle out there. Uh biden also uses an opportunity to go hard after trump's comments today about you know [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1820.8400000000001s)]
*  Whether what he would telling putin that he should invade a nato country that hadn't spent two percent of gdp [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1827.0s)]
*  on defense [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1834.2s)]
*  So it was really strong overall you actually got asked about the anti [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1835.64s)]
*  Satellite capability stories that popped up earlier this week by the way folks want to learn more about that [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1839.22s)]
*  We did a uh youtube exclusive pot save the world interview with an expert named james acton that's on our pot save the world [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1844.1200000000001s)]
*  YouTube channel, but yeah, i'm with you ben like listen i've been frustrated with biden on gaza [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1849.8000000000002s)]
*  I think almost everybody would agree that he did an incredible job rallying the world in support of ukraine and deserves a lot of credit [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1854.2s)]
*  For that. Yeah, and just as a general matter we should be on the right side of these things, you know [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1860.68s)]
*  and and uh [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1865.16s)]
*  that that [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1867.4s)]
*  These are these are huge fault lines and you know [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1868.84s)]
*  Like the bottom line is is are you on the right side of this thing? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1872.36s)]
*  And yeah the fact that the that these people are hiding [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1875.56s)]
*  I mean i'm in munich tommy and like one of the people things people are talking about is like lindsey graham used to love [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1878.44s)]
*  To come to this conference every year lindsey graham. He skipped it and went to the border instead, right? [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1883.0s)]
*  But the reason he skipped it is because he's afraid to look these people not that there's such a bunch of badasses here in munich [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1887.56s)]
*  But he's literally afraid to look these people in the face and explain why he opposes his supplemental right? [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1892.84s)]
*  Like these are a bunch of cowards, you know, who don't stand for anything and [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1897.8s)]
*  And the day like today exposes all that. Yeah for sure [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1901.48s)]
*  Uh, so we asked the discord the pod save the world discord for some questions [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1904.9199999999998s)]
*  Uh, they sent in some great ones per usual. So spiffy asks. I love the names on these things [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1908.36s)]
*  Why do you think putin decided to kill navalny now? What does he gain from publicizing this right before his reelection? [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1912.52s)]
*  um, I [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1917.8799999999999s)]
*  ben i'll admit like i've been [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1919.48s)]
*  Wondering this too. I mean [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1921.56s)]
*  Putin has tried to kill navalny a couple times. He could have had him killed at any moment [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1924.04s)]
*  Uh, it is surprising that in the middle of this big political fight in the u.s [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1928.3600000000001s)]
*  Over more ukraine funding that he would [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1933.8s)]
*  And maybe it wasn't sort of directly in his control and that's the answer but for this to happen now [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1937.4s)]
*  Seems like the kind of international news story that just might be able to shame a couple republicans [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1942.28s)]
*  into [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1948.84s)]
*  Finding a backbone and breaking with donald trump and supporting ukraine aid. I mean it's it seems like the most [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1949.72s)]
*  Disadvantages political moment for for putin to do this. Yeah, I mean look there's two there's it's certainly possible that [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1955.6200000000001s)]
*  You know navalny's just been so poisoned over time and and grinded down that that he did have like a blood clot or something [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1962.68s)]
*  You know that um again putin's still responsible because it's because this man has been pumped with poison and treated like in torture conditions [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1969.24s)]
*  If he was killed because of timing [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1976.92s)]
*  Which we don't know and probably never will [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1979.96s)]
*  You know, uh, I think in general [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1982.2s)]
*  Putin seems to be feeling pretty full of himself right now and he's kind of rubbing everybody's face in it [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1985.0800000000002s)]
*  you know the like the tucker carlson interview and like he he's trying to show [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1990.92s)]
*  people in general that [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1997.16s)]
*  He is winning and he's gonna do whatever he wants this munich security conference [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=1998.92s)]
*  By the way, which we can make fun of is because it is kind of like a you know blob reunion [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2003.88s)]
*  But like he had like a weird fixation on that like he came here and gave a speech once about [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2008.6s)]
*  You know telling everybody to you know, uh where to put it. So maybe it's sad. I don't know [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2013.08s)]
*  What I would say is a general matter [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2018.52s)]
*  The message emanating from putin in the kremlin [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2020.6s)]
*  Is I really don't care. I don't care about your sanctions. I don't care about all the aid you give in ukraine [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2023.1599999999999s)]
*  I don't even care about the hundreds of thousands of russians who've been killed and wounded here [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2027.6399999999999s)]
*  like i'm just going to keep being putin and [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2031.72s)]
*  You know, that's something we need to [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2034.28s)]
*  We need to factor in yeah. Hey congrats again tucker carlson on your hard-hitting interview [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2036.44s)]
*  Uh where yes, we didn't ask about navalny by the way sure did not ask that involved sure didn't uh, so two [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2040.52s)]
*  uh discord members miles and zach have similar questions about [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2046.28s)]
*  You know whether there's anyone in the russian opposition that could take up the navalny mantle and sort of lead an opposition party [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2049.8s)]
*  Um, then it's worth pointing out that there is an opposition figure named barice nadirjian who was just barred from running [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2055.96s)]
*  Um, he tried to challenge that ruling and just yesterday his challenge was rejected [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2062.04s)]
*  Nadirjian isn't a true opposition figure the way navalny is he more worked within the system, but he did take an anti-war stance [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2067.56s)]
*  Uh, I suspect it was popular in a lot of quarters, uh, especially with people who are sick of seeing their you know sons and [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2074.7599999999998s)]
*  Friends killed in this meaningless war [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2082.6s)]
*  But you know to our point earlier, it's not obvious who? [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2085.56s)]
*  Uh or how you could lead an opposition movement at this moment. Yeah, there's just not I mean and he even said, uh, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2088.92s)]
*  The guy who's disqualified in his interviews is a guy i'm not as charismatic or popular as alexandre navalny [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2095.6400000000003s)]
*  But you know someone's got to run you that was basically his message and uh, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2099.6400000000003s)]
*  It's just you know, there are a bunch of people in prison. There are a bunch of people out of the country [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2103.8s)]
*  Nobody of this stature [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2107.56s)]
*  Um, there's some movements the infrastructure that what happens to the infrastructure navalny built will be interesting [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2109.4s)]
*  Like I hope it continues because it does this service of exposing corruption [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2114.1200000000003s)]
*  Um, but again, I think ultimately you don't know where it's going to come from [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2118.12s)]
*  I mean, is it some soldier who returns home who's pissed off about what he was made to do in ukraine? [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2122.2799999999997s)]
*  Is it someone out of the country that organizes? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2127.7999999999997s)]
*  It's probably not the worst thing [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2130.12s)]
*  that [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2132.2s)]
*  You know, it's gonna have to kind of organically generate [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2133.64s)]
*  Instead of it just being hung on one person, uh [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2136.7599999999998s)]
*  And and and but there's really not there's not like some next in line here [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2139.7999999999997s)]
*  I think to be at the front front of the russian opposition, you know [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2144.12s)]
*  Then there are these people like kodakowski and gary casper these people out of the country [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2146.6s)]
*  But they they're not as tied in to you know, what's you know, navalny had his finger pretty close to the pulse there [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2150.44s)]
*  Yeah, and so even the prominent exiles. I don't think they they had that standing [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2156.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, if you're spending more time in like brookings than like, you know farms in siberia [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2160.44s)]
*  You probably don't quite have your finger on the pulse [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2164.68s)]
*  I mean it also is interesting then that we're about to be at the two-year anniversary of the full-scale invasion of ukraine [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2166.6s)]
*  I say full-scale because ukrainians will always remind you that the russians started invading ukraine in 2014 with kremia and then of the donbass, etc [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2172.68s)]
*  But a couple folks asked, you know, do you think congress will see this as incentive to continue supporting ukraine? [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2180.68s)]
*  Do you think any republicans will kind of back off their pro-putin pro-autocrat rhetoric as public outrage grows over? [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2185.72s)]
*  his death [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2193.08s)]
*  That's a really great question of sort of how this will break [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2194.6s)]
*  politically ben because you know again [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2197.8599999999997s)]
*  Navalny was poisoned in 2020 when when trump was in charge, I think he viewed kind of [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2200.6s)]
*  any [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2208.6s)]
*  Debate about whether or not he should be critical of putin as an affront to him personally in some sort of tacit [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2209.56s)]
*  You know suggestion that he got help in the election or whatever. It's just like it all got tied up in his narcissism [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2215.88s)]
*  But I mean curious what your take is on [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2222.2s)]
*  Whether this is the kind of thing to break through politically [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2225.08s)]
*  Um, and I wish it were but I don't think so, right? [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2227.8s)]
*  You know, I mean and you you probably have a better sense than me tommy [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2230.68s)]
*  Like I just it feels like [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2233.96s)]
*  The reasons, you know, it's appealing to the conscience of of these republicans [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2236.36s)]
*  Where has that kind of gotten us? Um, I mean I I do think [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2242.04s)]
*  What it will do I think is energize it might energize europe a little bit more [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2247.32s)]
*  I mean it it kind of just reinforces the depths of what we're dealing with in putin [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2251.16s)]
*  And so I think it can only help you know in terms of like what more support can be provided by europe what more [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2255.96s)]
*  You know, can we get some more people in congress to the people that are invested in the in in the supplemental? [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2263.64s)]
*  Maybe we'll feel energized to put more pressure on people, you know [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2269.08s)]
*  um, I just don't know whether it's going to move like a [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2273.64s)]
*  callous [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2276.98s)]
*  self-interested [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2278.42s)]
*  Scared politician like lindsey grant. Yeah, so uh alona just sent around to our slack [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2279.46s)]
*  Uh speaker johnson's statement on namalny's death. I'll skip the first two paragraphs which are not totally germane to this [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2284.6s)]
*  But it said then he says in the coming days as international leaders are meeting in munich [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2289.72s)]
*  We must be clear that putin will be met with united opposition as congress debates the best path forward to support ukraine comma [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2293.48s)]
*  The united states and our partners must be using every means available to cut off putin's ability to fund his unprovoked war in ukraine [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2300.04s)]
*  And aggression against the baltic states. So I mean at face value you read that and think like, okay [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2306.68s)]
*  So you're gonna put the thing on the floor and vote on it, right? [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2311.72s)]
*  But I still worry this coward thinks he's gonna lose his speakership if he supports ukraine [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2314.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I hope so like I hope i'm wrong and like, you know [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2319.0s)]
*  There's a big rally and like an avalny effect and and what's so crazy about that statement is he kind of seems to allude to sanctions [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2321.48s)]
*  Like the sanctions are they're not working people like I hate to tell you like yeah [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2327.08s)]
*  They're they're they work a bit, you know [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2331.8799999999997s)]
*  Like they took some money away from the russian government and the russian oligarchs [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2333.72s)]
*  But they have all these workarounds and so that's like a you know, he's sitting in washington is you know demanding more sanctions [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2338.2s)]
*  Like it's that's not gonna be the thing that works here, you know [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2345.24s)]
*  so that that feels like a [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2349.0s)]
*  The fact that he didn't direct it to the and we're gonna pass funding to support ukraine [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2350.9199999999996s)]
*  But he directed to kind of holding them accountable and blah blah blah like again [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2355.16s)]
*  I hope that it means that they'll act but i'm i'm i'm not that [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2358.68s)]
*  Yeah, optimistic i'm with you there. Uh final question is from exploding gopher [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2363.48s)]
*  Maybe all right minnesotan hopefully [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2367.48s)]
*  Uh or katyshak or katyshak even better will the u.s. Have any response other than biden making a statement [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2369.56s)]
*  What can the u.s or the international community do? [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2375.08s)]
*  I mean, I think the debate we're talking about right now over ukraine funding in congress is obviously [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2377.64s)]
*  The most important thing I do think your point is well taken then that this could motivate or inspire [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2382.36s)]
*  Folks in european capitals to dig deeper and do more [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2389.0s)]
*  I really I mean look rhetorical biden's statement rhetorically was great. Maybe he'll give a big speech about democracy versus autocracy [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2392.92s)]
*  Maybe he'll make it part of the state of the union which is coming up in a couple weeks [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2399.96s)]
*  You could imagine a a big nivolny section there and a messaging effort around it. Um, clearly they [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2403.08s)]
*  They the white house think this fight over nato with trump is politically advantageous for them [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2409.2400000000002s)]
*  um, but I don't know you could also imagine a scenario where trump just fucking [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2415.2400000000002s)]
*  Tweets something terrible and steps in it and creates problems for himself [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2419.32s)]
*  So yeah, I mean, you know, there's in addition to the things we talked about right like this ukraine support [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2422.1200000000003s)]
*  there's potentially the kinds of support for uh [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2427.0s)]
*  The russian opposition that not not to co-op them but to just kind of like help them platform [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2430.44s)]
*  But then there's like, you know the kind of stuff nivolny did like revealing corruption [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2435.1600000000003s)]
*  You know, I always thought the u.s government could do more of that [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2439.4s)]
*  Yeah, like why couldn't the u.s government make the the video about buden's house, you know [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2441.7200000000003s)]
*  Like in a weird way we can learn from nivolny and like [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2446.52s)]
*  You know this if buden feels so vulnerable by this stuff like well, why aren't we doing it? [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2449.64s)]
*  You know and not in like a covert way like in an oh like why not just say like you know [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2454.44s)]
*  What like you ever we know this about you guys and you have a right to know about it, you know [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2458.76s)]
*  Um, so that's another thing. Um, I think like not letting [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2462.76s)]
*  And again, i'm not trying to like make alexia nivolny into [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2467.8s)]
*  like, you know, uh [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2471.96s)]
*  What point I was to make is you can also not let the memory die like pudin's gonna try to like erase [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2474.92s)]
*  This guy, you know, like for sure [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2480.68s)]
*  I think it's important to like remind people that this happened and remind people that's why you know [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2482.04s)]
*  We try to remind people like boris dempsey getting killed in front of kremlin [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2486.36s)]
*  Um, I think you can demand actually I think it's useful to demand international investigations [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2489.4s)]
*  Because they can become pains in the ass, you know, like like you open up all these investigations [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2494.68s)]
*  This is what [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2499.0s)]
*  Zana nimsova did with her dad like the european court of justice and all these other people are like, you know [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2500.1200000000003s)]
*  Interpol notices and yeah [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2505.96s)]
*  Yeah for the rest of time like there should be investigations into how nivolny died [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2507.4s)]
*  To get at julia's point so that like, you know one day [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2512.1200000000003s)]
*  Maybe, you know 10 years from now actually like there's a bunch of people that go to prison for that [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2515.0s)]
*  So so there's stuff that can be done [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2519.1600000000003s)]
*  We just shouldn't think that there's some lever that we can pull and change putin right now. No, I think your point about [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2521.2400000000002s)]
*  Emulating nivolny and his organization and using the billions and billions of dollars [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2527.94s)]
*  invested in the u.s [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2533.64s)]
*  Intelligence community to surface, you know [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2534.68s)]
*  The next billion dollar palace owned by putin and you know release it to the world is a great idea [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2537.48s)]
*  I mean I think and and this is actually, you know an area where the administration [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2542.6s)]
*  Has done a lot of work right in advance of the russian invasion. They were declassifying all kinds of intelligence [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2546.84s)]
*  jakes olivan was talking about this [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2551.64s)]
*  Uh from the podium a couple days ago, they're incredibly proud of what they think is a a novel and uh, [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2553.48s)]
*  Clever approach to using intelligence. I agree with them [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2560.12s)]
*  And I think your idea is a good one in a way they could build on it [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2562.44s)]
*  And one last thing on that tommy is like a good legacy is to go after kleptocracy even harder [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2565.56s)]
*  You know like go after the oligarch like give you know accelerate the process of giving that money to the ukrainians like [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2570.12s)]
*  You know, uh do the things that he stood for that were right. Yeah paging. Uh, uh folks in london [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2576.04s)]
*  You know, we're looking at you there to crack down some of these kleptocrats [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2582.28s)]
*  Um, I did notice ben that a friend of the pod max seddon great journalist [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2585.1600000000003s)]
*  Uh, who's covered russia for a long time said that russians in moscow are lining up to lay flowers in memory of namalny [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2589.7200000000003s)]
*  And a memorial to gulag victims outside of fsb headquarters [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2595.4s)]
*  Um, that's pretty brave [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2599.4s)]
*  Uh given you know the likelihood that those people will now be monitored forever or cracked down on [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2601.8s)]
*  Um, it sounds like police have detained several people [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2606.76s)]
*  Uh at makeshift memorials in moscow [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2609.48s)]
*  Um, some of our people are chanting and throwing snowballs at them and chanting shame [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2612.36s)]
*  So there are you know, clearly in these initial hours some russians who are doing very brave things and who are incredibly upset [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2617.0s)]
*  And angry about you know, this brazen assassination of a of a political figure [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2624.12s)]
*  Yeah, i'm glad you said that because it'll be interesting to see what kind of protests are we shouldn't expect that they're going to like topple the government [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2629.56s)]
*  But like I think you'll see those kinds of demonstrations and I think what we should say tommy is like [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2634.84s)]
*  Yeah, look I you know, I talked about like, you know a few communications with the guy like [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2639.8s)]
*  This guy meant a lot [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2644.6000000000004s)]
*  to [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2646.44s)]
*  A lot of russians and I feel really bad today [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2647.8s)]
*  for obviously first and foremost his family but like [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2651.4s)]
*  You know, what if you're just some young person that really lucked up as an avalny and you're living in [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2654.28s)]
*  You know not even moscow you're living, you know in vladivostok or wherever [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2659.2400000000002s)]
*  How you must be feeling now must you must just feel [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2664.92s)]
*  Like [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2668.6800000000003s)]
*  All is lost, you know like that they've taken away everything now [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2669.7200000000003s)]
*  They've taken away this guy that was the guy that made you feel strong and and again, I hope in that kind of [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2672.76s)]
*  You know russian way that that isn't channeled to giving up. It's kind of channeled into like well, you know what like [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2678.92s)]
*  You know, we're gonna remember how this feels and [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2688.2000000000003s)]
*  When we have an opening, you know, we're gonna take it, you know, but I think we should I feel bad [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2691.08s)]
*  I just can't imagine how how that feels to be [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2697.24s)]
*  Like a russian who wishes it was different. Yeah [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2700.4399999999996s)]
*  You know you're looking around you and you know, the economy has been wrecked by the invasion of ukraine and international sanctions [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2702.8399999999997s)]
*  I mean the whole economy now is basically a war economy [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2709.8799999999997s)]
*  Every male under a certain age is being dragged into conscription from parts of the country [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2714.12s)]
*  so yeah, I mean I think [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2719.56s)]
*  Desperate times like that, you know oppression can lead to some incredibly brave and bold reactions [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2721.56s)]
*  And especially when you're inspired by someone like namalny, I think your point earlier is like yeah [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2727.3999999999996s)]
*  We probably shouldn't be looking to like a gary caspar off [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2731.56s)]
*  To and expect that type of person to lead the next revolution right in tunisia [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2734.04s)]
*  It was a a fruit vendor who just felt so demoralized and disrespected by the government that he lit himself on fire [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2738.4399999999996s)]
*  And it sparked off the entire arab spring [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2744.04s)]
*  And so, you know, those are the kinds of things that no one will ever be able to predict not us not the intelligence community [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2745.72s)]
*  Not anybody it will come from some [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2751.08s)]
*  Uh grassroots frustration [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2753.08s)]
*  Um, and it won't be because of some like sanction that we did after you know, like like that's the thing [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2755.3199999999997s)]
*  It'll be because of what russians do the 400th sanction on, you know foreign assets that no longer exist [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2759.56s)]
*  Um, well listen ben is super late there, uh in munich [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2764.92s)]
*  I'm super grateful that you are uh, uh willing to get on the phone and talk now any any final thoughts before we wrap it [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2767.56s)]
*  No, I I just it i'm yeah, i'm sorry if i'm uh, you know grown on because I was tired I I guess [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2772.68s)]
*  you know my my [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2779.96s)]
*  My last thought was it was interesting talking to navalny [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2782.52s)]
*  In the pandemic when you know he [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2787.0s)]
*  he was home with his family and [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2790.28s)]
*  you know, he's about my age and [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2793.64s)]
*  And this guy like [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2796.68s)]
*  You know, he's a charismatic guy [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2798.6s)]
*  Like he could have [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2801.16s)]
*  Moved to the west and you know been some celebrity [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2803.08s)]
*  Exile guy and again that that's not to to criticize [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2806.44s)]
*  You know, I think there's a very good place for celebrity exile people. He could have done all kinds of things. He you know, um [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2809.64s)]
*  It's pretty extraordinary that [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2817.3199999999997s)]
*  um [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2820.2799999999997s)]
*  You know his decision if you watch that navalny documentary it shows the flight into moscow where he knows what's gonna happen when he lands [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2821.88s)]
*  And he's on this plane and everybody's gawking at him and he's he's literally playing call of duty or something [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2828.6800000000003s)]
*  He's just clearly trying to zone out, you know [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2833.96s)]
*  and [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2836.2000000000003s)]
*  But he's looking out the window. He wanted to be in russia. He wanted to die in russia [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2837.0s)]
*  and he wanted to be on russian soil and [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2841.6400000000003s)]
*  There's something really powerful about that [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2847.0800000000004s)]
*  and like that's part of russian history too like like a lot of people went to the gulags and [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2849.6400000000003s)]
*  you know [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2855.5600000000004s)]
*  Everybody did a turn in syberia and like not everybody got out, you know, and [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2856.68s)]
*  And I think we just have to remember this this is not just like some like on this is like a human being [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2860.52s)]
*  I saw like our friend of the pod bobby whine post about this, you know, like that that kind of guts gives other people courage [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2865.08s)]
*  Yeah, and [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2871.8799999999997s)]
*  And I don't think we should let the message be that it's not worth it. I think the message should be [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2873.24s)]
*  people will not ever forget that and that [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2878.9199999999996s)]
*  Other people are going to step up in their own ways in their own countries [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2882.12s)]
*  Because we can't let [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2887.08s)]
*  This win we cannot let this kind of [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2889.7999999999997s)]
*  thuggish kleptocratic [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2894.2s)]
*  Self-interested authoritarianism that tries to grind you down and make you think that nothing matters. Nothing can ever change [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2896.4199999999996s)]
*  That's what vile repute wants you to think by killing luxe and avalny [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2903.3199999999997s)]
*  And I think navalny what he wants us to think by flying back to russia is think that no it can change but only if [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2906.6s)]
*  If people are willing to stand up to it [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2912.44s)]
*  And and and that that's what we should take away. Absolutely. And you know what vladimir putin you, uh, [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2914.28s)]
*  You might have killed the guy, but you'd also immortalized him [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2919.48s)]
*  You know, I think he's someone who's a historic figure now who will be in every history book every textbook [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2921.88s)]
*  Going forward even if you try to erase them, you're gonna die too, buddy [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRD1m3C6bc&t=2927.1600000000003s)]
