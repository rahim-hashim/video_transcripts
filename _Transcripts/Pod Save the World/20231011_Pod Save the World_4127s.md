# What's Next For Gaza & Israel as Destruction & Violence Intensifies?
**Pod Save the World:** [October 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA)
*  Welcome to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Ben Rhodes. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1.8800000000000001s)]
*  Ben, I have no playful banter for you today. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2.88s)]
*  It's not kind of a banter world out there right now. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=5.76s)]
*  No, it's been a dark, dark, dark couple of days. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=7.96s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=10.6s)]
*  Obviously, we're going to focus on Israel and Gaza almost exclusively today, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=11.96s)]
*  including the latest horrifying statistics, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=16.8s)]
*  the policy and intelligence failure by the Israeli government, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=18.92s)]
*  the situation in Gaza as the IDF conducts this airstrike campaign, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=22.16s)]
*  Biden's response, the international response, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=26.36s)]
*  and then a bit of an explainer on what Hamas is. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  And then, Ben, you did the interview this week. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=30.52s)]
*  Who did you talk to? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=32.8s)]
*  I talked to Greg Carlstrom, who's the Middle East correspondent for The Economist [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=33.72s)]
*  and a really great Twitter follow on a website that's been unusually bad. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=37.36s)]
*  Honestly, great. Yeah. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=43.12s)]
*  But he's the one to follow. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=44.44s)]
*  We talked about the kind of political dynamics in Israel. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=46.64s)]
*  Where is that going? Is there going to be a unity government? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  How is Bibi in trouble? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=53.16s)]
*  We talked about the Palestinian leadership [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  and how we got to this moment, why Hamas is doing this, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=56.76s)]
*  how weak the Palestinian authority is. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=59.36s)]
*  And we talked about the region and the fate of the Abraham Accords, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=61.12s)]
*  the fate of the normalization deal, Saudi Arabia, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=66.12s)]
*  how people are responding in the Arab world. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=68.36s)]
*  And, you know, actually, the most interesting thing he said, I thought, was [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  he's been talking to some Hamas guys [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=76.52s)]
*  and he makes this point that the Hamas guys [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=79.68s)]
*  seem like surprised that it went, I don't want to say well. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=83.11999999999999s)]
*  There are a couple of articles where they're saying that. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=87.28s)]
*  Yeah, and that speaks to the intelligence failure, right? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=88.83999999999999s)]
*  That essentially the Hamas guys thought we're just going to throw a bunch of guys [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=92.19999999999999s)]
*  at the barrier and maybe get a couple of hostages, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=95.24s)]
*  maybe get some guys in the hang gliders. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=98.0s)]
*  And they they were kind of shocked that that all those guys got in. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=99.56s)]
*  And so he, you know, he said it was kind of a catastrophic success for Hamas. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=104.36s)]
*  And that that rings pretty true, actually. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=108.91999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's one reason you should like Greg. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=112.6s)]
*  He tweeted the other day, just to add a note of humility [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  to what I've been writing about for the past few days. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=117.6s)]
*  I don't know what the fuck is going on. No one does. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=119.36s)]
*  We're all trying to figure this out in real time. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  Covered this region for a decade and a half. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=123.36s)]
*  Cannot remember a time everyone was so confused. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=125.32s)]
*  Anyone that approaches foreign policy with humility like that, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  I think is worth listening to. Yeah. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=131.79999999999998s)]
*  The most honest take on Twitter, because boy, is that rare. Yeah. OK. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=133.68s)]
*  Seamless transition to the horrible situation on the ground in Israel and Gaza here. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=137.51999999999998s)]
*  So then the Israeli military finally this morning said that all Hamas fighters [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=141.64s)]
*  have been killed or pushed out of Israel. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=146.04s)]
*  But there are still ongoing rocket attacks out of Gaza. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=148.11999999999998s)]
*  Watching CNN this morning, you know, reporters literally like having to duck [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  in the middle of live shots. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=153.72s)]
*  Some very grim statistics from the Israeli side. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=155.27999999999997s)]
*  And we'll cover the Gaza piece of this after the latest Israeli death toll [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=158.16s)]
*  is estimated at between 900 to 1000 people. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=161.27999999999997s)]
*  At least 14 American citizens were killed. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=164.35999999999999s)]
*  At least 2400 Israelis have been reported wounded. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=166.44s)]
*  Israel's UN envoy says that 100 to 150 people have been taken hostage. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=169.88s)]
*  Dozens of foreign nationals are among those kidnapped, including Americans. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=174.36s)]
*  The IDF says they have recovered the bodies of 1500 dead Hamas fighters [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=177.72s)]
*  inside Israel that just like, yeah, gets to the scale of this attack. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=182.52s)]
*  I think when we were talking on Saturday, we were like, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=185.88s)]
*  oh, could it be a couple dozen, maybe 100 Hamas fighters cross the border? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=188.76s)]
*  No, 1500 dead Hamas militants in the Israeli military [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=191.76s)]
*  has mobilized 360,000 reservists. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  Out of a country of 10 million people. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=199.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I guess where to start here. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=201.6s)]
*  You know, the the images [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=205.8s)]
*  and stories that are coming out of the horrific nature of these attacks. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=208.88s)]
*  You know, not only are they appalling, but they kind of reminded me of [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=214.88s)]
*  some of the early days of ISIS, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=219.68s)]
*  where there was this kind of intent to shock. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=222.36s)]
*  And, you know, that that's going to have a kind of traumatizing effect, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=226.0s)]
*  you know, in Israeli society. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=231.36s)]
*  I mean, it's clearly shaping the emotions over there now, understandably. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=232.88s)]
*  And you just feel for obviously not just people who died, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=237.12s)]
*  but the the trauma that's been inflicted on people who had to experience that. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=240.44s)]
*  I mean, on the other pieces. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=244.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I was really struck by the 1500 number because, you know, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=246.84s)]
*  clearly some guys also got back into Gaza because they brought all these hostages back. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=250.72s)]
*  So that number was probably, you know, 3000. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=254.72s)]
*  And I can't believe that that many people were read into this. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=257.68s)]
*  You know, so it's almost like as I was saying with Greg Carlstrom, like [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=261.40000000000003s)]
*  they busted through the barrier and were like, wait a second, nobody's here. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=266.08000000000004s)]
*  You know, and and so then all these people poured in. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=269.36s)]
*  So does it speaks to this question of the intelligence and military planning [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=272.16s)]
*  failure, the kind of failure of imagination of what could happen there. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=276.68s)]
*  And the call up to me, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=281.16s)]
*  you know, as unfortunately, I think we'll talk about Gaza, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=283.6s)]
*  like there'll be likely a ground invasion. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=287.72s)]
*  Three hundred sixty thousand reservists to me doesn't. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=290.24s)]
*  Those guys aren't all going to go to Gaza. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=293.0s)]
*  What that tells me is they're trying to send a message to his below, you know, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=295.04s)]
*  like we are fully mobilized. We're ready for you. We're ready. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=298.44s)]
*  And so I think a lot of those people are going to be partly having that deterrent [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=301.76000000000005s)]
*  effect. And then also, sadly, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=306.76000000000005s)]
*  we've already seen kind of like settler violence and and and, you know, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=310.03999999999996s)]
*  the attacks on Palestinians kind of happening sporadically. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=316.03999999999996s)]
*  That could lead to kind of Palestinian response. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=320.84s)]
*  So they may also need those reservists in the West Bank. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=322.76s)]
*  So it just kind of foreshadows, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=325.24s)]
*  ominously, like the scale that this war could be. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=327.64s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, like a battalion of soldiers is a thousand guys. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=330.47999999999996s)]
*  Fifteen hundred mean that it's like a mini army. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=333.68s)]
*  As you we reference at the top, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=336.68s)]
*  a lot more information has come out about how just just how massive this [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=338.44s)]
*  intelligence failure was and how big of a policy failure it was by the Israeli [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=342.08s)]
*  government. So on Saturday, we mentioned some like sort of small reports [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=345.96s)]
*  that military posts in the south of Israel near Gaza were understaffed [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=350.12s)]
*  because the IDF had shifted units to the West Bank. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=354.4s)]
*  That was confirmed in a bunch of places. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=357.2s)]
*  The Washington Post quoted the former IDF military intelligence chief saying, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=358.84000000000003s)]
*  quote, there was a need for more soldiers. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=364.16s)]
*  So where did they take them from? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=365.8s)]
*  From the Gaza border where they thought it was calm. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=367.04s)]
*  Not surprising that Hamas and Islamic Jihad noticed the low staffing at the border. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=369.92s)]
*  Multiple Israeli outlets reported that Egyptian intelligence officials say [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=373.88s)]
*  they notified their counterparts in Israel with warnings that Hamas was planning [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=379.36s)]
*  something, quote, something big was the quote, I think. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=384.04s)]
*  The Times of Israel said that that included a direct call to Bibi Netanyahu. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=386.76s)]
*  Now Netanyahu's office denied that that happened, but notable. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=390.68s)]
*  And then Haaretz reported that part of Netanyahu's strategy [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=393.84000000000003s)]
*  to prevent the creation of a Palestinian state was over time to bolster Hamas. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=398.12s)]
*  This is apparently a quote from Netanyahu. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=403.24s)]
*  Anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=406.0s)]
*  has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=408.8s)]
*  Netanyahu told a meeting of his Likud parties, Knesset members in March 2019. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=412.12s)]
*  This is part of our strategy to isolate the Palestinians and Gaza [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=416.44s)]
*  from the Palestinians in the West Bank. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=419.16s)]
*  So then I'll stop there again. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=420.68s)]
*  This is not blaming the Palestinian government for what happened. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=423.32s)]
*  Hamas is responsible for the terrorist attack that happened. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=425.68s)]
*  But this is helping explain why you're seeing like major newspaper [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=428.48s)]
*  editorials in Israel saying things like the attack is, quote, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=433.56s)]
*  the clear responsibility of one person, Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=438.08s)]
*  This is an intelligence failure, a policy failure, a failure of leadership. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=441.16s)]
*  And the consequences have been horrific. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=445.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you know, in Israel, you see much more [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=448.28000000000003s)]
*  vocal discussion around this than even in the US, you know, and this is much more. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=453.24s)]
*  And this isn't, you know, wacky leftist. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=458.16s)]
*  You know, these are people who fucking hate Hamas and know full well [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=460.64s)]
*  who is responsible Hamas. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=465.2s)]
*  But the vital context here is, look, as a matter of policy, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=467.68s)]
*  I felt this when we were in government. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=472.72s)]
*  I mean, Bibi seemed to want to weaken the Palestinian authority, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=475.28000000000003s)]
*  at least relative to Hamas, you know, like because he didn't want a partner for peace. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=480.0s)]
*  And so he was kind of constantly humiliating Abu Mazen, you know, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=485.6s)]
*  settlement announcements right after meetings, you know, things that made Abu Mazen [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=490.8s)]
*  the leader of the Palestinian Authority look that's what we call a Mahmoud Abbas. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=495.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. When you're in the biz. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=499.0s)]
*  Sorry. And at the same time, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=501.52s)]
*  you know, Hamas is who he wants to be the face of the Palestinians, right? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=505.72s)]
*  Because it justifies repression. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=508.72s)]
*  And and so that wasn't like a that wasn't hard to figure out [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=510.88000000000005s)]
*  that that was kind of the play that he's pursued as a matter of policy for a long time. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=515.2s)]
*  But the degree of failure around, I mean, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=520.4s)]
*  Tommy, you're I think buddies with Amir Tabon, right? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=524.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. How are its reporter who is, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=527.2s)]
*  you know, he tells this harrowing story of being nine and a half hours [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=530.2s)]
*  in the safe room with his two kids under four. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=534.6800000000001s)]
*  And he has this very powerful line where he's like, we were alone. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=537.3199999999999s)]
*  And he was, you could tell, like, really angry about it. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=540.12s)]
*  Like, where was the military? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=543.0s)]
*  And you would you would think there'd be more IDF near the board of Gaza. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=544.9599999999999s)]
*  But because these lunatics in the government have empowered these settlers [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=549.28s)]
*  and there are all these skirmishes in the West Bank, they sent those people up there. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=553.4399999999999s)]
*  And that's that's just what happened. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=557.88s)]
*  You know, I mean, we don't know the details of the Egyptian warnings. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=559.8s)]
*  We do know that the military kept warning him that the protest movement, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=563.0s)]
*  you know, the judicial coup was kind of threatening unity [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=566.32s)]
*  and that created vulnerability. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=569.32s)]
*  So this is pretty clearly something, you know, Bibi Nanyahu has to answer for. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=570.5200000000001s)]
*  And I think that the sad thing is, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=576.36s)]
*  you know, even though Israelis will rally together and have rallied together, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=579.6400000000001s)]
*  you just I wish they had better leadership for their for their sake. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=583.5600000000001s)]
*  For their sake. This is not me because I don't like the guy. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=586.84s)]
*  I just I look at this and I'm like, man, I wish these people deserve better. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=589.6400000000001s)]
*  You know, Amir Tabon's amazing reporter for Haaretz. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=592.6400000000001s)]
*  You should follow him on Twitter. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=595.68s)]
*  He's been on the show before he moved to that community. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=596.8399999999999s)]
*  I talked about this in Paz America. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=600.12s)]
*  He moved to a community right near Gaza because he was so inspired [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=601.28s)]
*  by his time he spent there when he was covering them in the wake of another [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=605.12s)]
*  clash because the people are so committed to peace. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=610.0s)]
*  And so he moved to this community and he said, like, the kind of deal [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=612.9599999999999s)]
*  that was struck by these with the Israeli government was [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=615.5999999999999s)]
*  having communities along the Gaza border kind of helped protect the Israeli border. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=618.8s)]
*  But in return, you're supposed to get security. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=622.16s)]
*  You're supposed to have IDF support. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=623.68s)]
*  And, you know, what the Israeli government did was they built a border fence [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=625.16s)]
*  and they built that fence deep into the ground with concrete to prevent tunneling [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=627.8s)]
*  because that was the threat in the past. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=631.6s)]
*  But this time, these Hamas guys just drove bulldozers into the fence [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=633.48s)]
*  and drove through and Amir, you know, tells this unbelievably [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=637.0s)]
*  harrowing story of being in a safe room with his one year old and his three year [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=639.88s)]
*  old daughters, convincing them to be silent for 10 hours with no food. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=642.56s)]
*  Yeah. A little bit of water. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=646.6s)]
*  And Amir's 62 year old father, a retired [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=648.04s)]
*  Israeli general, drove down from Tel Aviv. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=652.04s)]
*  Yeah. Rescued countless people along the way and fought his fucking way [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=654.64s)]
*  to his son's house and saved their whole lives. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=659.16s)]
*  I mean, it's the most unbelievable story I've ever heard. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=661.92s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, like I told Amir, like whatever the Congressional Medal of Honor is, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=664.1999999999999s)]
*  like his father should get it. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=668.4s)]
*  But also, you never you should not be. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=670.08s)]
*  He also he linked up with another 67 year old [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=672.36s)]
*  Israeli retired general. Yeah. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=675.8s)]
*  And the two of them and Amir's mom were fighting their way down from Tel Aviv. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=677.4s)]
*  How was that the the the security status quo? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=681.4s)]
*  First of all, can you imagine the moment with that grandfather, like, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=686.48s)]
*  you know, hugged his grandchildren? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=689.72s)]
*  It's just hard to think about. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=691.28s)]
*  Hard to think about. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=692.64s)]
*  I can't fathom it, Tommy, because like I have to imagine [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=695.3199999999999s)]
*  that the Gaza border is one of the most heavily surveilled places. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=700.1999999999999s)]
*  Right. There's got to be constant overhead. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=704.52s)]
*  Scencers, right. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=706.56s)]
*  And so I don't understand why from the moment [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=707.84s)]
*  bulldozers are like hitting these wall, it took nine and a half hours to get down there. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=710.84s)]
*  How are they not, you know, Special Forces guys in a helicopter? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=714.72s)]
*  Look, I realize we all learned in Benghazi, like, yeah, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=717.9200000000001s)]
*  Special Forces troops don't sit in their kit in a plane all day long. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=720.9200000000001s)]
*  Right. But like Tel Aviv's an hour and 20 minutes from the Gaza border. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=724.5600000000001s)]

*  who live through and experience this tragedy firsthand. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=891.48s)]
*  These are excerpts we took from interviews by CNN, NBC, PBS, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=894.28s)]
*  an organization called Stand With Us. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=899.56s)]
*  And I think, you know, what you'll hear helps explain why Olaf Bend, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=901.64s)]
*  the editor of Haaretz, said this is the worst calamity [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=905.0s)]
*  that Israel has faced since the founding in 1948. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=907.8000000000001s)]
*  So here are some of those clips. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=910.8000000000001s)]
*  We understood that we want they want to kill, to kill me, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=911.9200000000001s)]
*  to kill my friends, to kill everyone they see. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=917.96s)]
*  So we eat in a little tree. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=921.12s)]
*  We didn't make any sound for nine hours. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=926.96s)]
*  We stayed in the tree and that's how we saved our lives. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=931.24s)]
*  I was lying in the floor. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=937.4799999999999s)]
*  It was the second hidden that I find. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=938.68s)]
*  And they were just all around me. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=941.12s)]
*  And they were going tree by tree and shooting [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=943.12s)]
*  everywhere from two sides. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=948.04s)]
*  And I saw many people like people were dying, like all around. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=950.28s)]
*  I'll tell you one story that really hit home with me where I started to cry. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=954.88s)]
*  Yesterday, I was treating people in critical condition. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=958.1999999999999s)]
*  It's intimidating them doing chest decompressions all the time. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=960.92s)]
*  When I met two kids that just had were held hostage. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=963.92s)]
*  Somehow we're in a closet for 12 hours. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=966.8399999999999s)]
*  Finally escaped. The army came in and got them out. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=970.16s)]
*  And after that, they said to me, my parents, I saw my parents get killed in front of me. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=972.88s)]
*  I'm hungry. I haven't eaten in the last 12 hours. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=976.76s)]
*  I told them to stop everything and go go to to the safe room. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=978.92s)]
*  But in seven thirty five, we lost contact with them. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=982.8s)]
*  And we didn't know what happened. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=987.7199999999999s)]
*  And I talked with my brother that lives in Gaza as well. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=990.92s)]
*  And he told me after a few hours, he told me that my mom text him [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=996.8s)]
*  there is a terrorist in the house and she thinks my dad is dead. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1002.36s)]
*  And then I make it unimaginable. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1007.9599999999999s)]
*  OK, so, Ben, you know, since the the Hamas attack occurred, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1011.0799999999999s)]
*  there have been reprisal, IDF airstrikes in Gaza. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1013.8s)]
*  So we want to turn to the Gaza Strip. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1017.0799999999999s)]
*  Health officials in Gaza say that so far, at least eight hundred [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1019.3199999999999s)]
*  and thirty people have been killed in four thousand two hundred and fifty [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1022.28s)]
*  people have been wounded. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1025.28s)]
*  And again, we're recording this at like one thirty on Tuesday, October 10th. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1026.12s)]
*  That number is going to go up and up and up. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1029.6399999999999s)]
*  So an already deplorable, unacceptable level of likely high civilian casualties. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1030.92s)]
*  The Israeli defense minister announced there would be a complete siege of Gaza, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1037.48s)]
*  saying, quote, no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel would be allowed into the Gaza Strip. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1040.84s)]
*  Of course, Gaza is already blockaded. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1045.44s)]
*  What he's describing there, Ben, does sound like it would lead to [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1047.88s)]
*  the collective punishment of the entire population of Gaza, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1051.0s)]
*  which to me sounds like the textbook definition of a war crime. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1054.5600000000002s)]
*  But we can get back to that. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1057.96s)]
*  The Bush administration, remember, Israel occupied Gaza until 2005. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1060.24s)]
*  They withdrew with the Bush administration, pushed the Palestinian [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1064.7600000000002s)]
*  authority to hold elections in Gaza in 2006. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1067.24s)]
*  Hamas won those elections. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1070.48s)]
*  They've been in charge ever since. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1071.72s)]
*  And Israel's had a blockade on Gaza ever since, ostensibly to keep [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1072.92s)]
*  weapons out of the hands of Hamas. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1076.24s)]
*  But obviously that has not worked. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1077.5200000000002s)]
*  Two million people live in Gaza. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1079.0800000000002s)]
*  It has been described as an open air prison. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1080.4s)]
*  Half the population are under 19. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1082.3600000000001s)]
*  The unemployment rate is around 50 percent. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1085.1200000000001s)]
*  Sixty five percent of the population lives in poverty. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1087.24s)]
*  Gazans lack basic services like health care and clean water. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1090.0400000000002s)]
*  So Ben Axios reported that Netanyahu told Biden that, quote, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1093.68s)]
*  we have to go in. We can't negotiate now. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1097.8400000000001s)]
*  Meaning sounds like he's going to send ground forces to Gaza. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1100.4s)]
*  This has been described by Bibi as a long and difficult war to come. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1104.0s)]
*  So, you know, kind of we talked about this Saturday, Ben, like this is the worst [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1108.0s)]
*  case scenario. No water, no electricity, nowhere to hide. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1110.72s)]
*  Half the population are kids. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1113.8799999999999s)]
*  They weren't alive to vote for Hamas at the time, let alone like you don't let kids vote. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1115.28s)]
*  Right. So, you know, I get that any country, any leader [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1119.56s)]
*  would do what it takes to rescue 150 hostages. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1124.0s)]
*  And I think anyone would probably feel the need to retaliate to Hamas, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1127.56s)]
*  to decapitate its leadership, to prevent an attack like this in the future. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1132.16s)]
*  But where I'm struggling to understand is I don't know that we can have confidence [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1135.8400000000001s)]
*  that the airstrikes at this clip can be targeted at militants only [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1139.72s)]
*  because it seems like Israel's intelligence about Hamas is not as good as they thought it was. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1144.0800000000002s)]
*  We know that Hamas co-locates in civilian areas by design. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1150.0400000000002s)]
*  That's a strategy. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1153.72s)]
*  And there is so much pressure on Netanyahu to respond forcefully and respond quickly. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1155.44s)]
*  But what is the end game here? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1160.0400000000002s)]
*  Is it to reoccupy Gaza? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1161.48s)]
*  That's that's the right question, Tommy, because like one of the perplexing things [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1162.96s)]
*  is Netanyahu has not articulated any objectives yet. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1167.32s)]
*  I mean, he comes on and he uses like tough sounding language about [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1170.28s)]
*  we're going to make these people remember this for generations and stuff like that. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1174.04s)]
*  But are they going to reoccupy Gaza? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1177.32s)]
*  Are they going to try to destroy all of Hamas? [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1180.84s)]
*  You know, essentially regime change? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1184.6s)]
*  Are they trying to rescue the hostages? [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1186.08s)]
*  We don't know yet what the objective of a perspective ground invasion would be, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1188.56s)]
*  but it does feel like it's building something very big. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1194.1599999999999s)]
*  So it does feel like it's probably to to destroy Hamas as the governing entity in Gaza. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1197.0s)]
*  And the amount of people that that would be killed in that scale of a ground invasion [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1203.04s)]
*  is just horrifying to think about. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1210.44s)]
*  And to your point, you know, I saw [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1212.72s)]
*  one of the IDF statements made reference to like hitting a target that they, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1216.08s)]
*  you know, believe was associated with this attack. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1220.56s)]
*  And it's kind of like, well, you know, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1223.1599999999999s)]
*  do they didn't know that the attack was coming? [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1226.3999999999999s)]
*  Like, how do they know that's your point? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1228.8799999999999s)]
*  Like, what does that say about their intelligence? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1230.9199999999998s)]
*  You know, if you miss something that big, how do you know the address [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1233.4799999999998s)]
*  of all the Hamas military wing members, you know, when they've obviously been moving around? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1237.08s)]
*  And and you see already these apartment buildings destroyed [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1241.04s)]
*  where obviously not everybody could possibly be Hamas. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1244.64s)]
*  And look, if we're all understandably and should be [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1249.5200000000002s)]
*  incredibly impacted by hearing innocent Israelis describe losing a loved one, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1253.92s)]
*  I'm going to be horrified [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1259.44s)]
*  in an already end that there are innocent people losing their loved ones [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1261.8400000000001s)]
*  in Gaza who didn't who were just as innocent as the Israelis. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1265.76s)]
*  Like these are not like the whole city of two million people [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1269.24s)]
*  and one million who were children are are in Hamas. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1272.44s)]
*  And, you know, living in Gaza doesn't mean you support Hamas. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1276.3600000000001s)]
*  Hamas governs by force and coercion, by repression and corruption. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1278.8400000000001s)]
*  People probably fucking sick of them for all kinds of reasons, you know. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1282.8s)]
*  And like, look, if you conduct a siege, a siege of Gaza, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1285.64s)]
*  I guarantee you that the guys with the guns, the Hamas guys will be the first in line [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1288.56s)]
*  to take whatever remaining gas and water and food is there. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1292.88s)]
*  The women and children are going to be last. Right. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1296.44s)]
*  Like they're going to be harmed first. Yeah. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1298.0s)]
*  And when you cut off electricity, right, that's [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1299.4s)]
*  that's cutting off power to hospitals. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1301.28s)]
*  I mean, you know, there's a reason that after World War Two, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1302.72s)]
*  you know, people got together and were like, you know what? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1307.52s)]
*  We need some rules, some laws around war. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1309.44s)]
*  And the principle rule is that you don't have collective punishment. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1311.92s)]
*  You go after military targets. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1317.16s)]
*  And look, the US has not always followed that rule in Vietnam. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1318.92s)]
*  So, you know, Israel is not being singled out as the only country that does this. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1322.16s)]
*  But to essentially announce a policy of collective punishment [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1326.28s)]
*  that, you know, that that's a very ominous. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1330.88s)]
*  And the rhetoric was like, these are animals. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1334.16s)]
*  These are dehumanizing rhetoric. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1335.88s)]
*  And that that's what people have to tell themselves to convince themselves to do [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1339.16s)]
*  horrible things. And and look like [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1343.8000000000002s)]
*  you should care about that for humanitarian purpose [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1347.3200000000002s)]
*  and just a human being purpose and a moral purpose. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1350.72s)]
*  But also, it's bad policy. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1353.2800000000002s)]
*  This policy of just no political track at all. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1355.88s)]
*  And this right in two states, Lucian didn't succeed in protecting Israel. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1360.0s)]
*  You know, so it's a sincere I know people will not agree [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1365.16s)]
*  with the idea that there should be any restraint here whatsoever. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1369.64s)]
*  But it's it's it's both out of empathy for the people who did nothing wrong in Gaza. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1372.84s)]
*  But also it's about [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1377.72s)]
*  what is the more sustainable and better way to protect Israel? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1381.04s)]
*  And is it through some kind of ultimate agreement with Palestinians? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1383.56s)]
*  Or is it just this constant cycle of violence? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1387.12s)]
*  Because there are two million people there and you're either going to have to [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1390.32s)]
*  displace all those people, you know, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1392.6s)]
*  or what or this somehow does repeat, you know? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1396.24s)]
*  Yeah. And also, like, if you want those, the hostages survive, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1398.92s)]
*  like indiscriminately bombing Gaza Strip seems like a very scary course of action. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1401.88s)]
*  Yeah. But so, you know, look, but that's that we should say, like [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1406.84s)]
*  decapitating, destroying the military wing of Hamas that did this. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1410.76s)]
*  Like there are there are very legitimate military objectives that Israel [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1414.0s)]
*  has every right to pursue. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1418.24s)]
*  I just it unfortunately feels like it might be going in a different direction. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1419.84s)]
*  I agree. So President Biden delivered [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1425.0s)]
*  remarks again on Tuesday about the situation. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1427.76s)]
*  Here's a clip. Like every nation in the world, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1430.8799999999999s)]
*  Israel has the right to respond, indeed has a duty to respond [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1433.84s)]
*  to these vicious attacks. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1437.72s)]
*  I just got off the phone with a third call with Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1440.84s)]
*  I told him the United States experience [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1446.48s)]
*  that Israel is experiencing our response to be swift, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1449.4s)]
*  decisive and overwhelming. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1452.3600000000001s)]
*  We also discussed how democracies like Israel in the United States [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1455.24s)]
*  are stronger and more secure when we act according to the rule of law. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1458.28s)]
*  Terrorists purposely target civilians, kill them. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1465.3600000000001s)]
*  We uphold the laws of war, the law of war. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1472.64s)]
*  It matters. There's a difference. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1476.16s)]
*  So the White House also said they're going to provide Israel with more [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1477.92s)]
*  interceptors for the Iron Dome missile defense system. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1480.76s)]
*  And President Biden said that he will ask Congress [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1483.6000000000001s)]
*  for more funding for all their security partners. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1487.0800000000002s)]
*  I assume they're going to bundle up some aid for Israel and aid to Ukraine [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1490.16s)]
*  and try to get that voted on at once, which is smart. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1493.8000000000002s)]
*  Ben, so far, Biden's public statements [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1496.52s)]
*  not included a mention of urging restraint. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1499.68s)]
*  The sort of law of war was the thing we just heard there was the closest [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1502.2s)]
*  we got to it on Saturday. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1505.4s)]
*  You know, you and I talked about how we hope behind the scenes [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1507.68s)]
*  that Biden was urging Netanyahu to show restraint. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1510.3200000000002s)]
*  CNN reported that that is not the case. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1513.44s)]
*  Quote, we are not urging restraint right now. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1516.1200000000001s)]
*  One official told CNN they also reported that Biden didn't warn Netanyahu [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1518.8000000000002s)]
*  against a ground invasion. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1522.64s)]
*  So, Ben, you know, again, like given the history of IDF [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1524.16s)]
*  bombing campaigns in Gaza, given the death tolls we're already seeing, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1527.0400000000002s)]
*  given the possibility that there might be American hostages in Gaza. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1531.24s)]
*  Like, I find it shocking, honestly, that the US wouldn't [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1534.56s)]
*  at least privately call for some sort of restraint or proportionality [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1537.96s)]
*  or at least just say, hey, let's not rush this. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1541.4399999999998s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1543.76s)]
*  Because there's going to be really strong political pressure [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1544.3999999999999s)]
*  on Bibi to do something quickly. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1547.8s)]
*  But I don't know that that's the best course of action. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1550.56s)]
*  But again, what do you make of the public messaging? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1552.48s)]
*  And I don't know what do you think the US could be an active participant [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1554.6799999999998s)]
*  in some sort of hostage rescue? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1557.3999999999999s)]
*  Biden said also that there are American hostages. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1559.4399999999998s)]
*  Well, first of all, you know, I think overall Biden is really, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1562.52s)]
*  you know, made it clear that he's kind of unequivocally siding with Israel. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1566.56s)]
*  Yeah, no doubt. There's no there's no gray area. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1570.92s)]
*  Now there's another side to side with. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1574.12s)]
*  But yeah, but he's he's owning it fully, you know, like more military support. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1576.36s)]
*  The aircraft carrier sent to the region, you know, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1581.56s)]
*  as I guess a message to his bull in Iran. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1584.12s)]
*  There was a joint statement yesterday that Biden put out with the leaders [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1587.36s)]
*  of France and UK and Italy and Germany. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1590.0s)]
*  But yeah, I I heard the law of war thing [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1593.68s)]
*  as like the message about restraint. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1598.12s)]
*  But it was like he didn't want to say the word restraint because because it has [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1602.6s)]
*  like a kind of more of a I guess a jargon connotation. Right. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1605.68s)]
*  But, you know, that's a message. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1610.68s)]
*  But it doesn't yet. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1613.16s)]
*  In fact, the reality that he said law of war, not restrained, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1615.24s)]
*  shows that they're not that comfortable pressing Israel on this stuff at all. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1618.2s)]
*  So I do worry that, you know, I mean, look, to your point, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1621.72s)]
*  the decisions are going to get made in the next days, maybe weeks [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1626.44s)]
*  could determine not only like the fate for a lot of people in Gaza [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1631.0s)]
*  and the potential success or not of recovering hostages, but also, you know, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1635.3600000000001s)]
*  does it escalate with Hisbola, right? [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1641.44s)]
*  Who said that a major ground invasion might bring them in like [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1643.3600000000001s)]
*  does and they have one hundred fifty thousand rockets. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1647.04s)]
*  Yeah, they're they're they're a real deal fighting force. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1648.9199999999998s)]
*  Much more sophisticated than Hamas. Right. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1651.76s)]
*  And does Israel hit Iran in some fashion? [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1653.3999999999999s)]
*  So like these are not like the decisions in past Gaza wars, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1656.4399999999998s)]
*  where it's kind of like how many you know, how much we bombarding Hamas. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1660.24s)]
*  And those are important. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1663.1999999999998s)]
*  These are bigger because they could risk wider conflict. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1664.6s)]
*  And so I do hope that there's quiet messaging around. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1667.32s)]
*  Think three times about this, like show some restraint here. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1670.9199999999998s)]
*  So as to not make this something even bigger than it already is. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1674.48s)]
*  But yeah, like thus far, you know, you can feel that they they don't want [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1680.16s)]
*  there to be any question that they are backing Israel in this. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1683.8400000000001s)]
*  And you can understand why. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1688.52s)]
*  But I do just hope that that other message is mixed in [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1691.0800000000002s)]
*  because U.S. interests are implicated. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1694.76s)]
*  I don't know that, you know, U.S. special forces would, you know, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1696.44s)]
*  you know, it's not like rescuing someone in a compound if they're in Gaza. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1700.4s)]
*  So if you that's where these people are like going into Gaza, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1704.36s)]
*  you're going and you're going to be fighting. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1707.32s)]
*  Urban warfare. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1709.16s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, you mentioned this, but it does seem like Biden has repeatedly [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1710.6s)]
*  decided he wants to warn Iran and Hezbollah not to get involved. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1713.56s)]
*  Interesting to know what kind of is backstopping that warning. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1717.12s)]
*  Most of what the consequences might be or what the intel they're seeing is. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1720.56s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1723.28s)]
*  You mentioned they moved the USS Gerald Ford [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1724.68s)]
*  carrier strike group to the Eastern Mediterranean. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1727.08s)]
*  It's a big ass aircraft carrier. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1728.88s)]
*  The fitting Gerald Ford. Yeah. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1732.16s)]
*  Weirdly, the State Department deleted a tweet urging a ceasefire. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1734.72s)]
*  That was on Sunday. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1737.92s)]
*  The State Department Office of Palestinian Affairs deleted a tweet [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1739.0s)]
*  urging all sides to refrain from violence and retaliatory attacks. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1741.6000000000001s)]
*  So, again, you know, no, no asking people to pump the brakes here. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1744.6000000000001s)]
*  Just for context, you know, between 2008 and 2023, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1748.16s)]
*  the UN thinks that Israeli airstrikes killed [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1751.92s)]
*  six thousand four hundred and seven Palestinians in the occupied territories. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1755.24s)]
*  Five thousand three hundred sixty of whom were in Gaza. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1759.1200000000001s)]
*  So, you know, there's been quite a death toll from these airstrikes over time. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1762.24s)]
*  Tony Blinken is going to Israel on Thursday. No surprise there. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1765.4s)]
*  I bet Lloyd Austin could make a similar trip to this. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1768.0800000000002s)]
*  You're going to be seeing a parade of U.S. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1770.8s)]
*  officials going to Israel for consultations and support. Yeah. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1773.16s)]
*  Yeah. You know, the military question will be interesting because, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1777.96s)]
*  you know, does Israel, you know, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1782.68s)]
*  there's some obvious things like financing the replenishment of Iron Dome [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1785.4s)]
*  that they'd want. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1788.56s)]
*  But, you know, what they ask us for [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1790.48s)]
*  gives some indication of what they're planning to do as well. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1793.6399999999999s)]
*  And gives us some ownership of what they do. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1796.12s)]
*  You know, we're like directly supporting, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1798.3999999999999s)]
*  not just with our kind of ongoing three billion dollars a year assistance. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1800.8799999999999s)]
*  Thirty eight billion dollar MOU signed by Barack Obama. Exactly. Right. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1803.96s)]
*  If on top of that, we're providing kind of direct support [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1807.1599999999999s)]
*  for the military operation in Gaza, that would be a greater degree [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1810.6799999999998s)]
*  of U.S. ownership of what happens to. So that that matters. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1814.52s)]
*  Yeah. So the international response has been more mixed. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1818.16s)]
*  On the one hand, you mentioned this, the Western nations [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1822.8400000000001s)]
*  have been showing United Fronts, you got the U.S., the UK, France and Germany [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1826.2s)]
*  in Italy releasing a joint statement. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1829.48s)]
*  They express their steadfast United support for the state of Israel. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1831.44s)]
*  There was unequivocal condemnation of Hamas. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1835.2s)]
*  And they said they make clear that the terrorist actions of Hamas [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1838.1200000000001s)]
*  have no justification, no legitimacy and must be universally condemned [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1841.1200000000001s)]
*  and their support for Israel's right to defend itself. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1845.0800000000002s)]
*  There's also a mention of the Palestinians writing that, quote, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1847.24s)]
*  All of us recognize the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1849.88s)]
*  and support equal measures of justice and freedom for Israelis [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1853.32s)]
*  and Palestinians alike. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1856.04s)]
*  But make no mistake, Hamas does not represent those aspirations. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1857.2s)]
*  And it offers nothing for the Palestinian people other than more terror and bloodshed. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1860.36s)]
*  German politicians have been emphasizing their country's duty towards Israel. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1865.1200000000001s)]
*  The Israeli flag was projected on Saturday night onto Berlin's [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1868.92s)]
*  Brandenburg Gate, also on the White House. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1872.6s)]
*  British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that they would provide [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1875.12s)]
*  intelligence, diplomatic or security support if requested. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1877.6s)]
*  But there's also been some disagreement within the EU [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1880.9199999999998s)]
*  over funding to the Palestinian Authority. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1884.84s)]
*  Initially, they announced there might be a freeze on development aid for Palestine. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1888.7199999999998s)]
*  That was then unfrozen, seemingly. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1893.08s)]
*  I'm not totally sure where we are with that, but we shall see. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1895.7199999999998s)]
*  Then the Saudis, Qataris and Iran basically said [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1899.3999999999999s)]
*  Israel is to blame for the attacks. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1903.3600000000001s)]
*  Iran actively celebrated this attack. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1905.44s)]
*  The Mexican government didn't seem to condemn the, you know, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1909.52s)]
*  there's a couple of Mexican hostages, too, so it's very complicated. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1913.24s)]
*  But anyway, then what do you make of this global response? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1915.4s)]
*  Should also mention that there was no condolence message, no phone call [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1918.32s)]
*  to Netanyahu from Vladimir Putin. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1922.88s)]
*  Yeah. And kind of a neutral statement from his spokesman. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1925.04s)]
*  Yeah. Well, the start on Putin. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1927.4s)]
*  I mean, first of all, Netanyahu spent a lot of years investing [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1929.28s)]
*  in this relationship with Putin, right? Sure did. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1931.76s)]
*  To the point that in one of his campaigns, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1934.36s)]
*  he literally had billboards with him standing by Putin, you know. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1936.92s)]
*  And, you know, what we've learned is [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1941.52s)]
*  Russia is not a friend you can count on, you know. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1944.8s)]
*  And the reality is that Russia stands to gain a lot from this. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1946.8799999999999s)]
*  Like the more part of what I worry about is the more chaotic this is, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1950.24s)]
*  the bigger this war is, the better it is for Russia. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1954.72s)]
*  It just kind of takes the eye off Ukraine. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1957.84s)]
*  The US gets more refocused down in the Middle East [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1960.32s)]
*  and oil prices go up and that enriches him. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1964.96s)]
*  So Putin has every interest to be kind of a chaos agent here. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1967.72s)]
*  You know, that's when people are asking about Iranian [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1971.6s)]
*  support for the attacks that you almost want. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1974.64s)]
*  I mean, the Wagner group, I think, trained some of these Hamas guys, you know. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1976.8s)]
*  So there's some fingerprints. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1981.16s)]
*  I'm not suggesting that they trained the guys literally in this assault, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1984.08s)]
*  but there was a relationship there in the past. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1987.48s)]
*  So, you know, that was ominous from Putin in the sense that, like, [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1990.88s)]
*  he's very close to the Iranians and they might have an interest [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1995.08s)]
*  in stirring up some more shit. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1997.28s)]
*  The Saudi statements have been interesting because in addition to kind of putting [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=1999.64s)]
*  degree of the blame on Israel, they've also clearly put out that like [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2004.32s)]
*  we were trying to tell them in the normalization talks, like, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2007.8s)]
*  you got to focus more on the Palestinians. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2010.96s)]
*  And I don't know whether to believe that or not. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2012.6s)]
*  Like the Saudis have some reason to be spitting that now. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2014.24s)]
*  But if they were saying that, that's interesting. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2016.88s)]
*  And then, I know, I think generally speaking, Europe, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2020.76s)]
*  you know, has lined up as you'd expect behind Israel. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2025.28s)]
*  This weird thing with the aid, which was a manifestation of that, [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2031.52s)]
*  made no sense because the Palestinian Authority had nothing to do [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2035.4s)]
*  with this attack. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2039.92s)]
*  I mean, nobody's saying that. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2041.24s)]
*  And that's who this money goes to. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2042.76s)]
*  It doesn't go to Hamas. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2044.0s)]
*  Some of it, I think, goes to the UN agency that's operating in Gaza. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2045.12s)]
*  Why would you cut those people off now? [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2048.84s)]
*  There's going to be huge humanitarian needs. Right. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2050.48s)]
*  So, you know, that was just the wrong way to express solidarity. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2052.2400000000002s)]
*  It doesn't help Israel to to starve the Palestinian Authority more. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2056.12s)]
*  That's part of the problem here. Right. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2060.04s)]
*  Is it got the Hamas got more empowered relative to them? [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2061.2400000000002s)]
*  So, you know, what will be interesting to see is [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2064.7200000000003s)]
*  in China was, I noticed, studiously neutral and basically said, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2069.28s)]
*  we're not taking a side here. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2072.32s)]
*  What will be interesting to see is if there is a very bloody conflict in Gaza. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2074.32s)]
*  That's when you want to see are there cracks in that European support? [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2078.64s)]
*  Do Russia and China start to try to take more advantage of this [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2083.64s)]
*  in the global south with their message that look at the Americans, their hypocrites, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2086.1600000000003s)]
*  they complain about what Russia is doing in Ukraine. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2089.8s)]
*  And you know, like, you know, the arguments are here. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2093.08s)]
*  And and that and does that kind of inflame Arab opinion a bit now? [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2095.2400000000002s)]
*  You'll hear in the interview, Greg says, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2100.6s)]
*  you know, there's a lot of support for the Palestinians out there, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2103.08s)]
*  but there's also some deep revulsion at the videos of what they've done. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2105.12s)]
*  And and so I think Israel currently has a lot of sympathy. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2109.16s)]
*  But the question is, how durable is that if if things go really badly [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2112.68s)]
*  and from a humanitarian perspective? Yeah. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2118.64s)]
*  I'm also watching kind of how durable the Abraham Accords deals are. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2120.6s)]
*  Right. Like Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan, the UAE. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2125.44s)]
*  Will these Abraham Accord agreements, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2130.48s)]
*  the normalization agreements, endure a really bloody fight in Gaza? [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2132.32s)]
*  I don't think we know. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2135.92s)]
*  No. And you can't I mean, you just can't really argue anymore that those are peace deals, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2137.36s)]
*  you know, because as you reminded, that's not where the conflict is. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2141.6800000000003s)]
*  You know, and so at a minimum, I think it ends the notion that, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2145.1600000000003s)]
*  you know, that that is somehow a substitute for an Israeli Palestinian. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2149.6800000000003s)]
*  The dumbfuck Jared Kushner theory of the case, which was like, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2154.76s)]
*  you get Israel to make peace with all of its neighbors [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2157.6800000000003s)]
*  and then the Palestinian part of it solves itself. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2160.24s)]
*  Yeah. By giving them basically no territory, no peace of Jerusalem [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2162.9199999999996s)]
*  and just screwing them over every way possible. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2166.72s)]
*  No, obviously, that's manifest into a situation like this. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2168.72s)]
*  Yeah, no, they want to move. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2171.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, what's interesting is I saw some Israeli, I think, security voices saying, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2172.2s)]
*  well, maybe Egypt should open up that blockade to allow people out, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2178.08s)]
*  which on the one hand may sound like a humanitarian point, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2183.4799999999996s)]
*  but also maybe, yeah, like that's get, you know, make some make them refugees. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2187.32s)]
*  And I don't know. We'll have to see where it goes. Yeah. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2192.6s)]
*  So we also thought it might be helpful to do a little bit of an explainer [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2195.56s)]
*  among what Hamas is. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2198.76s)]
*  So Hamas, the organization was founded in 1987 by a guy named Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2200.7200000000003s)]
*  who is a Palestinian refugee living in Gaza. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2205.96s)]
*  He'd spent a bunch of time in Israeli prisons. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2208.12s)]
*  Hamas is an acronym for Islamic resistance movement. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2210.52s)]
*  It's an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2213.96s)]
*  but one focused on Palestinian nationalism. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2215.32s)]
*  Its leadership today is fragmented both politically and geographically. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2218.84s)]
*  They've got the militant wing inside Gaza. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2222.88s)]
*  There's this diaspora leadership [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2225.36s)]
*  in Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon and political leaders in Qatar. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2228.2000000000003s)]
*  Their goals are not subtle. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2232.88s)]
*  It's they want to establish an Islamic Palestinian state [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2234.8s)]
*  that includes all of Israel, all of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2238.0800000000004s)]
*  So no coexistence with Israel. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2240.6000000000004s)]
*  The US designated Hamas a terrorist group in 1997. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2242.56s)]
*  The EU and other Western countries have followed suit. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2245.6s)]
*  As we mentioned earlier, Ben, the Hamas won those parliamentary elections [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2248.64s)]
*  in Gaza in 2006, but then they violently took control [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2251.8s)]
*  of the full Gaza Strip in 2007. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2255.24s)]
*  When, by the way, the Bush administration insisted that there be an election. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2257.56s)]
*  Freedom agenda. Yeah. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2260.56s)]
*  Thank you, George W. Bush. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2261.8s)]
*  Yeah, the freedom agenda was Hamas winning a majority of parliamentary seats [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2262.84s)]
*  and then sending armed gunmen to the Fatah, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2266.92s)]
*  their political opponents, headquarters and taking it by force. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2270.3599999999997s)]
*  So you'll often hear, you know, counterterrorism experts [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2274.44s)]
*  talk about the fact that Hamas and Hezbollah in particular [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2277.2s)]
*  have different elements. There's like a political offshoot. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2280.8399999999997s)]
*  There's a militant offshoot in Lebanon. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2283.04s)]
*  There's literally like government ministers and members of parliament [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2284.48s)]
*  who are Hezbollah. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2287.2s)]
*  Hamas provides some limited social services in Gaza as well, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2288.6s)]
*  but they have a very violent militant wing that has conducted [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2291.68s)]
*  suicide bombings, rocket attacks. Now this attack. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2294.8799999999997s)]
*  The State Department estimates that Hamas gets about 70 million a year from Iran. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2297.92s)]
*  Iran also helps them build rockets, drones and plant operations. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2301.48s)]
*  Qatar and Turkey have backed them in the past. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2304.92s)]
*  So, Ben, you know, I think a year or two ago, [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2307.64s)]
*  you probably would have heard people debating whether Hamas was moderating [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2310.48s)]
*  and trying to become more purely political. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2314.64s)]
*  This seems to have put that idea to rest. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2317.1600000000003s)]
*  I think Biden today compared them to ISIS, basically. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2319.64s)]
*  So that's, you know, the status quo. Yeah. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2322.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, on that point, one of the things it's always hard to [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2325.72s)]
*  get your mind around is that, you know, nobody's a monolith right now. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2329.68s)]
*  The Taliban's not. Hamas is not. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2333.3599999999997s)]
*  Now, I think they're all assholes. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2336.08s)]
*  I think everybody in Hamas is an asshole. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2337.4s)]
*  But there there was a political wing and a military wing. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2341.16s)]
*  And I'm sure there are a bunch of people in the political wing [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2344.56s)]
*  who really cared about just being these corrupt, you know, bosses in Gaza, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2348.16s)]
*  had no idea this operation was coming and probably aren't happy about it. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2352.2400000000002s)]
*  And were they going to die? Yeah, because, yeah. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2356.04s)]
*  Actually, some of them already have. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2358.0s)]
*  I saw some of the political leadership has died. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2359.04s)]
*  I've noticed I'm not expressing sympathy for the like. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2361.36s)]
*  I'm just pointing out that this feels like an organization [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2364.92s)]
*  that had some compartmental decision making, you know, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2368.48s)]
*  to plan something like this. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2371.32s)]
*  And so part of the reason why everybody's surprised [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2372.88s)]
*  and this is something else, Greg says, like everybody is looking at this [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2376.92s)]
*  and just shocked that this happened, that they pulled this off and that they did it. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2380.32s)]
*  But that may also be because there was like a particularly militant [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2384.1600000000003s)]
*  nutcase, you know, faction that just decided to do this. You know, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2387.4s)]
*  I think one of the interesting, you know, the Iran point, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2392.6400000000003s)]
*  what it's done over the years is, you know, [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2396.96s)]
*  Iran funds these resistance movements, Hamas and Gaza [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2399.6000000000004s)]
*  and Hezbollah and in Lebanon. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2403.88s)]
*  Obviously, they also backed Assad. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2407.28s)]
*  And what's interesting about that is it's changed the character of Palestinian [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2410.28s)]
*  resistance from a kind of Arab nationalism [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2415.4s)]
*  to a more religious based and Iranian backed thing, you know. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2420.5600000000004s)]
*  And and Greg gets into this a little bit, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2425.6000000000004s)]
*  but that's interesting because in a way [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2429.5600000000004s)]
*  that's also diminished, probably some of the support for Palestinian [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2433.52s)]
*  resistance on kind of what we used to call the Arab street, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2438.08s)]
*  because they are seen as the Hamas and Hezbollah as Iranian backed. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2440.72s)]
*  And right. And even if Hamas is Sunni, not Shia, like that, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2445.64s)]
*  that does color it a little bit. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2449.08s)]
*  And also, like, again, it speaks to like the [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2452.72s)]
*  the reason you should want the Palestinian authority to be stronger, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2456.4s)]
*  because they're not like a religiously based, you know, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2460.92s)]
*  I believe religious fundamentalism tends to lead to bad places. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2464.76s)]
*  And Palestinian authorities, a bunch of, you know, multi sect, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2468.48s)]
*  you know, you got Christians in there and Muslims, too, obviously. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2473.8s)]
*  You've got people that are religious and people aren't at all like I mean, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2476.56s)]
*  unfortunately, like Hamas is ascendance [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2481.2400000000002s)]
*  has kind of radicalized, obviously, [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2485.08s)]
*  the nature of Palestinian resistance and [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2489.12s)]
*  also undermined the kind of more secular, moderate minded potential leadership. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2493.28s)]
*  Yeah. And so, you know, we talked about Iran's sort of historic support for Hamas. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2498.88s)]
*  There's been a lot of confusing reporting about what role [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2503.36s)]
*  Iran may or may not have played in this specific Hamas terrorist attack. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2507.4s)]
*  Here's Tony Blinken, the secretary of state, commenting on it on CNN. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2511.6s)]
*  There's a long relationship between Iran and Hamas. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2515.4s)]
*  In fact, Hamas wouldn't be around in the way that it is without the support [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2517.96s)]
*  that it's received from Iran over the years. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2522.04s)]
*  In this specific instance, we have not yet seen evidence that Iran [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2523.84s)]
*  directed or was behind this particular attack. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2529.08s)]
*  But there's certainly a long relationship. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2531.48s)]
*  So, you know, there are a couple of reports, Wall Street Journal [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2533.68s)]
*  and The Washington Post basically talk to sources within Hamas, [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2535.72s)]
*  maybe sources in Hezbollah, maybe like Western or Middle Eastern [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2539.32s)]
*  security officials who seem to suggest that like there was a big meeting [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2542.64s)]
*  chaired by Iran where they were directing this. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2546.72s)]
*  It sounds like the US government is knocking that down to some extent, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2549.24s)]
*  or maybe we just don't know yet. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2553.16s)]
*  But, you know, if it comes out that Iran was planning, funding, directing this attack, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2554.72s)]
*  that shit gets real scary because I think that Israel will feel the need to respond. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2560.6s)]
*  Yeah, I just don't I don't buy it. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2564.68s)]
*  I mean, it's not in any way excuse Iranians who they fund Hamas. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2567.04s)]
*  That's enough. Like they they do have blood on their hands. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2571.2s)]
*  Absolutely. But the Wall Street Journal report in particular [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2573.9199999999996s)]
*  you know, describe there are two things really jumped out to me. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2578.2400000000002s)]
*  One is describes these meetings is kind of like terrorist super council and Lebanon [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2581.2s)]
*  for something that was so like tightly held. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2587.84s)]
*  I mean, it's hard to have a meeting like that without the US or Israel seeing it. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2590.48s)]
*  That's what I would you know, it just felt like. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2593.68s)]
*  And that, you know, you saw the US and Israel knock it down. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2595.88s)]
*  But then the other thing, there was even a detail in there [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2600.08s)]
*  about like the Iranian foreign minister being in some of these meetings. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2602.8s)]
*  I'm sorry, like everything I've ever learned about the Iranian system, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2606.48s)]
*  including my eight years as an intelligence consumer, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2610.48s)]
*  the foreign minister of Iran is not involved in any of this stuff. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2613.04s)]
*  You know, the IRGC. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2616.24s)]
*  And that's not because he's the foreign minister is a good guy. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2617.56s)]
*  It's because the IRGC people want to own this. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2620.68s)]
*  They don't want the fucking foreign ministry people poking around their accounts. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2622.6s)]
*  You know, so the inclusion of the Iranian foreign minister, it just it felt off to me. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2625.7599999999998s)]
*  Now, again, it doesn't change the fact that they should scrutinize [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2631.04s)]
*  the Iranian role, and and that gets very sensitive, very fast, too, [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2634.84s)]
*  because it does. Israel feel the need to hit Iran, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2638.2400000000002s)]
*  which, again, like triggers a conflict that might burn his blood. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2641.04s)]
*  And suddenly this is a different scale war. Yeah. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2645.0s)]
*  So a couple of quick things, things we didn't get to cover today [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2648.44s)]
*  because we were focused on this. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2651.84s)]
*  There's allegations that Bob Menendez, senator from New Jersey, [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2653.0s)]
*  might have covered up [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2655.92s)]
*  his wife killing someone with her car. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2658.28s)]
*  Very weird story in The New York Times. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2660.7200000000003s)]
*  There's a report that Trump gave nuclear [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2662.2799999999997s)]
*  subsecrets to an Australian guy, Amar Lacko, who then told everyone he knew. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2664.12s)]
*  Niger was finally declared a coup by the United States. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2668.3599999999997s)]
*  A friend of the pod, Bobby Wine, he's a Ugandan opposition leader. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2672.2s)]
*  Multiple time guests on the show was reportedly taken from the airport [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2675.7999999999997s)]
*  in Uganda and put under house arrest. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2679.16s)]
*  All those things we'll try to get to next week. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2681.4799999999996s)]
*  But we did quickly want to talk about this horrible earthquake in Afghanistan. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2683.08s)]
*  Killed an estimated 2500 people [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2688.3199999999997s)]
*  just suffering upon suffering upon suffering for the people of Afghanistan. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2691.52s)]
*  But there is a great aid organization that you can check out if you want to help. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2694.16s)]
*  I asked around for like, what is an organization that, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2697.4399999999996s)]
*  because it's hard with the Taliban there, that that supports [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2700.9199999999996s)]
*  the kind of people that might be doing relief on the ground in Afghanistan. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2704.52s)]
*  And I learned about an organization called Uplift Afghanistan Fund, [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2708.24s)]
*  which enables grassroots organizations, communities in Afghanistan [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2712.6s)]
*  to respond directly to crisis. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2717.2s)]
*  They try to fill gaps, to try to connect people. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2718.68s)]
*  So if people want to support the Afghan people at a rough time, [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2721.48s)]
*  that is www dot uplift Afghanistan dot org. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2726.3199999999997s)]
*  So it's worth checking out. Excellent. Definitely. We'll check that out. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2730.3199999999997s)]
*  OK, we're going to take a quick break. We come back. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2732.3599999999997s)]
*  You'll hear Ben's interview with economist Greg Carlstrom. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2734.48s)]
*  So stick around for that. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2737.3599999999997s)]
*  POTATO, the world is brought to you by Tommy John. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2738.2799999999997s)]
*  It's fall, which means you should be picking apples, not wedgies. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2740.3599999999997s)]
*  Get new underwear. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2744.0s)]
*  They'll take care of your full fruit basket. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2745.04s)]
*  That's Tommy John. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2748.6s)]
*  And you wear Tommy John, you're that much more comfortable. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2749.92s)]
*  Your fruit basket. Get everything better. I did get it. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2752.56s)]
*  Tommy John underwear and loungewear has dozens of comfort innovations. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2755.3199999999997s)]
*  It's breathable, lightweight, moisture wicking fabric with four times [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2758.64s)]
*  the stretch of competing brands that keep you comfortable, [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2762.0s)]
*  no matter what the season throws at you. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2764.56s)]
*  With over 20 million pairs sold and thousands of five star reviews, [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2766.44s)]
*  guys across America love their Tommy Johns because there's no flopping, [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2769.48s)]
*  sticking or chafing. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2773.04s)]
*  That's why Tommy John doesn't have customers. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2775.52s)]
*  They have fanatics, one Tommy John fanatic raves. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2777.08s)]
*  My balls feel amazing. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2780.48s)]
*  The most comfortable boxer briefs ever. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2782.52s)]

*  Do they think that the words flopping, sticking and chafing sell underwear? [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2789.96s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. That's the line. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2793.12s)]

*  Joining us now is the Middle East correspondent for The Economist, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2827.92s)]
*  someone who is always worth listening to on these issues. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2831.7200000000003s)]
*  Greg Carlstrom, thanks so much for joining us here. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2835.92s)]
*  Sure. My pleasure. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2838.2400000000002s)]
*  I wanted to go through the politics of the various different centers here. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2839.0800000000004s)]
*  Israel, the Palestinians, the region. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2844.5600000000004s)]
*  And just kind of get your first impression, [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2848.4s)]
*  recognizing that none of us know exactly what's what's happening now [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2851.1600000000003s)]
*  and what will happen, as you've rightly pointed out. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2854.5200000000004s)]
*  But in Israel, OK, so clearly, [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2858.8s)]
*  you know, Israel's been going through a tumultuous political period. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2862.6400000000003s)]
*  You've covered that the divisions in Israel. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2865.4s)]
*  There's also always, I think, within Israeli society, [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2868.52s)]
*  usually a kind of rally around the flag when threatened. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2871.1600000000003s)]
*  And this is obviously the most acute attack Israel's ever faced. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2874.6800000000003s)]
*  But now we're in this kind of interesting situation [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2878.44s)]
*  where Netanyahu is kind of called for a unity government without preconditions. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2880.2000000000003s)]
*  You've had Bennett and Lapid kind of indicate [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2884.28s)]
*  that they might be open to a unity government, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2887.7200000000003s)]
*  but maybe not with some of the characters who are in it. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2889.2400000000002s)]
*  And you also have some people like Moshe Yalon I saw today, [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2891.76s)]
*  calling for Bibi's resignation over the intelligence failure. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2895.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, what should we be watching? [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2898.32s)]
*  You can predict. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2901.2400000000002s)]
*  But what is important about how this all plays out? [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2902.2000000000003s)]
*  Right. I think in the short term, that rally around the flag effect [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2905.48s)]
*  is going to keep Netanyahu in power for a bit. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2909.48s)]
*  And so the question is really this idea of whether there are preconditions [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2912.2000000000003s)]
*  or not on a unity government. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2916.48s)]
*  Netanyahu wants the centrists, Yair Lapid, Benny Gantz, people like that, [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2918.5600000000004s)]
*  to join his coalition without having to dump the far right ideologues [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2923.7200000000003s)]
*  who are also in that coalition. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2928.1600000000003s)]
*  That makes sense for Netanyahu in a very cynical political way, [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2930.4s)]
*  because this is a prime minister who's always concerned about his political future. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2933.92s)]
*  He has an eye on, you know, when the war is over, when the dust settles, [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2938.28s)]
*  there's going to be an inevitable early election [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2941.8s)]
*  if I cut ties with my far right coalition partners. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2944.1600000000003s)]
*  So he doesn't want to do that. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2946.96s)]
*  He wants to be able to keep his grip on power. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2948.96s)]
*  On the other side for Lapid to join this government [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2951.96s)]
*  with the likes of Ben Gver and Smotrich and these sorts of people, [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2954.92s)]
*  he would be legitimizing a government that he and his supporters [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2959.08s)]
*  have been protesting against all year. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2961.96s)]
*  On the other hand, if he doesn't join, the rhetoric is going to be, well, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2964.48s)]
*  you know, look, the center left doesn't want Israeli unity. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2968.56s)]
*  They're playing politics at a time of war. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2971.2s)]
*  So this is meant as a poison pill. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2973.52s)]
*  When Netanyahu says join with no preconditions, [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2975.6s)]
*  he means this to be a poison pill for people like Lapid. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2977.8s)]
*  You have no good options here either. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2981.12s)]
*  You can join this coalition, legitimize it, [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2982.4s)]
*  probably have not much say over government policy, or you can stay out. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2984.92s)]
*  And then I can beat up on you for staying out. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2988.8399999999997s)]
*  It puts him in a very difficult position. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2991.16s)]
*  Having covered this, you know, part of what was so striking [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2992.96s)]
*  in the recent judicial episode is that you had senior figures [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=2997.2s)]
*  from the military or ex-military and intelligence [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3002.52s)]
*  really out of step with Bibi. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3006.52s)]
*  Is that something, you know, there's a rally around the flag [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3009.44s)]
*  thing happening now, of course, but should should be we watching [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3013.28s)]
*  the kind of civil military relations in Israel, given how kind of toxic [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3017.6s)]
*  some of that seemed to get as this plays out and some very hard [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3021.8s)]
*  decisions have to be made? [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3025.52s)]
*  You know, it's interesting, if you look at Bibi's career, [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3026.76s)]
*  you can say it's been very striking over the past year [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3029.52s)]
*  how the military and the security services seem to break with him. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3032.56s)]
*  But if you go through a list, actually, of the former army chiefs [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3035.56s)]
*  or Mossad directors who served under Netanyahu, it's remarkable [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3039.24s)]
*  how many of them wind up being really vocal critics of the prime minister. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3043.3199999999997s)]
*  He falls out with all of his security chiefs, because basically [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3048.0s)]
*  when things are going well, he takes credit and things are going badly. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3050.6s)]
*  He blames it on the army. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3054.16s)]
*  He blames it on the intelligence services. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3055.24s)]
*  He's trying to do that now. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3057.64s)]
*  But I think it's not going to work as well now, because this is the most [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3059.9599999999996s)]
*  spectacular security failure in Israel's history. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3063.3999999999996s)]
*  Do I think we're going to get to a point where there's a complete [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3067.12s)]
*  breakdown in civil military relations? [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3069.7999999999997s)]
*  No, I don't think we're going to get there. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3071.7599999999998s)]
*  I think what's going to happen is for a lot of Israelis, this is just [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3073.7999999999997s)]
*  going to bring them back to, I mean, at the end of the day, the most trusted, [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3077.0s)]
*  the most credible entity for most people in Israel is the army. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3080.8399999999997s)]
*  This is something that so many Israelis serve in. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3084.96s)]
*  It's something that so many Israelis respect. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3087.04s)]
*  Obviously, there are some questions now about what seems like a very bungled [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3089.36s)]
*  handling of Gaza and of the tactical response on Saturday. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3092.88s)]
*  But I think Netanyahu trying to shift the blame to the security services [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3097.36s)]
*  isn't going to quite work in this case. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3101.2000000000003s)]
*  I think people are going to hold him personally responsible for this. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3102.84s)]
*  Yeah, no, that'll be really interesting to watch as this transpires. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3106.0s)]
*  Well, looking at the Palestinians, [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3110.32s)]
*  you know, it felt to me like the Palestinian authority was weaker [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3113.2000000000003s)]
*  than it ever had been before this took place. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3117.36s)]
*  You know, no progress in Palestinian statehood, [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3119.6s)]
*  kind of this corrupt elderly, sclerotic leadership in Ramallah [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3124.2s)]
*  that felt totally out of touch with everything. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3128.56s)]
*  Now Hamas has cast the die here, but it's also, I think, going to be, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3130.72s)]
*  you know, pretty relentlessly pursued, if not dismantled by Israel. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3136.12s)]
*  What what what do you look for in terms of this vacuum [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3141.64s)]
*  in the Palestinian leadership? [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3146.44s)]
*  Is is there just no other alternative than the PA? [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3147.8s)]
*  Could something else emerge? [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3152.1200000000003s)]
*  Did Hamas succeed in putting itself at kind of the vanguard of the Palestinians? [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3153.88s)]
*  I mean, how do you assess what we should be watching there? [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3158.1600000000003s)]
*  There is no alternative. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3160.7200000000003s)]
*  And that's that's partly due to choices that the Israeli government has made [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3161.92s)]
*  over the past decade and a half. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3165.84s)]
*  I mean, the big question now for the Israeli government, [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3167.28s)]
*  for the Israeli army, as they're talking about whether to do a ground [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3171.1200000000003s)]
*  invasion of Gaza is what then? [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3174.44s)]
*  Even if you go in and manage to uproot Hamas, what happens after that? [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3177.6s)]
*  The Palestinian Authority, I think, is entirely too weak to come in [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3181.92s)]
*  and exert any kind of control there. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3185.0s)]
*  I mean, if you look at polls of what Palestinians think, [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3186.84s)]
*  a plurality of Palestinians and a majority of Palestinians in Gaza [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3190.08s)]
*  want to dismantle the PA because they think it is nothing more [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3194.76s)]
*  than it's a vehicle for corruption and it's a subcontractor [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3197.7200000000003s)]
*  for the Israeli occupation. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3201.52s)]
*  So it has no popular legitimacy anymore. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3202.84s)]
*  So I don't see any scenario where it can come in and take over. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3205.6s)]
*  And this is what is, I think, especially grim about this moment is [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3208.56s)]
*  part of the reason it's so weak is because it's it's shot through with corruption [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3213.52s)]
*  and it's entirely its own fault. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3216.68s)]
*  But part of the reason also is Netanyahu has had a very clear policy [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3218.52s)]
*  as prime minister over the past decade and a half of trying to, [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3222.64s)]
*  on the one hand, weaken the PA, refusing any kind of negotiations [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3225.8399999999997s)]
*  about a two state solution, imposing economic sanctions on the PA, [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3229.7599999999998s)]
*  for example, when they wanted to join the International Criminal Court, [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3233.84s)]
*  imposing sanctions on them. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3237.32s)]
*  So he's tried to weaken the more moderate Palestinian body. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3239.0s)]
*  At the same time, he has boosted Hamas because he treats it [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3242.7200000000003s)]
*  as a negotiating partner. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3246.1600000000003s)]
*  They talk about prisoner swaps in 2011 for Gilad Shalit. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3248.2000000000003s)]
*  They've talked about various ways to ease slightly the blockade on Gaza. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3252.6400000000003s)]
*  He's willing to negotiate with Hamas in a way that he's not with the PA. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3257.8s)]
*  And so what message does this send? [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3261.88s)]
*  Broadly, this sends a message that if you are moderate and open [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3263.64s)]
*  to negotiations, you get nothing. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3266.52s)]
*  And if you are militant and willing to every couple of years [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3268.44s)]
*  fire a lot of rockets at Israel, we talk to you like you're a legitimate sovereign. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3270.96s)]
*  And so, again, some of this is the Palestinians own fault, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3275.2000000000003s)]
*  but some of this goes back to Israeli policy under Netanyahu. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3278.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, no, I mean, I want to get to the region in a second here. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3281.48s)]
*  But one of the many tragedies that I see here, right, is that [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3283.92s)]
*  however big this war gets and it could get much bigger, [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3288.28s)]
*  on the back end of it, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3292.36s)]
*  there's still going to be millions of Palestinians living in Gaza and the West Bank. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3296.28s)]
*  There's and there's no like the absent people coming in to just building [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3302.56s)]
*  an entirely new Palestinian leadership and having a totally different [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3307.7200000000003s)]
*  mindset in the Israeli government about a two state solution. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3310.64s)]
*  It's hard to see any pathway to some kind of political process [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3314.28s)]
*  that they can lead anywhere. Right. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3319.72s)]
*  I mean, it would have to kind of start from scratch, essentially. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3321.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, it almost does at this point. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3325.2799999999997s)]
*  You know, this is there haven't been elections in Palestine since 2006 [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3327.7599999999998s)]
*  was the last parliamentary election, 2005 was the last presidential election. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3332.64s)]
*  The median age for Palestinians is about 18. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3337.0s)]
*  So that means the last time they had a chance to elect their government, [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3339.7599999999998s)]
*  most Palestinians weren't even born yet at that point. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3342.9599999999996s)]
*  And they're saddled with this leadership that on both sides. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3345.72s)]
*  Abu Mazen in Ramallah does not want to hold new elections [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3349.28s)]
*  because he's worried about losing. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3352.8s)]
*  But equally, Hamas in Gaza at various points has not wanted to hold elections [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3354.12s)]
*  because they don't want to lose their grip on on what they control in Gaza. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3358.12s)]
*  So you have the situation where there's no chance through elections [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3364.2s)]
*  to change your leaders. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3367.44s)]
*  And there's also an entire generation of old men in the Palestinian leadership [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3368.4s)]
*  who don't want to give up their grip on power. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3374.2400000000002s)]
*  Abbas is 87. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3377.0800000000004s)]
*  He's probably going to die in the next few years, but he will give way to one [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3378.44s)]
*  or several potential successors who are old, who come from an older generation, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3383.2400000000002s)]
*  who don't represent what is a very young population. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3388.5200000000004s)]
*  You talk to a lot of young Palestinians and they say, [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3391.4s)]
*  we're basically just waiting for all of these people to die off, [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3393.32s)]
*  because until they do, there is absolutely no chance of having any kind [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3395.92s)]
*  of different political approach here. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3399.48s)]
*  Yeah, well, so that to step back to the region, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3401.5200000000004s)]
*  you know, part of what's happened in recent years and we've been, [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3405.92s)]
*  you know, critics of them on this podcast, but you had the Abraham Accords, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3410.36s)]
*  these normalization deals with Arab autocrats kind of cast as peace agreements, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3415.4s)]
*  even though they're with governments that Israel wasn't at war with. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3421.0s)]
*  But essentially, the idea is that you could ignore the Palestinians, [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3424.64s)]
*  essentially cut some deals with these guys. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3428.08s)]
*  Maybe they could sprinkle some money around the West Bank. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3430.6s)]
*  They'd probably line the pockets of the PA anyway and call it a day. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3433.12s)]
*  Right. And the big, you know, white whale of that process was Saudi Arabia. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3436.56s)]
*  It felt like that those talks were ripening. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3441.7599999999998s)]
*  What does this do to the Saudi deal? [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3445.3599999999997s)]
*  And also, what does it do to the whole concept? [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3450.2s)]
*  I mean, that is selling these agreements as peace agreements [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3453.08s)]
*  and as a resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3456.88s)]
*  I mean, near term Saudi deal, but also just stepping back. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3460.36s)]
*  Like, what do you think this does to the Abraham Accords? [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3463.92s)]
*  On a Saudi deal, I don't think it completely forecloses making a deal, [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3466.36s)]
*  but I think it kicks it off a ways down the road. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3470.84s)]
*  I mean, the line that you always heard from Washington throughout this year [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3473.96s)]
*  was that if America doesn't get this done by the end of 2023, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3478.08s)]
*  it's not getting done under Biden's first term because 2024, [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3481.92s)]
*  Washington is consumed with elections. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3485.8s)]
*  It's not the time where a big foreign policy initiative is going to get done. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3487.96s)]
*  So I think what happens now is, you know, we're in October 2023. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3492.04s)]
*  Israel is about to embark on a large scale military offensive in Gaza. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3495.52s)]
*  The scenes of devastation that we're all expecting, sadly, from Gaza, [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3500.96s)]
*  are not going to be the backdrop for Saudi Arabia to normalize with Israel. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3506.0800000000004s)]
*  So this gets delayed indefinitely. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3510.04s)]
*  Then we're into 2024. We're into election season. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3512.52s)]
*  I think this is something that gets kicked down the road a ways. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3515.56s)]
*  On the bigger question of what this means for the concept, [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3519.48s)]
*  I mean, there are two ways that people talked about the Abraham Accords, right? [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3523.0s)]
*  There was the what I think was spin from countries in the Gulf [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3526.64s)]
*  and from some people in America who said, you know, this can be good [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3530.88s)]
*  not just for Israel, but for the Palestinians as well, [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3533.84s)]
*  because it will give Arab governments leverage over Israeli policy. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3537.04s)]
*  We have clearly seen that not to be the case over the past few years. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3542.28s)]
*  I mean, you've had a hard right government in Israel for the past year [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3545.92s)]
*  and no one in the Arab world has had any leverage over it. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3549.48s)]
*  The other thing that people said about the Abraham Accords, [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3552.64s)]
*  I think the more realistic way of looking at the Accords was [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3554.6s)]
*  this is a security pact between countries that have a similar worldview, [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3557.76s)]
*  that are worried about Iran and want to form some kind of alliance against Iran. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3561.8s)]
*  But I think what's quite striking now is, you know, we have a conflict [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3566.64s)]
*  between Israel and Hamas, which received support from Iran. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3571.04s)]
*  There are growing concerns about escalation in Lebanon, [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3575.12s)]
*  where Hezbollah is, of course, backed by Iran. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3578.2799999999997s)]
*  This could bring in Iranian proxies across the region. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3581.7599999999998s)]
*  And you don't see any security coordination between Israel [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3584.84s)]
*  and its Abraham Accords partners. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3587.72s)]
*  So I think what's happened over the past few days is also exposed [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3589.12s)]
*  the fiction that this was a viable security alliance. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3593.36s)]
*  And I think that's the really unfortunate thing about it. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3596.96s)]
*  It hasn't helped the Palestinians. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3599.4s)]
*  It also hasn't created a real security architecture in the region [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3600.84s)]
*  that might be useful at a time like this. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3603.8s)]
*  Yeah. Do you see what is the reaction? [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3606.2400000000002s)]
*  There's been so much understandable focus on, [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3609.6400000000003s)]
*  obviously, the horrific violence against Israelis and the fate of Palestinians in Gaza. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3612.6800000000003s)]
*  What do you sense the reaction is in the broader Arab world, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3618.52s)]
*  in the Middle East there, both among kind of [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3623.4s)]
*  Is there a sense of solidarity with Palestinians? [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3627.2799999999997s)]
*  Are the leaders uneasy about this? [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3630.3199999999997s)]
*  Or should we be watching for, you know, [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3632.52s)]
*  protests in places like Egypt and Jordan? [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3635.52s)]
*  Or is that just kind of not happening? [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3639.3199999999997s)]
*  I feel like this is something that hasn't gotten a lot of attention yet. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3640.56s)]
*  And it's a hard thing to, you know, I'll caveat it by saying [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3643.4s)]
*  it's a very hard thing to [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3645.8799999999997s)]
*  capture public opinion of hundreds of millions of people [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3649.12s)]
*  in more than a dozen countries. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3651.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, we tried a lot in the Obama years. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3653.44s)]
*  And with mixed results. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3655.56s)]
*  I'm sure. Yeah. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3658.04s)]
*  But I will say just from talking to people over the past few days, [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3659.84s)]
*  from from watching Arab media, from looking at what's on social media, [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3663.16s)]
*  I do feel like there's a slightly different conversation than there was, say, in 2014. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3667.56s)]
*  The last time there was a really big war between Israel and Hamas, [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3673.48s)]
*  the war that went on for about seven weeks that summer. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3676.7999999999997s)]
*  You know, one thing I would say is, of course, [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3680.4s)]
*  the majority of people in the Arab world are still [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3682.64s)]
*  deeply sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3686.12s)]
*  maybe are not cheering what happened in Israel, but are [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3690.56s)]
*  are glad to see Israel humiliated in a way that hasn't happened since 1973. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3693.96s)]
*  At the same time, though, that was maybe the initial reaction on Saturday morning. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3700.72s)]
*  As the images and videos started to emerge of, you know, [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3704.8399999999997s)]
*  bodies piled up in bus stations and hundreds of people killed at a music festival [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3709.56s)]
*  and grandmothers being abducted and brought across the border into Gaza. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3714.52s)]
*  There was some change in the way people in the region were talking about it. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3719.96s)]
*  And I think people, even people who are sympathetic to the Palestinians, [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3723.44s)]
*  were horrified by the level of violence and the level of brutality. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3726.56s)]
*  And I think that changed the conversation around this a little bit. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3731.32s)]
*  I think another thing that's different is, you know, as someone put it to me yesterday, [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3734.56s)]
*  there's a feeling that supporting the Palestinian cause, [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3739.7599999999998s)]
*  as he said, it's no longer an Arab cause, it's an Iranian cause, [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3744.48s)]
*  because the groups that are fighting on behalf of Palestinians [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3747.88s)]
*  are Iranian backed groups, again, Hamas, Hezbollah, groups like that. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3751.64s)]
*  And I think in a region where Iran has become so polarizing, [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3757.08s)]
*  where Syrians, for example, you know, spent the last decade [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3759.6s)]
*  suffering as a result of the Revolutionary Guard and Iranian backed militias, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3762.92s)]
*  that has shifted the way people look at the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as well. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3767.68s)]
*  So, you know, again, I don't want to say anything definitive or quantitative, [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3772.4s)]
*  but it does feel to me as someone who's covered the region for a while, [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3776.92s)]
*  it does feel to me like there's a bit of a difference [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3780.24s)]
*  in the way people are talking now than a decade ago. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3782.4s)]
*  That's really interesting. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3784.64s)]
*  And obviously, with all the this could change, [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3785.64s)]
*  as if the violence against the Palestinians is as horrific as I fear it may be. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3787.96s)]
*  But that's a really interesting point, because essentially, [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3793.6s)]
*  even all the escalation risk in the near term feels like it's Hezbollah [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3796.28s)]
*  and southern Lebanon, maybe Iran, not, you know, [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3800.36s)]
*  you know, I saw the Emiratis warned Syria, [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3806.96s)]
*  although I'm not quite sure why Assad would would get involved. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3811.52s)]
*  But it is like along that axis of Iranian backed resistance groups. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3813.92s)]
*  I did want to just ask you, I mean, look, this region is [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3819.88s)]
*  as one final question here, I, you know, I [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3823.84s)]
*  the darkest, you know, parts of my government service were [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3828.6400000000003s)]
*  interacting with this region, sometimes interacting with this particular conflict [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3832.84s)]
*  between Israelis and Palestinians. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3836.7200000000003s)]
*  It's hard not to become incredibly cynical [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3839.08s)]
*  when when you watch the way that power is exercised in this region. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3842.56s)]
*  Language kind of gets stripped of its meaning. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3847.7200000000003s)]
*  There are these formulations to state solution this or deeply concerned about that, [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3849.84s)]
*  that that feel totally inauthentic. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3855.88s)]
*  And yet this event is is [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3859.92s)]
*  is so big. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3864.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm just wondering how how you as someone who kind of lives in [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3866.08s)]
*  and follows this this part of the world, [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3869.1600000000003s)]
*  do you feel like you're even able to absorb it? [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3873.0s)]
*  I mean, what has just been your personal reaction to [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3875.04s)]
*  to seeing a conflict that we all knew, you know, could blow up, [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3878.72s)]
*  but maybe still seeing it blow up is is hard for us to get our heads around. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3881.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean, how are you just processing this? [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3886.48s)]
*  It's I think people use the word unprecedented a lot, [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3888.04s)]
*  but this really is unprecedented. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3891.3599999999997s)]
*  You know, waking up on Saturday morning to not just the reports of thousands of rockets fired [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3894.48s)]
*  in one morning, but, you know, these fragmentary reports in the early hours of this, [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3900.0s)]
*  that militants had crossed the border and taken over various towns in Israel. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3904.96s)]
*  This is something, you know, as a journalist who's been in the region for a decade and a half, [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3909.2000000000003s)]
*  who lived in Israel for years, not something I ever would have imagined. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3913.44s)]
*  And the three and a half days since then have just been this constant struggle to try and figure out [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3917.84s)]
*  what is going on, why it's going on. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3923.44s)]
*  And no one has an answer. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3925.8s)]
*  You know, speaking with we've talked with, for example, [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3926.88s)]
*  various Hamas officials over the past few days, [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3930.04s)]
*  trying to get a sense of what the strategy was here. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3933.72s)]
*  What did you hope to achieve by doing this? [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3937.68s)]
*  And you don't really get a good answer to that. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3940.64s)]
*  And it makes you wonder, was this the term catastrophic success, [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3942.12s)]
*  something that worked better than you intended and ends up having very negative consequences? [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3946.3599999999997s)]
*  You wonder if even they expected that the results of this were going to be as bloody and as gruesome as they were. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3951.92s)]
*  Then you talk to Israeli officials in the days since and you ask them, [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3959.2799999999997s)]
*  it looks like there's a buildup for a ground invasion in Gaza. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3963.4799999999996s)]
*  You've mobilized 300,000 reservists. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3966.64s)]
*  You're moving all sorts of military kit to the border. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3968.7599999999998s)]
*  But what's your plan? [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3971.4399999999996s)]
*  You know, that old David Petraeus line from the Iraq War, tell me how this ends. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3973.0s)]
*  Tell me how this ends. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3976.8799999999997s)]
*  What are you trying to accomplish in Gaza? [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3977.72s)]
*  And they don't know. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3979.56s)]
*  So there's this feeling that aside from the immediate human catastrophe, [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3980.52s)]
*  first in Israel and then in Gaza that we've seen over the past three and a half days, [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3986.3199999999997s)]
*  there's just this very ominous feeling of no one knows where this goes. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3990.72s)]
*  And you feel like there's often a predictable, a very sad, but very predictable script in this region. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=3994.3199999999997s)]
*  We've thrown that script out the window now and I don't know where any of this is going and no one knows where this is going. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=4000.2799999999997s)]
*  No, I think that's a very good note to end on. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=4005.8799999999997s)]
*  That's very well said because there's just something ominous about this. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=4007.7999999999997s)]
*  And there's so many ways that this can escalate beyond what we can even think of. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=4012.96s)]
*  I think about the holy sites. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=4018.7599999999998s)]
*  I think about the West Bank. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=4020.68s)]
*  I think about just all manner of scenarios beyond just the obvious Iranian ones. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=4022.24s)]
*  And the only thing you're sure of is that innocent people are going to die, Israelis and Palestinians. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=4030.9199999999996s)]
*  And that's what makes it feel so bad. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=4037.8399999999997s)]
*  That leadership, in this case, obviously Hamas is one that had the catastrophic success, [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=4042.8s)]
*  but no secret to people, I'm no fan of BBs. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=4047.96s)]
*  But ultimately, it matters. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=4050.28s)]
*  Well, look, I really appreciate you helping us sort through some of this. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=4053.32s)]
*  People should follow your work on Twitter and The Economist, [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=4060.5600000000004s)]
*  really one of the sharpest eyes on this part of the world. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=4064.88s)]
*  So thanks for helping us sort through this a bit. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=4068.6800000000003s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=4070.96s)]
*  Thanks again to Greg for joining the show. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=4072.0s)]
*  And thanks again to everyone who helped us sketch out and produce [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=4074.28s)]
*  and then also listen to the bonus episode we did on Saturday. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=4079.08s)]
*  We are going to try to decide later this week if we should do another update, [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=4082.8s)]
*  but events will kind of dictate. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=4087.08s)]
*  Yeah, no, we'll see. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=4088.84s)]
*  We will if we need to. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=4090.52s)]
*  But yeah, many thanks to the people that can somehow pull this together [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=4092.12s)]
*  on a moment's notice on a Saturday. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=4097.12s)]
*  Yeah, thanks for our amazing team. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=4098.400000000001s)]
*  Speaks to how good our team is. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=4099.64s)]
*  Yeah, you're a quick media for everyone working on the Saturday [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=4100.36s)]
*  and working on the Monday after the day off. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=4102.639999999999s)]
*  So thanks again, everybody, and talk to you soon. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO4kc15DHA&t=4104.44s)]
