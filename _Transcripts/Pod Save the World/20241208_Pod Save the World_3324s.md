# BREAKING: Assad Regime Collapses in Syria
**Pod Save the World:** [December 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA)
*  Welcome back to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Ben Rhodes. We are recording a bonus episode today [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=0.0s)]
*  Because of the truly historic events happening as we speak in syria, Ben [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=6.24s)]
*  Is this the is this the best news bonus we've ever done? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=10.96s)]
*  I've been waiting to record this bonus episode for over a decade tommy. So yeah, I think so. Yeah [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=14.64s)]
*  It's really good to see a guy like asad go down [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  So russian state media is now reporting that Bashar al-assad has escaped from syria and is in moscow with his family [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=22.16s)]
*  Rebel factions have captured basically all the territory that was held by the asad regime just a few weeks ago [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=29.44s)]
*  The free syrian army is flying over damascus as we speak [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=34.96s)]
*  It it essentially took less than two weeks around eight days [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  I think from the start of this offensive by members of this opposition group hts and the free syrian army [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=41.68s)]
*  To sweep down from northwest syria and eventually take the capital [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=47.2s)]
*  Uh incredibly they seem to have done so without really [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=51.36s)]
*  Encountering much if any resistance. I think these syrian soldiers underpaid [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=54.16s)]
*  Demoralized exhausted by 13 years of civil war mostly just chose not to fight [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=58.94s)]
*  There's these pictures all over social media of army uniforms just littering the streets because these guys stripped them off and ran away [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=63.44s)]
*  Um on top of that syria's benefactors the russians iranians hesbullah were too damaged and distracted by other wars to come to their aid [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=70.88s)]
*  Uh, and as hts in the free syrian army swept down from the north towards damascus other opposition groups saw their moment here [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=78.72s)]
*  Uh some in southern syria started taking territory the kurds took some territory in northeast syria [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=87.11999999999999s)]
*  And the net effect is that these groups just ended [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  50 years of brutal asad family rule in syria [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=96.0s)]
*  And they close at least this chapter of syria's 13 year civil war [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=100.64s)]
*  Where bashar al-assad killed hundreds of thousands of his own people you'll see estimates ranging from 300 000 to 600 000 [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=105.52s)]
*  He imprisoned and tortured countless more [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  Um, there's amazing footage ben on social media today of those prisons being liberated [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=115.44000000000001s)]
*  um one that it really stuck with me is there was a footage of a women's prison being liberated and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=120.56s)]
*  A woman came out of a cell and there was clearly just a small child like a little boy who had been living there with her [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=128.08s)]
*  Unbelievable just horrifying. Um, the the prime minister, uh asad's prime minister, I guess drew the short straw here [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=134.62s)]
*  Or maybe he just didn't make the plane manifest. He said he's gonna stay in syria [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  To manage the transition to whatever, uh, whoever takes power next so a lot to cover here [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=145.12s)]
*  But ben, I just want to start like initial reactions to this unbelievable two weeks of events [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=151.68s)]
*  I think it's almost hard to put into words how many lives, uh, this conflict has touched particularly obviously syrian lives [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  Um, you think of all those people who died [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=164.23999999999998s)]
*  you think of all the refugees the millions of people I mean tommy one of the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=167.04s)]
*  More powerful images I saw is basically like a traffic jam [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=171.84s)]
*  uh, you know of people coming back to syria from [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=176.23999999999998s)]
*  Uh turkey which obviously runs completely counter to what we're accustomed to images of people leaving [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  Um, I think of all the people I know who? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=185.92s)]
*  Have been touched by this, you know war syrians. I've met over the years aid workers [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  People who worked with refugees people living on the turkish border people living in jordan. I mean [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=193.92s)]
*  At a time when there's so much [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=198.88s)]
*  darkness and despair in the world too, uh [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=200.72s)]
*  to all of a sudden have this [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=204.0s)]
*  Cathartic collapse of this regime and we can get into kind of why that happened [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=206.29999999999998s)]
*  Uh, it just reminds you that things can turn on a dime and that you never know [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=212.39999999999998s)]
*  Um when we were in office, you know, we're constantly [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=216.72s)]
*  Looking at intelligence assessments and regime morale morale and defections and territorial holdings and trying to figure out the day when asad might go [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=220.16s)]
*  Um, so amazing that after such a grinding civil war for so long that it just happened so fast [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=229.68s)]
*  And and the last thing I just said as uh to start here [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=235.36s)]
*  um [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=238.88s)]
*  What's also so remarkable? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=240.08s)]
*  And heartening is that this was clearly done by syrians, you know for for all the debates about whether the u.s [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=242.8s)]
*  Should have intervened more or what? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  Countries in the region, you know what proxies they were backing [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=250.96s)]
*  you know [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  Whether it's turkey or qatar or other gulf states or whomever at the end of the day [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=255.52s)]
*  this was syrians who organize themselves and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=260.56s)]
*  Seize this moment to bring an end to a really [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=264.48s)]
*  corrupt awful tyrannical rule and [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=269.1s)]
*  And I think we just have to kind of inhabit that as as a hopeful moment [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=272.32s)]
*  It doesn't diminish the amount of challenges that exist for syria for the middle east for u.s [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=275.6s)]
*  Farm policy which we'll get into but but today is a hopeful day and at a time when you don't get a lot of those [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=280.24s)]
*  Yeah, I mean god knows what will come next [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=286.64s)]
*  Um, I don't think any of us are you and I live through the arab spring. We are not [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=289.2s)]
*  Sanguine, uh about you know how these things go. I mean the civil war could continue there could be more chapters [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=293.18s)]
*  It could get bloodier. You could see the rise of um [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=298.72s)]
*  A pretty unsavory set of leaders in syria, but I do think it's worth taking a moment and just [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=302.48s)]
*  Celebrating that bashar al-assad one of the most evil men in modern history an absolute butcher [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=309.58s)]
*  Who just massacred his own people without any concern for it over the course of a decade is gone [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=316.96s)]
*  And a friend of the pod max said and ben tweeted a link to an article from 2014 [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=323.03999999999996s)]
*  Where uh assad said tell vladimir vladimir vich putin that i'm not yanukovych. I won't go anywhere [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=329.12s)]
*  This was him peacocking and bragging about how he would never leave his country the way [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=334.71999999999997s)]
*  Then the leader of ukraine did so, you know life comes at you fast [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=339.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean just to put a fine point on the dictatorship of it all [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=344.15999999999997s)]
*  You do get a sense of the difference between total dictatorship and and the alternative when you just see people [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=348.32s)]
*  Almost shocked being able to do normal things like walk out of their houses [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=355.12s)]
*  Uh, like travel back to their homes that they've been exiled from in some cases more than a decade [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=359.76s)]
*  uh to kind of just you know, it there's a reason it's a cliche to kind of breathe free air after [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=366.24s)]
*  um [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=372.32s)]
*  That physical space was closed to them. I will say to max's point now that [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=373.28000000000003s)]
*  Russia's in the business of accepting syrian refugees with their first refugee family the assads [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=378.48s)]
*  um [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=383.36s)]
*  A bit of extra justice too that uh, it's moskow winter [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=384.56s)]
*  so he's going from the lavant one of the most beautiful places in the world to uh, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=387.84s)]
*  You know grim grim circumstances in moskow right now. I imagine in december [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=392.0s)]
*  I uh, I hope it's awful. I hope his apartment is shitty and uh that he lives a very short life [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=396.0s)]
*  So, uh, let's talk about how we got here ben [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=401.04s)]
*  So, you know as we mentioned at the top assad's out, uh [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=402.88s)]
*  Allies have historically been the russians the iranians and then a bunch of shia [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=406.24s)]
*  Led militia groups and proxy groups, especially hasbullah asad is an alawite [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=410.08000000000004s)]
*  Which is a branch of shia islam, which is why he aligns with iran and some of these other groups [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=414.16s)]
*  Um after the syrian regime the assad regime [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=418.88s)]
*  Faced this existential threat to its existence after the start of the arab spring the iranians helped [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=422.56s)]
*  Assad with direct military support. They brought in various militia groups to fight on his behalf including [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=429.52000000000004s)]
*  Uh hasbullah including I mean they they literally were recruiting afghan refugees and paying them to go live and fight in syria on behalf of assad [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=436.32s)]
*  um [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=445.12s)]
*  And then you know reportedly qasem solomani the former head of iran's islamic revolutionary guard corps or irgc [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=446.24s)]
*  He apparently went to russia himself to personally convince putin to directly intervene [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=452.48s)]
*  On assad's behalf in 2015 which led to the russians beginning, you know, two years basically of grueling [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=458.64s)]
*  Brutal airstrikes on the syrian opposition with total disregard for civilian casualties [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=465.84000000000003s)]
*  Um, but you know this time the russians as we've discussed their military has been chewed up in ukraine [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=471.92s)]
*  Uh, they're down a lot of men and a lot of uh kit and a lot of money [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=478.64000000000004s)]
*  Um hasbullah had its leadership decapitated by the israelis [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=482.72s)]
*  Iran started pulling the ripcord on assad last week and started pulling out military and diplomatic staff [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=486.72s)]
*  Uh, the new york times reported that I think they were talking to some irgc sources who said look we saw that assad's forces were [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=492.15999999999997s)]
*  Not going to fight for themselves. So how do we advise them? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=498.4s)]
*  How do we even help them when these guys are stripping off their uniforms and running away? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=501.52s)]
*  um [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=505.2s)]
*  And then I think it also really has to be [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=506.08s)]
*  Emphasized that the syrian regime was not legitimate. It was a corrupt hollowed out kleptocracy [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=509.2s)]
*  His the the these fighters were exhausted and underpaid and unwilling to die for assad, especially the sunni ones [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=516.02s)]
*  Uh, it wasn't all alawites in the army. There's a lot of sort of like sunni [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=522.5799999999999s)]
*  You know grunts and then diplomatically, you know [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=526.66s)]
*  You'll read all these reports that assad has just managed to piss off all of his friends recently like the uae the emirates [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=529.8599999999999s)]
*  Had undertaken this effort to rehabilitate him. They tried to bring him back to the arab league [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=534.8199999999999s)]
*  They did bring him back to the arab league. They wanted to get the world to recognize assad again [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=538.3399999999999s)]
*  But I guess assad just has been unwilling to give an inch in diplomatic negotiations, especially with erdogan prime minister erdogan of turkey [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=541.38s)]
*  Who uh, I think erdogan primarily wants to form a buffer zone between turkey and syria [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=549.86s)]
*  To keep out the kurdish forces that he views as a threat [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=555.9399999999999s)]
*  Uh, and assad wouldn't give him what he wanted and pissing erdogan off seems to have been a huge mistake as it made erdogan [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=559.14s)]
*  more and more committed to [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=565.22s)]
*  Providing support to hts this rebel group that just stormed down to damascus [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=566.9s)]
*  So ben, what are your thoughts on kind of like the biggest factors? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=571.86s)]
*  That led to this moment because I think two three four weeks ago like 95 percent of analysts [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=575.78s)]
*  Would have said this moment would probably never have happened [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=581.54s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I always [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=585.06s)]
*  I I thought someday this would happen just because assad is a corrupt [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=587.38s)]
*  um kleptocrat without uh support from the people but I [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=592.4s)]
*  Did not see it coming anywhere near this soon [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=597.3s)]
*  Um, nor could I have forecasted when there are two factors i'd point to [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=599.9399999999999s)]
*  First we talked about uh the distraction, you know, russia is focused on ukraine [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=604.98s)]
*  The iranians, uh are focused on their own internal stability his blow has been decimated, uh through the war with israel [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=610.42s)]
*  There's a practical piece to that just that they're less personnel [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=619.14s)]
*  I mean the vogner group which we've talked about a lot and has been a subject of some [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=622.66s)]
*  Um bonus pods in the past. Um, they were foot soldiers, too [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=626.6600000000001s)]
*  You know, and so a lot of the vogner group guys that were there they were uh moved up to ukraine. So [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=630.58s)]
*  Yes, there was less manpower [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=636.1s)]
*  From the iranian revolutionary guard corps and some of the iranian black militias and hesbullah and russians [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=638.1800000000001s)]
*  But the other thing is it's not just a numbers game [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=644.1s)]
*  You know, it's a psychological point. Um [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=646.9000000000001s)]
*  Do the because there are a significant number of people technically in the syrian military [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=649.86s)]
*  But it wasn't just you know [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=654.98s)]
*  They probably could have put up some kind of fight and could have made this drag on and could have kind of plunged things back [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=657.14s)]
*  Into civil war but I think psychologically [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=662.4200000000001s)]
*  They knew that the cavalry wasn't coming and they knew that the public didn't support them [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=665.46s)]
*  And and so it just collapsed fast and and again, this is not a apples to apples comparison [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=671.0600000000001s)]
*  um, because obviously, you know, the asad regime is a horrific [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=677.3000000000001s)]
*  Entity that these people were serving and and the afghan security forces were were by and large trying to serve a [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=682.4200000000001s)]
*  Better government than the taliban in that case, but in the same way that when the u.s [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=688.6600000000001s)]
*  Pulled out its support for the afghan security forces [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=693.94s)]
*  They collapsed because they they knew that they didn't have the manpower [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=697.5400000000001s)]
*  And the logistics and all the things they needed to fight off the taliban [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=701.3000000000001s)]
*  And so these things can happen rapidly when that psychological [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=704.1s)]
*  Piece shifts now the second part of this is the affirmative part of what the opposition accomplished and you talked about this in a very [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=708.44s)]
*  Good interview with natasha last week, but essentially [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=714.36s)]
*  You know h hts clearly made the best use of this time that they had in iblis province in northwest syria last few years [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=717.72s)]
*  Not only kind of trying to de extrema [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=724.84s)]
*  Extremanize if that's a word but to kind of distance themselves from their their kind of al-qaeda affiliation in the past [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=727.46s)]
*  But to start to build some diplomatic bridges to other aspects the opposition when I look back to when you know [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=733.0s)]
*  Obama was in office and we had someone so with so many problems and probably did all kinds of things wrong [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=739.5600000000001s)]
*  One of the challenges is that the opposition was totally fractured in syria at times and they were fighting with each other and [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=744.6800000000001s)]
*  That the opposite happened this time and I think that's because [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=750.84s)]
*  Work has been done [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=754.84s)]
*  um [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=756.36s)]
*  That none of us saw you know [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=757.4000000000001s)]
*  It was hard to see I mean maybe some very close analysts saw it to try to kind of build lines of communication [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=759.08s)]
*  And to kind of get past some of the differences between some of these opposition groups [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=764.2800000000001s)]
*  But I think also importantly when when people saw that the window was open [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=767.8000000000001s)]
*  You know, they just put that aside nobody was [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=772.6800000000001s)]
*  They they they didn't stop the advance to kind of argue with each other about who was going to be in charge or [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=775.4000000000001s)]
*  Or what have you everybody, you know those people in the south that you mentioned in places like darah, which is south of damascus [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=780.76s)]
*  Those are very different people than the people coming down from the northwest in terms of their political factions [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=786.6s)]
*  But you know what they they didn't they didn't let that get in the way [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=791.5600000000001s)]
*  and so what you saw is a very unified and cohesive syrian people in opposition groups up against a [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=794.76s)]
*  regime that [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=802.28s)]
*  Felt like it was on its last legs and that's I think that accounts that combination of the affirmative work done by the opposition [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=803.4s)]
*  And the decision to choose unity over any kind of you know [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=810.28s)]
*  Let's argue about what happens when we get to damascus before we get there that combined with that psychological tipping point for the regime [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=813.64s)]
*  Is how you get this in eight days? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=819.96s)]
*  Yeah, there was some really interesting reporting in new lines magazine where they talked to some rebel sources who told them that [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=822.04s)]
*  They somehow penetrated this high-level security meeting in aleppo [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=829.56s)]
*  Uh and killed an iranian brigadier general and some syrian officers [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=833.24s)]
*  Which just led the entire security apparatus in aleppo to freak out and fear for their own safety [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=837.16s)]
*  Which allowed them to slip in I guess they also had some sleeper cells inside aleppo [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=842.44s)]
*  Uh, and so ultimately I think the regime was like whoa we can't do this. They tried to pull back to uh, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=846.6s)]
*  Other cities and retrench but then the opposition just moved so quickly that they they essentially steamrolled them [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=852.6s)]
*  I mean it was this unbelievable [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=858.0400000000001s)]
*  Fast moving success but ben I think you got into the more important point here, which is trying to understand hts [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=860.0400000000001s)]
*  Which is this um umbrella organization for uh, you know, what was previously a collection of opposition groups? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=865.8800000000001s)]
*  Led by a game a guy named abu mohammed al-jalani. So let's talk about joly for a second [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=872.6s)]
*  He's a 42 year old according to the various, you know biographies of him [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=876.5200000000001s)]
*  I've been trying to inhale over the last couple weeks. He had grandparents who lived in the golon heights [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=881.0s)]
*  They were driven out by israel. I think he was ultimately born in saudi arabia, but moved back to syria in the late 80s [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=885.96s)]
*  Jelani said he was radicalized by the second intifada in about 2000 [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=892.6s)]
*  That was the major palestinian uprising after the failure of the camp david, uh talks [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=896.7600000000001s)]
*  And then right before the u.s invasion of iraq [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=902.04s)]
*  Asaad started to try to recruit syrian men to travel to iraq to fight the americans [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=905.5600000000001s)]
*  Um, i'm not sure if you've seen this men. It's on youtube. There's this amazing frontline documentary where they interviewed jelani [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=910.12s)]
*  Uh, I think in 2021 and they get into his whole history, but it talks about how asaad was [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=915.72s)]
*  Literally filling buses full of syrian men in front of the u.s. Embassy in damascus [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=921.64s)]
*  Instead sending them to iraq and so jelani is one of those guys he got to [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=927.24s)]
*  He got to iraq before the u.s invasion actually started he fought in the insurgency, uh for several years before being captured by the americans [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=931.48s)]
*  held a camp buka prison which ended up being like the [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=938.84s)]
*  You know, it was like harvard [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=942.36s)]
*  For insurgents, right? It was like all the best in the brightest of the insurgency in terrorism going forward [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=944.6s)]
*  We're at camp buka there. He I guess put together like this long plan for how to battle against asaad in syria [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=949.96s)]
*  I'll fast forward a bit [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=955.5600000000001s)]
*  But you know jelani gets out in I think 2011 or so out of camp buka [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=956.6s)]
*  He gets to syria with the blessing of al baghdaddi who's then the leader of isis. Uh, he forms al nusra [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=960.6s)]
*  But then al nusra broke with isis in 2014 after baghdaddi declared the isis caliphate now included syria as well [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=966.52s)]
*  So jelani was like, you know, screw you. I I don't want you to control my turf. He pledges allegiance to al qaeda [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=973.16s)]
*  Jelani then publicly breaks with al qaeda in 2017 [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=979.16s)]
*  There's a lot of questions I think that are fair to ask here about you know when he talks about [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=982.6999999999999s)]
*  Not liking isis or al qaeda's tactics or whether you know that's sincere whether it was a power play [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=987.5s)]
*  But then as you mentioned jelani rules idlib province in northwest syria for several years [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=992.9399999999999s)]
*  They administered services they trained they built up their capacity to do this [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=997.9s)]
*  And they clearly gained a close relationship with erdogan and the turks that have helped sort of arm and equip them and enable this [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1002.54s)]
*  But um jelani sat down with cnn a couple days ago [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1009.58s)]
*  Um where that he was asked about you know, his ties to extremism and world view [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1012.94s)]
*  Here's a clip from that interview people who fear islamic governance either have seen incorrect implementations of it or do not understand it properly [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1017.34s)]
*  We are talking about something that aligns with the traditions and nature of the region [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1025.74s)]
*  The most important thing is to build institutions [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1030.7s)]
*  We are not talking about rule by individuals or personal whims it's about institutional governance [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1034.3999999999999s)]
*  No one has the right to erase another group [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1041.28s)]
*  These sects have coexisted in this region for hundreds of years and no one has the right to eliminate them [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1043.9199999999998s)]
*  There must be a legal framework that protects and ensures the rights of all [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1050.32s)]
*  Not a system that serves only one sect as asad's regime has done [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1054.9599999999998s)]
*  One is one of the factions in the region just like all the others now we're talking about a larger project [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1058.88s)]
*  We're talking about building syria [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1066.4s)]
*  Is merely one detail of this dialogue and it may dissolve at any time [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1070.0s)]
*  It's not an end in itself, but a means to perform a task confronting this regime [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1075.2s)]
*  Once that task is complete it will transition to a state of governance institutions and so on [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1081.92s)]
*  So ben, I mean, this is a big question, right? I mean is he sincerely moderated is he saying the right things? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1088.0s)]
*  He's he's like wearing, you know business suits to interviews. It's all for show [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1093.9199999999998s)]
*  I mean, I I think the answer is maybe unknowable, but I wonder what you make of this guy [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1098.8s)]
*  Well to start at the end. I mean he's saying exactly what [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1103.1999999999998s)]
*  Everybody wants to hear and not just people like us, but I mean people in syria all these minority factions [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1107.76s)]
*  We talked about the religious factions where you've got alawites and shia and christians and and the sunni arab majority [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1113.76s)]
*  But you know all you kurdish factions and different political factions within the sunni arab community [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1118.88s)]
*  What he is saying is exactly what I think most syrians want to hear which is [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1124.4s)]
*  Let's have like a government that negotiates among these different factions protects everybody's rights and ultimately has institutions [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1129.28s)]
*  That don't favor one over the other [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1136.48s)]
*  And that is the essential thing [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1138.5600000000002s)]
*  To build trust with people going forward is is is can you have a system? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1140.8s)]
*  In which syrians can just kind of work this out amongst themselves peacefully [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1145.36s)]
*  Instead of resorting to violence and sometimes that violence has been kind of pushed or instigated by external forces as well [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1149.2s)]
*  And I know that's been a source of a lot of frustration to syrians to roll back the tape tommy the couple things that are interesting [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1155.36s)]
*  To me [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1160.96s)]
*  First this is a reminder just jelani's history of of how much if you want to pick a time to start [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1162.0s)]
*  The a certain window of history in the middle east the iraq war unleashed so many things [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1168.64s)]
*  I mean because this guy's story does not begin in 2011 with the arab spring [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1173.8400000000001s)]
*  When we saw protests and people writing, you know, asaad must go on walls [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1179.1200000000001s)]
*  His story begins with the invasion of iraq and then as a young man getting bused to [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1182.48s)]
*  to to iraq where he kind of becomes part of the sunni insurgency because a [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1186.96s)]
*  Sunni leader and a bath party leader in saddam hussein has been overthrown and now there's a shia majority population kind of governing country [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1191.92s)]
*  He gets you know those skill sets that you talked about in prison [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1198.72s)]
*  He you know, and this is the point about and and this is the next thing I was to say about al-nusra the nusra front [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1202.5600000000002s)]
*  They were you know, probably [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1208.64s)]
*  I don't know one of if not the most prominent opposition force when we were in government [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1210.72s)]
*  um [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1216.4s)]
*  I always thought it was strange and you know, we can talk about [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1217.44s)]
*  policies maybe in this later in this podcast or another time [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1221.68s)]
*  You may remember tommy the rollout when uh, the u.s was simultaneously, uh [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1225.44s)]
*  Arming the opposition but we're going to designate the nusra front as terrorists. It was kind of a one of these classic [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1230.88s)]
*  Dumb u.s government logic, you know things which is that well we're getting some criticism for beginning to arm [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1237.68s)]
*  An opposition that includes some extremist elements [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1243.2s)]
*  So we're also going to designate these people as terrorists as if you can sit in washington and design [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1244.96s)]
*  through things like designations and you know, uh [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1250.56s)]
*  Who the opposition is? Uh again [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1253.6000000000001s)]
*  One of many ways in which the united states has gotten this wrong over the years [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1256.64s)]
*  Um, but I think because the the challenge there is yes [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1261.04s)]
*  There are extremists and baghdadian what became isis is a clear signal of the kind of extremism that is possible [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1264.0s)]
*  But some of these people have just been fighting on the same side of different insurgencies for a long time [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1269.76s)]
*  You know, so in the insurgency in iraq you had people that were al-qaeda then you had people that you know may [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1274.0800000000002s)]
*  May not have believed the full al-qaeda ideology or agenda, but they were fighting the same enemy [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1279.76s)]
*  So they were fighting together and we just don't understand this, you know [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1285.76s)]
*  We have to have some humility that we can sit and and know which individual is you know, uh, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1290.1599999999999s)]
*  Is where on the spectrum between say, you know isis and al-qaeda to kind of peaceful islamists [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1297.76s)]
*  Because there certainly can be islamists who want to set up institutions peacefully [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1304.7199999999998s)]
*  If you rule if you if you rule out that possibility, uh, the one thing jelani is right about is you you can't tell people [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1310.1599999999999s)]
*  Um, you know if you if you rule out the possibility for there to be any islamist character to some of these political movements [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1316.56s)]
*  Well, you're ensuring some kind of you know hyper minority rule [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1322.56s)]
*  Against against the broader population. So all that's to say his evolution is really interesting. I think it speaks to how much [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1326.24s)]
*  both u.s [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1333.9199999999998s)]
*  Policy through the iraq war and through the syrians of war kind of helped foster some of these dynamics for bad and maybe good at times [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1334.56s)]
*  Um, but how ultimately he's kind of arrived at his own formula [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1341.84s)]
*  um, and what we don't know [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1345.44s)]
*  Is whether that formula is a true transition as he says to kind of a negotiation between different factions and the establishment of a new government [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1347.6799999999998s)]
*  Or whether you know as we've seen in other countries [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1356.32s)]
*  Hgs will say it's doing that and then never really let go we we don't know [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1359.3600000000001s)]
*  But what we do know is this is now in the hands of syrians principally and and I think that alone is a lot of progress [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1363.44s)]
*  From either being in asad's hand or or being something that people who don't fully understand syria are kind of negotiating in [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1369.92s)]
*  geneva or the gulf [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1377.26s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, uh, so asad was an al-await. I think like 12 to 14 percent of the country's al-await sort of a classic [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1379.2s)]
*  Uh, you know, it's a colonial put a minority sect in charge set up so they oppress everybody else, but their message was always [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1384.96s)]
*  to all minority groups that if you know, essentially a sunni [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1393.44s)]
*  Islamic caliphate is established across syria all of you will be massacred [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1397.68s)]
*  christians druze [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1403.1000000000001s)]
*  shia everyone [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1404.94s)]
*  Um, that was the asad narrative that it was very powerful and clearly [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1406.64s)]
*  Jolani's identified that and is trying to cut against it [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1410.4s)]
*  And I think you know, I talked to natasha last week. She said she personally knew al-awaits living in idlib province who felt safe [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1413.84s)]
*  Josh rogan at the washington post tweeted today that he interviewed the bishop of aleppo [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1422.0s)]
*  He told me his community members are safe and give syrians credit for being able to live together [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1427.84s)]
*  He said don't fall for propaganda that asad was the protector of christians [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1432.24s)]
*  You know robert ford who was the u.s ambassador to syria when we were in government then [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1437.28s)]
*  Um has sort of a rule of thumb which is like, okay [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1442.4s)]
*  Look where the refugees are fleeing to and where they're fleeing from [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1444.8s)]
*  Uh, and clearly you saw millions of people move from asad controlled territory to hts controlled territory [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1449.2s)]
*  You know, none of this is like whitewashing their behavior. There's lots of reports of hts [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1456.56s)]
*  You know [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1462.0800000000002s)]
*  Torturing people arresting journalists or people that criticize them on social media [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1462.96s)]
*  Clearly they believe in a pretty strict islamic fundamentalist view of the world [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1468.48s)]
*  But you know a jolani either through really, you know brilliant pr or through [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1473.68s)]
*  evolution and and [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1479.42s)]
*  Growth has evolved into this kind of new narrative, but it's interesting then. Um into 2021. He does this frontline interview [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1481.6000000000001s)]
*  I didn't realize this that the the u.s state department put out the following tweet in arabic [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1488.72s)]
*  Oh, hello, jolani you handsome one. What a cute suit you can change what you wear, but you are still a terrorist [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1494.08s)]
*  Don't forget the 10 million dollar reward on your head. So that was the response [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1499.76s)]
*  What yeah, I wonder who wrote that [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1504.72s)]
*  Again [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1509.68s)]
*  Nusra front, you know certainly [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1511.1200000000001s)]
*  Committed atrocities in the syrian civil war [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1514.14s)]
*  um [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1517.68s)]
*  And we don't know [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1518.8799999999999s)]
*  Exactly where this is going. I will just reiterate [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1521.12s)]
*  We have to allow some room [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1525.84s)]
*  uh [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1528.32s)]
*  Not just some I mean the syrians get to figure this out [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1529.76s)]
*  It's their country if there's one thing and i'm going to repeat this because it's important [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1532.3999999999999s)]
*  That i've learned in 13 years. Is it a bunch of people sitting, you know in washington or geneva or [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1536.96s)]
*  abu dhabi or [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1543.34s)]
*  Or istanbul, you know [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1545.12s)]
*  They they don't they're not going to know syria as well syrians [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1547.76s)]
*  And they're not going to be able to kind of you know [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1551.04s)]
*  Orchestrate the syrian politics from from abroad even though they're never going to have some influence and what you have to allow for [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1553.26s)]
*  Is the possibility that a guy like jolani? [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1560.9599999999998s)]
*  May have learned a lot over the course of the last decade and may have sincerely decided that it's a better [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1564.7199999999998s)]
*  Approach to try to negotiate differences with factions [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1570.8799999999999s)]
*  Uh that ultimately he doesn't want to keep fighting in an endless civil war so better to treat [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1574.32s)]
*  christians and [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1579.76s)]
*  Shia and and other minority populations. Well rather than kind of being in in a permanent conflict state [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1581.44s)]
*  we have to allow for that possibility and I say this because [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1587.84s)]
*  you know early in the [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1591.28s)]
*  arab spring [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1593.68s)]
*  You know, I think there was just an immediate skepticism of anybody that had a muslim brotherhood background coming to politics [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1594.72s)]
*  And you saw this obviously most acutely in egypt. Yeah, where you know the rest of the region [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1601.84s)]
*  Its leaders at least did not did not want to allow for the possibility [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1607.04s)]
*  That a muhammad morsi in egypt could be anything other than an existential threat to them now to be fair [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1611.52s)]
*  Muslim brotherhood also overreached in egypt during its period of governance and was starting to kind of crack down on on its opponents. So [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1618.08s)]
*  A lot of open space here, but the the problem with that tweet and that mindset in that tweet [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1626.0s)]
*  Is it just insists that [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1630.88s)]
*  That [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1634.64s)]
*  Somebody is the worst version of who the united states government believes them to be [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1635.6s)]
*  Or that somebody in their movement is incapable of changing [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1639.1200000000001s)]
*  And at a minimum, it's a good thing that asad is gone [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1643.04s)]
*  And now uh, we don't know what's going to happen and i'm not making predictions about what's gonna happen [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1649.2s)]
*  But we also kind of owe it to the syrian people to give this a chance and to see that see if they there can be you know [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1654.24s)]
*  A negotiated process and clearly the fact they were clearly negotiating with this prime minister [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1661.1999999999998s)]
*  To have a transition and to come into damascus peacefully [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1666.9599999999998s)]
*  I mean the fact that they had no resistance there that there was clearly some back channeling going on some dialogue [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1669.9199999999998s)]
*  And now what do you want to you want to see is whether that kind of continues to be the predominant strain in syrian politics or whether [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1675.04s)]
*  You start to see reprisals and violence between factions again, so we'll know what happens here [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1681.68s)]
*  But I I think we need to allow for the possibility [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1686.24s)]
*  That maybe yeah, we were wrong here. Well or at least like just not [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1689.84s)]
*  Decide that it's binary you are a terrorist and you're stamped as such by our designations or you are not [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1694.96s)]
*  I mean certainly it is the case that jelani and al-nusra [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1699.84s)]
*  Uh were part of isis pledge allegiance to al-qaeda and then left certainly [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1703.28s)]
*  It's true that they have a fundamentalist islamist view of the world [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1707.84s)]
*  There is a sense that they want to put in place a government led by sharia law [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1711.9199999999998s)]
*  It's also true that they have used violence including the killing of civilians to advance political aims [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1716.1599999999999s)]
*  So by every definition they that is terrorism, but the question becomes [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1721.52s)]
*  Is it transnational terrorism like al-qaeda and isis where they want to kill all? [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1726.6399999999999s)]
*  Uh non-believers everywhere or was this really like nationalism? [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1731.28s)]
*  In service of a political project within syria that was about ousting a dictator and what you ultimately end up with [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1735.54s)]
*  Is something? [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1743.06s)]
*  More moderate. I mean he he says he will [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1744.34s)]
*  Allow for some sort of minority rights or acceptance or existence [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1747.1399999999999s)]
*  in [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1751.78s)]
*  Syria now that you you raise the bigger question then which is like does jelani survive is he is his faction the one that comes out of [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1752.5s)]
*  This two-week process in charge [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1760.98s)]
*  Um, but another big set of questions is like what does the international community do to help this revolution succeed? [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1763.62s)]
*  Is there sanctions relief? Is there economic support on behalf of? [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1770.58s)]
*  some kind of [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1774.5s)]
*  Political entity that gets set up like the now is a part of the podcast where we're just going to start asking questions about things [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1776.1799999999998s)]
*  That are coming that we just absolutely don't know the answer to well [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1781.22s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, uh, what is the role of the international community? [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1784.4199999999998s)]
*  Because I I think in terms of domestic syrian politics [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1786.82s)]
*  You would just hope that there's a structured process for negotiation about what this transition is who it's to [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1790.5s)]
*  You know does it lead to institution building does it lead to elections at some point? [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1796.1s)]
*  They've got a lot of questions to figure out the international community's objective right now [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1798.98s)]
*  I think should be to provide as much support as possible [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1803.54s)]
*  Um now number one is there some kind of capacity and you know from the un or anywhere else to kind of help with the structure? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1806.34s)]
*  And process of that negotiation number two their huge humanitarian needs in syria [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1813.62s)]
*  decimated by 13 years of war [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1819.84s)]
*  You know mass majority of the population is living underneath the poverty level [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1822.26s)]
*  Uh, there's going to be some disruptions probably in services as this thing transitions and so providing support [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1826.18s)]
*  Yes, I mean no reason for those sanctions that were on asad and and and also just providing direct assistance and here by the way [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1832.5s)]
*  The gulf arabs have a lot of resources and and so can there be some kind of coordinated effort? [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1838.66s)]
*  To kind of help begin to rebuild syria. That's a role for the international community [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1843.54s)]
*  I think there's you know, also a role to prevent bad actors from trying to fill vacuums [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1848.1s)]
*  Today you saw the u.s. Take I think something like 50 airstrikes against isis [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1853.78s)]
*  I'm sure part of the thinking there which is understandable is like let's just kind of we know who where all the worst actors are [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1858.1799999999998s)]
*  Let's try to keep them on the back foot here [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1865.4599999999998s)]
*  So this thing doesn't get disrailed by you know isis suddenly emerging back on the scene and making a dash at some city [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1867.1399999999999s)]
*  Um, and then the other piece it'll be really interesting to watch tommy is I believe that a lot of syrian refugees [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1874.34s)]
*  Want to go home, you know counter to the narrative, uh, you know that they they wanted to just kind of come into europe and no [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1880.8999999999999s)]
*  The vast majority refugees I've met in my life would like nothing more than to return to the place that they're from [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1888.58s)]
*  That is a massive enterprise. You're talking millions and millions and millions [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1893.6999999999998s)]
*  I mean, i've lost track of how many millions of syrians [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1897.9399999999998s)]
*  At least five million, I believe are living outside the country and europe and other places and you know [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1900.74s)]
*  So that's something that's got to be coordinated now [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1905.6200000000001s)]
*  um, you know that that's a new dynamic and and [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1908.42s)]
*  It points to how hopeful this could be that that you know counter to the kind of refugee crisis that has persisted since 9 11 [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1912.42s)]
*  Because of all these conflicts we had the possibility of people going home [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1920.66s)]
*  So that's a lot of reason for the international community to remain invested here to try to make this work [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1923.54s)]
*  This is where I think is an opportunity because you could imagine a good version of this conversation where a bunch of european leaders [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1927.8600000000001s)]
*  Say to their people we need to step up and provide direct support to syria right now to create the [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1934.82s)]
*  Opportunity for refugees to go home and live where they want to live [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1942.4s)]
*  You could see a bad version of this conversation where some of these right-wing parties in europe say now is the moment [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1946.5s)]
*  We need to expel these syrian refugees [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1952.66s)]
*  And get them the fuck out of here because the war you know what I mean? And so you're right. That's exactly [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1955.22s)]
*  That's what this has happened fast, but then let's talk about um, us interests for a minute, too [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1959.06s)]
*  Um, I imagine the us and there's a reporting on this is very very worried about asad's chemical weapons stockpiles [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1965.54s)]
*  Uh who has control of those what is going to happen? [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1973.22s)]
*  This is another area where jelani is saying the right things and saying he'll allow an international inspectors [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1975.78s)]
*  But I would imagine you would want more than that [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1979.86s)]
*  There's the us alliance with these kurdish factions in northeast syria that have been bravely fighting isis for a long time [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1983.22s)]
*  there are not only isis prisoners, but there are [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1989.94s)]
*  Tens of thousands of people who are just swept up in these counter isis operations including women and children living in these horrific camps [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=1993.22s)]
*  Everyone needs to figure out what to do with them including whether some of these individuals are repatriated to the countries where they're from [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2000.58s)]
*  Um, and then president biden went out today to talk about these events [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2006.9s)]
*  Here's a clip of that [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2012.5s)]
*  You know over the past four years my administration pursued a clear principle policy towards syria [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2014.26s)]
*  first [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2019.54s)]
*  We made clear from the start [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2020.82s)]
*  sanction on ra on a ra asad [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2023.38s)]
*  Would remain in place unless he engaged seriously in a political process to end the civil war [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2026.02s)]
*  second [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2031.62s)]
*  We maintained our military presence in syria [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2032.58s)]
*  our counter isis [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2035.7s)]
*  To counter the support of local partners as well on the ground [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2037.3s)]
*  Their partners never ceded an inch of territory third [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2040.98s)]
*  We've supported israel's freedom of action against iranian networks in syria [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2045.6999999999998s)]
*  And against actors aligned with iran [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2049.94s)]
*  Transported lethal aid to lebanon [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2053.06s)]
*  And when necessary order the use of military force against iranian networks [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2055.7799999999997s)]
*  to protect u.s forces [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2059.86s)]
*  Our approach has shifted the balance of power in the middle east [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2062.34s)]
*  through this combination of support for our partners [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2065.7s)]
*  Sanctions and diplomacy and targeted military force were necessary [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2068.82s)]
*  We now see new opportunities opening up for the people of syria and for the entire region [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2073.94s)]
*  So, uh, that's president biden today [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2078.74s)]
*  Look, I think it would have been a little more credible to say [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2080.74s)]
*  Hey, we fed, uh a ton of arms to the ukrainians who used it to fight and bleed out the russians [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2083.54s)]
*  Who were distracted and then we gave a ton of arms to the israelis [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2090.9s)]
*  Who used them in gaza and then used them against our will to start another front in another war in lebanon [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2094.44s)]
*  Where they smoked a bunch of hesbulla guys, so those were huge drivers of these events rather than be like see [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2099.72s)]
*  Policy nailed it. Yeah, I I there [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2105.88s)]
*  There was never any indication whatsoever from the biden administration that that they had you know that they were focused on [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2108.68s)]
*  asad going [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2117.4s)]
*  You know, I think obviously scarred by the experience of the obama administration. They they you know [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2119.08s)]
*  Lower their ambitions to pretty focused missions. So so this has not happened because of us policy [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2123.48s)]
*  This has happened again because of syrians [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2130.28s)]
*  You're right. Tommy though if he did want to kind of draw some correlations [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2132.68s)]
*  It actually it wouldn't be that we had sanctioned. I mean keeping sanctions on asad and insisting he [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2136.36s)]
*  Negotiate a certain way had nothing to do with this outcome. You're right though that [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2141.46s)]
*  Uh the support for ukraine which obviously, uh has kept russia diverted up there was a part of it and also [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2145.64s)]
*  In addition to the support to the israeli military, you know [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2153.1600000000003s)]
*  The u.s has taken some shots at some of these proxy militias in syria since october 7th [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2156.84s)]
*  It's very bank shotty, you know [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2162.76s)]
*  And again, I think the main factors you had to do with like what the syrian opposition was able to do themselves [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2166.84s)]
*  Um, but the u.s was a part of that picture that obviously distracted or degraded [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2173.6400000000003s)]
*  Um asad's [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2178.7599999999998s)]
*  Main backers and you're right going forward. I think you know the hardcore, you know [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2181.0s)]
*  Security interests are making sure that chemical weapons sockpile whatever remains of it is secure and hopefully, you know [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2186.9199999999996s)]
*  destroyed [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2194.2799999999997s)]
*  um, and you know making sure that isis doesn't [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2195.3199999999997s)]
*  um reemerge [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2199.16s)]
*  in any fashion [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2201.48s)]
*  and then you know, you don't you don't want to see kind of a [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2203.16s)]
*  The the political process failed to the extent that there's some disintegration again of the syrian state and and you know that that kind of [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2205.96s)]
*  Becomes a force for instability. So you'd like to see a process that again may be messy [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2214.44s)]
*  I mean none of us should expect [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2219.4s)]
*  You know the the ideal democracy in syria in six months [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2221.4s)]
*  I mean, we're still working on it here in the united states, you know 250 years later [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2225.8s)]
*  So allow for some nelson mandela. Yeah, but and you know this builds on what we're saying about jelani allow for some [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2229.96s)]
*  bumpiness here, but if it holds together that's [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2236.2s)]
*  hugely preferable to either disintegration or [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2240.28s)]
*  To asad the only other thing i'd raise here tommy is that what is also in the u.s interest [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2243.64s)]
*  But I think what people in the region maybe aren't saying out loud is where does where does this go next? [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2248.36s)]
*  Right because as you and I experienced in the contagion of the arab spring [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2254.12s)]
*  People in egypt where there is a loathed dictator are watching this and thinking well [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2258.2s)]
*  Wait, maybe cc could collapse like a house of cards king of dalla is very vulnerable in jordan because of the war in gaza [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2263.4s)]
*  And anger from his population [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2270.92s)]
*  So there are that that's the other thing that the u.s. I think is gonna be watching is is does this become contagious in some way? [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2273.96s)]
*  Yeah, and also I think we will probably be eager to leap on the opportunity that comes from the russians getting ice out of syria [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2280.44s)]
*  Losing access not only to a a big naval base in the med but also an airfield as you mentioned earlier [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2287.08s)]
*  You know, I think a lot of um the russian operations in africa have been run through syria over time [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2293.24s)]
*  So this could cut off that that access point as well. So that's a pretty big win [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2299.4s)]
*  For the united states there just on the american political front then two other things [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2304.6s)]
*  I mean trump has been truthing about this. I think the one that really matters was yesterday [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2308.7599999999998s)]
*  He had a long statement where he kind of like narrated events [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2313.48s)]
*  Uh slapped obama around for the red line and then ended it with in all cap saying [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2316.44s)]
*  The united states should have nothing to do with it. This is not our fight. Let it play out do not get involved. So trump's [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2321.4s)]
*  Uh pretty clear position there you and I debated this last week. It seems that this hasn't changed [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2328.52s)]
*  But there are there's also still the very awkward [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2333.16s)]
*  Uh confirmation hearing that's going to come up for tulsi gabbard to run our intelligence community [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2336.04s)]
*  because she's a woman who still doubts that [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2340.84s)]
*  Uh assad was the one who used chemical weapons on his own people. She has said he is not our enemy [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2343.96s)]
*  Um as these opposition groups sweep through through syria, I imagine they're going to collect [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2350.2799999999997s)]
*  ungodly amounts of evidence of war crimes [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2356.58s)]
*  And other horrors by the assad regime so this could it's going to make for a bumpy hearing for her [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2359.56s)]
*  Yeah, I think the record-keeping among the syrian secret police was at like stasi level. So [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2364.52s)]
*  Um, you know finding the you know going to g and pulling out gabard, uh, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2371.08s)]
*  And seeing what's in that file would be quite interesting, you know, because i'm sure they recorded [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2375.48s)]
*  You know what she talked to assad about and whatever other contacts she had with syrian government [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2379.64s)]
*  So that bears watching it is it is a genuine [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2384.52s)]
*  Strategic blow to the russians to just build on the thing you said before [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2388.42s)]
*  Um, you know to lose this conduit in the mediterranean and down to africa [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2392.92s)]
*  Um, and and so watching how that plays out is going to be something that [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2397.08s)]
*  Uh that will you know will be interesting but to the trump point of like stay out [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2400.7599999999998s)]
*  That's probably net net the best thing you could possibly say for the syrians themselves, you know [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2406.2s)]
*  I would like to see as we just discussed a u.s [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2412.04s)]
*  Government that you know would credibly provide a lot of assistance and try to you know [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2414.2799999999997s)]
*  Work with the gulf countries to mobilize more resources [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2418.2799999999997s)]
*  So there are good things that the u.s could be doing but [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2421.16s)]
*  I would rather trump just say leave it alone. Then he he started meddling around in there [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2424.52s)]
*  So maybe maybe that statement's for the best, you know [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2429.08s)]
*  Yeah, maybe uh, let more competent people take over though. I don't know. Hopefully none of these sort of [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2431.96s)]
*  Arsonists in the gulf decide to pick a side and yes another civil war [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2436.58s)]
*  I mean, that's the worst case scenario for the syrian people one other big u.s interest ben is uh, uh, uh [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2440.6s)]
*  Journalist named austin teis. He went missing 12 years ago in syria [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2445.4s)]
*  Uh his family and the biden administration says they believe he is still alive [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2450.04s)]
*  I guess u.s officials according to cnn have been in touch with opposition forces about trying to locate austin teis [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2454.04s)]
*  Um, I think everyone just you know, praise this guy is okay, but he has been [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2459.8s)]
*  In syria for a long time. It would be incredible to see him released as you know [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2463.64s)]
*  Among these political prisoners who have just been rotting in these syrian prisons slash torture chambers slash, you know execution sites forever [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2468.68s)]
*  The other people that are watching that's very closely the ben are the israelis. Um, you know netanyahu [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2476.84s)]
*  Uh, you know, it shares a border with syria [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2482.46s)]
*  They just you know, the israelis have been hitting targets both in damascus and they just took a bunch of territory [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2485.42s)]
*  In the golon heights to try to improve their buffer zone [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2490.86s)]
*  Between israel and syria, uh, president netanyahu gave some speech about this today did it in english [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2494.14s)]
*  So we have a clip of it. I'll listen to that this collapse [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2501.1s)]
*  Is a direct result of our forceful action against his bala in iran asad's main supporters [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2504.94s)]
*  It set off a chain reaction of all those who want to free themselves from this tyranny and its suppression [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2511.18s)]
*  But it also means we have to take action against possible threats [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2516.7s)]
*  One of them is the collapse of the separation of forces agreement from 1974 between israel and syria this agreement held for 50 years [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2520.2999999999997s)]
*  Last night it collapsed the syrian army abandoned its positions [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2529.2599999999998s)]
*  We gave the israeli army the order to take over these positions [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2533.18s)]
*  to ensure [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2537.74s)]
*  That no hostile force embeds itself right next to the border of israel. This is a temporary defensive position until a suitable arrangement is found [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2539.2599999999998s)]
*  Equally, we send a hand of peace [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2547.74s)]
*  To all those beyond our border in syria to the jews [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2550.54s)]
*  To the kurds to the christians and to the muslims who want to live in peace with israel [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2555.02s)]
*  We're going to follow events very carefully if we can establish [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2560.54s)]
*  Uh neighborly relations and a peaceful relations with the new forces emerging in syria [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2564.22s)]
*  That's our desire [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2569.98s)]
*  But if we do not we'll do whatever it takes to defend the state of israel and the border of israel [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2571.3399999999997s)]
*  Every netanyahu statement boils down to like if I feel like killing you I will do it [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2577.42s)]
*  Yeah, and that and that is that um, you know, you could imagine a scenario where the israelis are happy that [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2581.58s)]
*  um [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2587.02s)]
*  There's no longer an asad government that is friendly enough with iran to allow them to transit arms [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2587.98s)]
*  Through syria constantly to give to hesbullah to use to attack israel. That said I think the israelis had those um [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2593.8999999999996s)]
*  Those shipping routes pretty well wired and would just blow them up on the regular [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2600.94s)]
*  Uh, and at the end of the day, they're probably a lot more worried about a potential islamist [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2604.8599999999997s)]
*  Government on their on their flank, but i'm I don't know. I I imagine it's just mostly anxiety then [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2610.14s)]
*  Yeah, I mean as usual too. It was an entirely securitized [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2615.8199999999997s)]
*  statement, um [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2620.54s)]
*  You know with notably this focus on the border [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2622.22s)]
*  um, you know, I I think for israel this you know, so-called axis of resistance, uh that you know iran [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2625.5s)]
*  Hezbollah the asad regime [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2632.8599999999997s)]
*  All these militias in iraq and and you know in some ways the houthis [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2635.4199999999996s)]
*  Um, this is a huge blow. It's kind of the end of a version of that because you no longer have asad you've got [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2639.1s)]
*  Hezbollah really on its back foot, you know, solomani's dead, you know nisrallah's dead asad's living in moscow [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2646.54s)]
*  Um, that's something you know that the israelis i'm sure welcome and and obviously had something to do with [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2654.14s)]
*  On the other end to your point. I mean, I remember [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2661.02s)]
*  You know when we were in in the obama administration there was never really a push [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2663.58s)]
*  From for all the people that were kind of pushing for the u.s to militarily kind of do regime change in syria [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2668.22s)]
*  Um that that never came from israel [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2674.62s)]
*  I think there was always some ambivalence [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2677.5s)]
*  About what might replace asad? [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2679.8199999999997s)]
*  And so it was kind of how can we crush this network? We don't like this axis of resistance, but maybe you know [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2681.8999999999996s)]
*  We're not quite sure if that necessarily means, you know going to the unknown of a new government [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2688.2999999999997s)]
*  Um, I think you know, we don't know i'm sure there's differences of you and israel about that [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2693.2599999999998s)]
*  Um, so I think you know the they'll be watching very closely, you know what emerges here given what they're doing in gaza [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2697.3399999999997s)]
*  Right now I can't imagine that you know public opinion in syria is going to look favorably [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2703.8199999999997s)]
*  Um to kind of having a warm relationship with israel [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2710.22s)]
*  And so it sounds like he's going to keep it very transactional kind of focused on the border [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2713.9799999999996s)]
*  I mean you hope that that's it that there's not [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2718.22s)]
*  You know, they don't try to fill some vacuum in ways that they have in lebanon at times and [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2721.02s)]
*  You know some territorial buffer zone that kind of creates tensions [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2725.8199999999997s)]
*  We should name the fact that the israel's already annexed the golan heights, which is not something they did through any international agreement [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2729.58s)]
*  so there's a place for tension here, but [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2737.42s)]
*  You know, I think they'll probably watch this, you know warily [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2740.3s)]
*  like [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2743.58s)]
*  You know like they do everything in their neighborhood [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2744.78s)]
*  Um, so we had also we we'd asked for our awesome pod save the world discord users to send us some questions [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2746.86s)]
*  We actually kind of covered two of the three [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2752.78s)]
*  I plucked out then so the sharkulent asked about the refugee crisis in europe, which we talked about [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2755.74s)]
*  um [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2760.94s)]
*  poto pre 97 asked about [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2761.9s)]
*  uh tulsi gabard in her weird affinity [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2764.54s)]
*  for uh for asad and uh, I think we got it covered how that might make her confirmation hearing pretty weird one we should definitely just [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2768.06s)]
*  talk about because um, it looms so large in both of our our brains and consciences is a question from curry roux, which is [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2775.34s)]
*  Why didn't obama intervene back in 2013? [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2783.02s)]
*  I don't like counterfactuals, but i'd imagine we'd be celebrating this moment a decade ago sans hundreds of thousands of deaths if he did [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2785.98s)]
*  um [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2792.5400000000004s)]
*  good question, uh [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2793.7400000000002s)]
*  and impossible to answer [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2795.98s)]
*  You know, it's impossible to know if that would have been the case [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2798.5400000000004s)]
*  Then you know if this would have ended the same I think [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2802.46s)]
*  um all the pieces of context we talked about at the top ben [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2805.26s)]
*  Um are what got us to this moment and the idea that [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2809.18s)]
*  Uh a u.s. Military intervention intervention in 2013 [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2812.94s)]
*  would have led to [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2817.1s)]
*  a clean, um [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2818.7799999999997s)]
*  Outcome or [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2821.42s)]
*  you know [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2823.2599999999998s)]
*  The the outcome that we all wanted is is it's hard to say [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2824.38s)]
*  I mean, I guess what i'm trying to say and i'm stumbling on it is uh, u.s. Military interventions have not gone very well everywhere [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2827.5s)]
*  And what we're talking about [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2833.98s)]
*  in in 2013 was a very limited response to the use of uh syrian chemical weapons [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2835.58s)]
*  And trump eventually did basically exactly that he he hit a bunch of runways and absolutely nothing changed what I think a lot of people [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2843.1s)]
*  Really wanted from the obama administration was a full-scale [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2850.86s)]
*  Uh regime change operation in syria, and I think that just wasn't on the table for a variety of reasons [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2853.7400000000002s)]
*  but first and foremost the fact that [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2859.58s)]
*  U.s. Regime change operations tend to uh end in [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2861.8199999999997s)]
*  Disaster which doesn't mean the outcome that doesn't mean I think the last 12 years was good [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2865.2599999999998s)]
*  In any way shape or form or that we wouldn't do things differently [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2869.8199999999997s)]
*  I'm sure there's a million things obama would do differently if he had the chance, but I don't know what what are your thoughts on this one? [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2872.14s)]
*  yeah, I guess um, we're freely [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2877.8199999999997s)]
*  acknowledging, uh the the failures of the obama policy to [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2881.4s)]
*  um [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2886.14s)]
*  to to effectuate [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2887.34s)]
*  This this transition, uh, I guess what I'd say is that first of all the war started in 2011 [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2889.02s)]
*  You know and even by that chemical weapons attack in 2013 [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2894.7s)]
*  You'd seen the wild scale use of barrel bombs. You'd seen, you know, horrific massacres [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2898.62s)]
*  Sometimes it weirdly in retrospect. It's like [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2903.98s)]
*  This chemical weapons happened [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2906.78s)]
*  Attack happened in 2013 obama didn't do the red line and and that kind of caused everything [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2908.62s)]
*  the that happened in the middle and [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2914.78s)]
*  We we will never know if that kind of cruise missile strike would have somehow scrambled the decks [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2917.5800000000004s)]
*  um, but what we do know is [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2923.26s)]
*  That in the ensuing years a lot has changed and part of what's changed is that you know iran hesblah and russia have been either [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2925.7400000000002s)]
*  Distracted or weakened part of what's strange is the ways in which the syrian opposition got themselves together [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2932.38s)]
*  um, but I still think the most important thing [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2937.7400000000002s)]
*  is that [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2941.6600000000003s)]
*  If we had done the regime change [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2943.82s)]
*  To your point tommy then it's another u.s [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2946.1400000000003s)]
*  regime change war like afghanistan like iraq like libya where oftentimes we are well intentioned about who we would like to see take [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2947.98s)]
*  Over the country, but there's something about a foreign government [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2954.86s)]
*  particularly united states [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2958.46s)]
*  Bringing about the regime change that creates a particular kind of instability because you don't have the same legitimacy [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2960.1400000000003s)]
*  On the ground the the us feels more compelled to pick winners and to start meddling in the politics [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2966.86s)]
*  Then you know, maybe there's some foreign forces who become a target for people who want to drill things [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2972.86s)]
*  um, so I do think it is better that [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2977.82s)]
*  You know obama or some other u.s president isn't the one who removed asad that it was syrians who did this on their own [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2981.9s)]
*  um [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2989.26s)]
*  Again, that is not to absolve us. I always just say to people don't just question this, uh red line decision, you know question [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2990.38s)]
*  What I said earlier, you know, we were supporting the opposition while designating part of them as terrorists [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=2998.7s)]
*  What was with your strategy for how you supported the opposition? [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3003.58s)]
*  some people question the decision to call for asad to go before you know, there was a [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3006.86s)]
*  A plan essentially to make that happen and then that might have caused him to dig in harder and to be even worse [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3011.9s)]
*  Um, i'm not sure about that, but that's worth looking at too [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3017.02s)]
*  To me, it's not that i'm defensive about the red line per se. I mean at the time I wanted to you know, uh, [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3020.38s)]
*  Bomb syria after that incident [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3027.02s)]
*  It's simply that it's kind of become this this simplistic way of viewing this entire war [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3029.26s)]
*  You know this 13 year civil war was about a lot more than this one decision by barack obama [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3035.34s)]
*  Um where he frankly would not have had any political support in the u.s to to get involved in syria militarily [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3041.9s)]
*  um the the other and again the other thing on the foot stomp is [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3047.82s)]
*  I also think [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3051.5800000000004s)]
*  You know, this is not a scorecard, you know part of what I hate watching twitter around now tommy is like [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3053.02s)]
*  It's like this is a a take scorecard or now or now it's a geopolitical chess piece like this is a human [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3059.98s)]
*  story for syrians above all and [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3067.74s)]
*  I just think the fact that they're the ones who did this rather than it being like some [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3070.86s)]
*  Thinktankers in dc who think that they did it? [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3075.16s)]
*  That's to the good because ultimately that that creates a more legitimate transition in syria [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3078.46s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's really well said. Um, I I yeah like you I look back on those decisions [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3084.78s)]
*  Mistakes we made think about them all the time [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3092.3s)]
*  On top of that [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3095.58s)]
*  There was just sort of like the broader sweep of things the u.s had taken on by that time including a surge in afghanistan [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3096.22s)]
*  A war in libya that was not going great, etc, etc [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3102.22s)]
*  So there's a million different ways you can kind of look at the mistakes we made or didn't make ultimately [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3105.74s)]
*  This is about human beings in the syrian people and the fact that there are [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3110.7s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of people who are sitting in rotting in prisons who are now free or who know, you know [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3117.02s)]
*  The fate of their loved ones, even if it's the worst case there's millions of people abroad who have the opportunity to come home [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3121.8999999999996s)]
*  But there is so much more work to do to make sure that [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3128.54s)]
*  this story ends [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3131.5s)]
*  Hopefully and with a state that you know supports and represents the interests of those people and not another set of [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3133.34s)]
*  kleptocrats or or autocrats who are you know brutalizing another generation of syrians? Yeah. Yeah [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3142.04s)]
*  That's that's the opportunity here. Um, I mean and and just better, you know again, it doesn't have to be perfect but [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3149.5s)]
*  But uh boy can get so much better than it's been for these people for decades and that that's a truly hopeful thing [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3155.34s)]
*  Yeah, well a truly historic day [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3160.94s)]
*  Um, I think that's all I had that I don't know. There's anything else you wanted to say [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3163.34s)]
*  I mean maybe one last fuck you to bashar al-assad [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3166.78s)]
*  His father was a an evil monster who took power in a military coup and and uh, I think it was you know, the 70s [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3170.1400000000003s)]
*  He didn't even want bashar to lead his older brother was supposed to lead he got killed in a car accident [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3178.38s)]
*  So he said okay come back from london you optimologist nerd and let me teach you the ways of massacring civilians [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3182.94s)]
*  And and here we are, but I hope he lives a very brief and awful life in russia [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3189.34s)]
*  Yeah, I mean he's he's a terrible asshole. Um who? [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3193.5s)]
*  Did nothing for his people other than slaughter them? [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3198.46s)]
*  Uh, and and you know, I I don't know how long it'll be until you know, he might have an accident on a balcony in moscow [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3201.1000000000004s)]
*  Or something [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3207.6600000000003s)]
*  But he's definitely in a worse place in business to be there my final thought [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3208.94s)]
*  No, putin's pissed at him, right? [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3211.9s)]
*  Because like putin must be like you stupid fucker you had one job [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3213.02s)]
*  Which is keep an eye on your armed forces and don't let this happen [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3215.82s)]
*  I've been propping your pathetic ass for a decade now you give me now you have served no value to me [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3219.18s)]
*  And i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna keep you up in a lavish lifestyle forever. Like no [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3224.94s)]
*  I think you're right. Like there's a chance he suffers a yeah [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3228.86s)]
*  And and just think about putin too. I mean this guy was you know for for the last 13 years [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3232.62s)]
*  This was his proof that he was a strategic genius and this was this, you know key, you know foot [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3238.62s)]
*  Foot hold for the russians in the middle east and that's all gone now [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3244.14s)]
*  I mean, that's just money burnt. That's the turn out. He wasn't the grand chess master, you know [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3247.42s)]
*  All along and that's the last thing I was gonna say to me is it reminder? [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3254.2200000000003s)]
*  That things can change fast, you know in these kleptocratic autocracies [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3258.46s)]
*  You know, we sit here and you know, try to game out how long they're last [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3263.5800000000004s)]
*  If this can happen in syria, it can happen. I mentioned egypt, but it could happen in russia, you know, we we don't know [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3267.1800000000003s)]
*  Nobody predicted that the soviet union would fall as fast as it did [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3273.42s)]
*  And and so I think we've gotten yet another reminder that for all the difficulties democracy has had [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3276.94s)]
*  Ultimately people would rather not live under assholes like bashar al-assad [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3281.8s)]
*  And and ultimately [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3286.6200000000003s)]
*  Justice comes to a lot of those guys [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3288.3s)]
*  Amen. Well, uh, that's it for this bonus episode [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3290.54s)]
*  Thanks everybody for for tuning in and we'll be back regular scheduled on wednesday. I wonder what regime will topple by then [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3293.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, what you know south korea maybe yeah, we'll see [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3299.42s)]
*  All right. See you buddy. See you [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesV2LfpLNA&t=3302.86s)]
