# Trump’s New Immigration Policy: White South Africans Welcomed, Afghan Refugees Terminated
**Pod Save the World:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU)
*  As listeners know, there's been a horrible sea change in immigration policy under Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=0.0s)]
*  We recently learned today or yesterday that the Department of Homeland Security is terminating [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=4.8s)]
*  temporary protected status for people here from Afghanistan. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=8.96s)]
*  That means 9,000 Afghans could be deported back to the Taliban regime. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=12.52s)]
*  These are presumably people that helped the United States military during the two decades [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=17.740000000000002s)]
*  of war there. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=21.78s)]
*  So it's truly disgraceful. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=22.78s)]
*  There was a report the administration was planning to send migrants to Libya. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=25.38s)]
*  Hard to imagine a less safe place. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=30.66s)]
*  Luckily, a judge blocked that plan. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=32.019999999999996s)]
*  But the administration is having talks with officials in Rwanda about sending migrants [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=33.84s)]
*  from the US there. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=37.58s)]
*  Thank you, Boris Johnson and the Tory party in the UK for that terrible idea. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=38.58s)]
*  At the same time, the US, though, is welcoming, quote unquote, refugees from South Africa, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=42.620000000000005s)]
*  as long as they're white. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=49.46s)]
*  Here's Trump talking about what's happening in South Africa and why he's welcoming these [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=50.82s)]
*  folks here from earlier this week. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=55.46s)]
*  It's a genocide that's taking place that you people don't want to write about. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=58.02s)]
*  But it's a terrible thing that's taking place. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=61.76s)]
*  And farmers are being killed. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=63.78s)]
*  They happen to be white. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=68.26s)]
*  But whether they're white or black makes no difference to me. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=70.02s)]
*  But white farmers are being brutally killed and their land is being confiscated in South [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=73.1s)]
*  Africa. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=78.86s)]
*  To be clear, there is not a genocide against white farmers in South Africa. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=80.1s)]
*  South Africa is a very, very violent country. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=84.02s)]
*  Many farmers live in the middle of nowhere. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=86.46s)]
*  They're at risk from violence because the cops can't get to them easily if you live [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  in the rural farm. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=91.22s)]
*  But there's no data or evidence to suggest that this is a systematic racial thing, let [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=92.22s)]
*  alone a genocide. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  Also, white South Africans are far better off financially than black South Africans. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=97.46s)]
*  White people are about 7% of the population, but they own between two thirds and three [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=101.74s)]
*  quarters of the land in South Africa. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=105.5s)]
*  They are exponentially wealthier on average than black South Africans. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=108.12s)]
*  We should also just be honest. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  Like we're talking about the descendants of colonial settlers that set up the apartheid [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=113.96000000000001s)]
*  system and government actions that are now trying to create a bit of equality for black [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=118.28s)]
*  people who are just brutally oppressed. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=125.14s)]
*  I'm not suggesting that means these white farmers should be subjected to violence or [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=127.4s)]
*  any kind of harm. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=131.96s)]
*  But the fact that they're getting special treatment by the US as refugees, given the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=133.4s)]
*  history is pretty disgraceful. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=137.64s)]
*  I remember you and I talked about this in 2018 because Trump started tweeting about [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=140.55999999999997s)]
*  it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=145.95999999999998s)]
*  He saw a segment on Tucker Carlson about white genocide against South African farmers. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=146.95999999999998s)]
*  He demanded Mike Pompeo do an investigation that resulted in nothing because there was [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=151.95999999999998s)]
*  nothing to do or investigate. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=155.48s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=157.76s)]
*  It's just like, I've just been thinking about what an immigration policy that is this overtly [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=158.76s)]
*  racist message that sends to the world. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=164.28s)]
*  This is a really important story and I'm glad it got a lot of attention. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=168.92s)]
*  I hope it continues to get attention because it kind of gives away the whole game. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=171.88s)]
*  First of all, if on its face, their argument for air lifting these white farmers from South [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=175.96s)]
*  Africa, their argument is an argument for why there should actually be a refugee program. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=184.0s)]
*  In other words, if Trump is legitimately concerned about people facing threats of violence and [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=189.44s)]
*  political persecution, there are about nine million communities around the world that [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=193.72s)]
*  you would put ahead of these white South Africans. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=198.68s)]
*  By the way, at the top of that list would be Afghans who, if they get sent back to Afghanistan, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=200.68s)]
*  could be disappeared by the fucking Taliban. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=205.4s)]
*  The first thing is, it's completely absurd on its face. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=207.92s)]
*  If you actually cared about what Trump said, going down the list, people from Sudan, people [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=213.48s)]
*  from Afghanistan, people from, unfortunately, a lot of Myanmar, all manner of places. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=218.96s)]
*  It also bears saying that the Afghans who came in under TPS, like some of the other [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=227.88s)]
*  people that had TPS revoked, did not come in illegally. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=231.68s)]
*  They were following what they thought were the rules under their temporary protection [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=235.32s)]
*  status. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=239.52s)]
*  All that said, I think what's important here is it gives away the game because it does [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=240.52s)]
*  the fundamental white supremacy that is embedded in the Trump project. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=244.62s)]
*  Look, I know it's not post George Floyd anymore, but how else do you explain a situation in [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=248.78s)]
*  which they want to send pretty much largely, if not exclusively, black and brown people [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=255.70000000000002s)]
*  to places like Libya and Rwanda while welcoming plain loads of white people from South Africa [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=262.26s)]
*  to the United States? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=267.46s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=268.46s)]
*  This is the Stephen Miller, Tucker Carlson worldview where we're going to reverse quote [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=269.46s)]
*  unquote great replacement. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=273.16s)]
*  We're going to push black and brown people out of this country and we're going to become [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=274.16s)]
*  the safe haven for white people. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=278.4s)]
*  This airlift of Elon Musk's from Africa is absolutely ridiculous. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=281.16s)]
*  It cuts a grunt. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=286.64s)]
*  Decades. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=287.64s)]
*  Maybe you think, Tommy, our former boss, Barack Obama, his father came to the United States [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=288.64s)]
*  in an airlift of students from Kenya that were coming here to be educated in the United [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=294.72s)]
*  States. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=299.24s)]
*  That's who we used to be. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=300.24s)]
*  You know, 60, 70 years ago, we've gone backward. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=302.0s)]
*  We've gone way backwards here. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=306.36s)]
*  And so I just think this isn't just like a kind of weird sideshow. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=308.72s)]
*  This is like pretty elemental to the project here. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=313.76s)]
*  And it's not even a dog whistle. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=316.72s)]
*  It's like a pretty, I don't even know. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=318.88s)]
*  It's just like a cry to his base. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=321.64s)]
*  Like, look, we're letting in the white people and we're kicking out the brown people. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=323.2s)]
*  And I don't know, like sometimes you got to call out what it is. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=327.0s)]
*  And this is a kind of white supremacist immigration policy. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=330.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's weird. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=333.12s)]
*  It's like dog whistle became the thing we would talk about all the time. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=334.12s)]
*  But it's you're right. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=337.28000000000003s)]
*  It's not a dog whistle. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=338.28000000000003s)]
*  It's it's a policy. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  It's a policy welcoming white people, sending black people to countries they were never [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=340.28000000000003s)]
*  from. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=345.28000000000003s)]
*  But also the language involved, like the term white genocide, far right propaganda, it was [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=346.28000000000003s)]
*  popularized by white separatists, literal neo-Nazi. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=352.04s)]
*  It's been used. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=356.20000000000005s)]
*  It was, you know, the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in 2017. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=357.44s)]
*  There were signs about white genocide. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=361.36s)]
*  The Tree of Life synagogue shooter talked about white genocide or the Great Replacement [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=363.44s)]
*  Theory. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=367.8s)]
*  Like it is a it's usually deeply anti-Semitic. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=368.8s)]
*  It's usually the Jews who are conducting the white genocide in these twisted right wing [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=371.68s)]
*  worldviews. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=376.84000000000003s)]
*  And these theories, this propaganda has been used to defend violence. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=378.04s)]
*  The president said saying it's like you can't kind of understate what a big deal that is. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=385.76000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. And it does make you wonder like who is in his ear about this. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=389.52000000000004s)]
*  Got to know. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=394.88s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of South Africans. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=395.76000000000005s)]
*  It's you, David Sacks. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=397.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=398.84000000000003s)]
*  Elon, Peter Thiel. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=399.20000000000005s)]
*  There's a whole the PayPal mafia is all. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=400.8s)]
*  I'm telling you, man, like the white South African, you know, international is nothing [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=402.48s)]
*  to sneer at. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=408.04s)]
*  I mean, like and they have their, you know, I mean, sins of the fathers don't always pass [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=408.92s)]
*  on, but sometimes they do. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=414.72s)]
*  And these are people that came out of apartheid, came out of their nostalgic for that. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=415.84000000000003s)]
*  You know, I mean, they used to complain about what happened. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=420.48s)]
*  I mean, yes, are there flaws in like land reduced redistribution and like Zimbabwe and [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=423.04s)]
*  South Africa? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=429.84000000000003s)]
*  Sure. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=430.48s)]
*  But to your point, I mean, Mandela, like they like held back them. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkN5ezWVrcU&t=430.84000000000003s)]
