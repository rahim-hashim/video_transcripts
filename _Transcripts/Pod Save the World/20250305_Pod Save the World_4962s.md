Video Description: Tommy Vietor and Ben Rhodes discuss the continued fallout from President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s disastrous White House meeting, including Europe’s attempt to come up with an alternative peace plan, Trump casually talking about regime change in Ukraine, and the giddy response from the Kremlin. They also discuss the potentially devastating economic consequences of Trump’s trade war with Canada, China, and Mexico, the grim death toll from DOGE destroying USAID, why the Trump administration helped Andrew Tate return to America, Israel blocking humanitarian aid to Gaza, and news from Panama, Venezuela, and Mexico. Then Ben speaks to Natasha Hall, Senior Fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, about the way geopolitics are affecting the establishment of a new government in Syria.

# Trudeau Slams Trump’s “Dumb” Trade War as Canada Strikes Back with Tariffs
**Pod Save the World:** [March 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ)

*  So we don't know if he's gonna like frogmarch Slensky out there and paddle him like a fraternity pledge [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=16.8s)]
*  Well, JD Vance chortles, you know, who knows that we could pull out a NATO. I don't know what's gonna happen. Yeah [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  III have to say that I [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=30.24s)]
*  Was just in my kids [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=34.56s)]
*  school [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=36.6s)]
*  because they're doing a unit on on understanding truth and [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=37.88s)]
*  I was taught and you're supposed to associate with like one of your jobs. So I was talking about like fact-checking [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=42.480000000000004s)]

*  and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  I was telling the story about in the first joint session Obama gave in 2009. We had this fact wrong [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=52.08s)]
*  We said that Americans invented the automobile which we didn't and it was like this big thing was just you probably remember this [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=58.36s)]

*  It's such a quaint [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=66.76s)]
*  idea [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=68.76s)]
*  That you actually used to be stressed [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=69.76s)]
*  I was like am I misleading these kids by telling them that you have to fact-check everything you say when the president states is [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=71.4s)]
*  Probably not gonna fact-check that address. I don't think they're fact-checkers at the White House. What a funny job to have [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=77.48s)]
*  Because some people know something you can doge there are actually people whose whole job it is to fact-check, you know speeches, right and [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=83.8s)]
*  I think it got doged. I am I would doge the hell out of the fact-checkers at the White House [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=89.8s)]
*  Yeah, and tonight Trump's gonna announce a military incursion to Canada or something. Yeah [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  Operation to take out Justin Trudeau [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  It's been a long week blonde. Not even a week since the last time we talked to Friday then today [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=102.12s)]
*  We're gonna cover [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=107.08000000000001s)]
*  You know the fallout from the disastrous [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=107.88000000000001s)]
*  Solinsky meeting with Trump on Friday and how Europeans are kind of trying to fill the breach here [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  We're gonna talk about the trade war. It seems to have arrived [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=114.8s)]
*  Although I just saw a clip from the Commerce Secretary saying the trade war could be over as soon as tomorrow [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=117.84s)]
*  So, I don't know but we're gonna talk about the the implications. We'll talk about [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=122.92s)]
*  The latest we've heard about the impact of all the cuts to USAID programs and how people are dying all over the world [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=127.24000000000001s)]
*  We'll talk about the Tate brothers [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=133.0s)]
*  Andrew Tate do you hear about Andrew Tate in your house as he infected? Yes his classroom [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=134.76s)]
*  Yeah, there's a little toxic masculinity that we hear about. Yeah, the actual worst of the worst [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=139.48s)]
*  We'll explain why he was allowed into the US then some news out of Gaza about the ceasefire and then a bucket of stories [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  Out of Latin America. There's some interesting news out of Panama, Mexico and Venezuela that we wanted to talk about [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=150.6s)]
*  So all we're skipping around the globe today all the places that Trump may, you know, go to war with [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=155.6s)]
*  Yeah, good. And then Ben you did our interview this week who we can hear [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=161.76s)]
*  We have a return to the pod from Natasha Hall. Excellent. Syria expert from CSS [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=164.76s)]
*  We talk about how the interim Syrian government is doing spend a lot of time on what Israel is doing in literally [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=170.67999999999998s)]
*  Invading Syria like that's something that happens like a big deal occupying huge amounts of territory and taking natural resources [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=177.67999999999998s)]
*  and then we do kind of a tour of all the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=184.2s)]
*  External players that are trying to basically screw up Syria's transition [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  Israel at the top that list obviously what's Turkey up to? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=191.39999999999998s)]
*  What's going on with the Kurds? But also the Russians are back in the picture nice [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=194.92s)]
*  and what I was trying to get my head around in this dizzying conversation super interesting people should hear about is it [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=198.72s)]
*  Israel apparently wants the Russians back in the picture and maybe [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=205.12s)]
*  Because Natasha's main point is that the sanctions are really screwing Syria [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=209.48s)]
*  They can't get any assistance because the US sanctions remain in place. Maybe [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  Getting close to Putin [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=216.84s)]
*  Maybe the way out of the penalty box the Americans. That's the world. That's where we're at in 2025 [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=218.68s)]
*  You should listen to it because it actually I learned a lot [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=224.64000000000001s)]
*  I mean we covered a lot in 20 minutes what a completely predictable problem, but a bizarre solution [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=227.56s)]
*  Yeah, never would have seen coming in the years. But yeah, Natasha's really really smart. I'm excited to listen to that [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=232.60000000000002s)]
*  Well, let's talk about [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  All things Ukraine for a minute. So there's been this flurry of diplomatic activity [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=239.4s)]
*  Since the disastrous Oval Office meeting last week between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the US [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=243.76000000000002s)]
*  The Trump administration has reportedly now suspended the shipment of additional weapons to Ukraine [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=250.88s)]
*  I think this is the money like the presidential drawdown authorities that have been appropriated by Congress previously [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=256.21999999999997s)]
*  Okay, so that comes on top of the basically de facto [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=262.12s)]
*  Armsale freeze to Ukraine that came from the foreign aid freeze because so much of that money goes to the State Department or some of [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=266.15999999999997s)]
*  The money goes to the State Department [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=271.84s)]
*  There were also a bunch of reports that the Pentagon has now denied [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=273.64s)]
*  That the US cyber command has was ordered to pause planning offensive cyber operations against Russia, so that's weird [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=276.96000000000004s)]
*  A little worrying. Yeah a little odd Reuters reported that Trump is working on a plan to ease sanctions on Russia [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=283.88s)]
*  little worrisome [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=289.92s)]
*  Little cart ahead of the horse and then you know [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=291.52000000000004s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Kremlin is just literally cheering for all of it [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=293.52000000000004s)]
*  Dmitry Peskov Putin spokesman said quote the new administration is rapidly changing all foreign policy configurations [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=296.04s)]
*  And quote a new one this largely coincides with our vision and quote [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=302.6s)]
*  Over the weekend 18 European leaders gathered in London for an emergency summit hosted by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=306.92s)]
*  Starmer committed to sending Ukraine more military support and you pushed others to follow suit [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=313.40000000000003s)]
*  France put forward a plan for a one-month ceasefire as a way to test whether Putin was acting in good faith spoiler alert [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=317.64000000000004s)]
*  He's not and then finally today before we started recording then [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=324.08000000000004s)]
*  Zelensky released a long message on Twitter that included a lot of the groveling that Trump allies have been demanding for days [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=327.92s)]
*  I'll read a bit of it to you [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=334.84000000000003s)]
*  My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=336.64s)]
*  To get a peace that lasts our meeting at the White House on Friday did not go the way it was supposed to be it [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=340.2s)]
*  Is regrettable that it happened this way it is time to make things right [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=345.12s)]
*  We would like future cooperation and communication to be constructive regarding an agreement on minerals and security [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=347.64s)]
*  Ukraine is ready to sign it anytime and in any convenient format [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=352.88s)]
*  There's some reports that the they may even sign the minerals deal sometime today [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=355.96000000000004s)]
*  Here's a clip of President Trump on Monday talking with reporters about all things Ukraine. I want to see it end fast. I [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=360.76s)]
*  Don't want to see this go on for years and years now [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=368.28000000000003s)]
*  President Zelensky supposedly made a statement today in AP. I'm not a big fan of AP [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=372.22s)]
*  So maybe it was an incorrect statement, but he said he thinks the wars gonna go on for a long time [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=377.64s)]
*  And he better not be right about that. That's all [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=384.16s)]
*  Concerning to Americans that Russia Russia says that your administration's foreign policy is quote largely in line with their vision [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=387.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you what I think it takes two to tango and you're gonna have to make a deal with Russia and you're gonna [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=395.71999999999997s)]
*  Have to make a deal with Ukraine and the deal could be made very fast [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=400.96s)]
*  It should not be that hard a deal to make it could be made very fast now [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=404.12s)]
*  Maybe somebody doesn't want to make a deal and if somebody doesn't want to make a deal [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=408.08s)]
*  That person won't be around very long that person will not be listened to very long [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=412.04s)]
*  Because I believe that Russia wants to make a deal. I believe certainly the people of Ukraine want to make a deal [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=417.44s)]
*  They've suffered more than anybody else [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=423.48s)]
*  So then at the end there Trump seems to be suggesting regime change Mike Waltz said something similar over the weekend [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=425.4s)]
*  Kind of amazing that in response to a question about the Kremlin loving his foreign policy Trump then floats getting rid of Zelensky [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=431.71999999999997s)]
*  Which is right at the top of the news list. Yeah. Yeah [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=438.08s)]
*  first of all [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=442.36s)]
*  Not the most important thing in that clip [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=443.56s)]
*  But for someone who truths and tweets as much as he does [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=445.12s)]
*  He doesn't seem to understand that a statement that the Associated Press covers is [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=448.68s)]
*  Associated Press, so let's put this side these guys not that smart [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=453.0s)]
*  among other things [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=458.32s)]
*  Where to begin? I mean look we cover this a few days ago [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=460.52s)]
*  But the fact that he's still you know, they came back and clearly in a coordinated fashion [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=464.92s)]
*  Push this regime change point right because Waltz was saying it on a Sunday show [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=470.08000000000004s)]
*  This is not like something they're saying by accident [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=473.84000000000003s)]
*  and it's just absolutely extreme and we have to point out that the [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=476.04s)]
*  Trump administration's response to Zelensky's country getting invaded and Zelensky like heroically [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=480.52000000000004s)]
*  Marshaling his own people in the world in defense of his country that they think the regime change needs to be there [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=486.2s)]
*  Remember Joe Biden made that fuck up when at the end of his speech he called for Putin to go [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=493.48s)]
*  Well now we're just regularly calling for the democratically elected leader of a country [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=498.0s)]
*  It's been invaded to get out of the way so that Russia can dictate the terms of Ukraine surrender. That's what's happening [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=502.6s)]
*  That's where we're at. I [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=508.48s)]
*  Think the headline for me the last few days though is I actually was impressed [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=510.92s)]
*  You know, we're such Debbie Downers here these days, but I thought the Europeans reacted. Well, they're trying [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=515.84s)]
*  And actually if you want to compare them to the Democratic Party [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=521.36s)]
*  They seem to understand Trump better than the Democratic Party [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=524.64s)]
*  Leadership does at times which is that this is for real. This is happening [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=528.4799999999999s)]
*  This is not a drill and so you saw them immediately online [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=532.4s)]
*  Post their support for Ukraine. They didn't care whether or not Trump wasn't gonna like that [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=536.7199999999999s)]
*  They just all did it in unison. And so there was strength in numbers. That's one lesson. Like if they all go together [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=540.78s)]
*  Yeah [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=546.0s)]
*  It's harder for Trump to attack them when you have like 25 European leaders [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=546.5s)]
*  Expressing full support for Zelensky and then how about a good moment for Keir Starmer, you know who you know [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=550.32s)]
*  He's taken some slings and arrows but for him to kind of take this leadership role bringing everybody to London [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=555.3000000000001s)]
*  Having that show of solidarity for Ukraine having some pretty tangible announcements [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=561.2800000000001s)]
*  So in case people didn't follow they they they're providing billions in additional assistance to Ukraine [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=564.9200000000001s)]
*  They're using by leveraging the frozen Russian assets as kind of the backstop for these loans to Ukraine [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=570.62s)]
*  You saw Germany [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=576.96s)]
*  The Mertz [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=578.96s)]
*  You know Chancellor-elect [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=580.96s)]
*  To be yeah get together with Schultz and make these decisions to essentially do away with their cap on how much they can spend [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=583.12s)]
*  Relative to the deficit so they could spend more on defense [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=590.6800000000001s)]
*  And infrastructure that could make them less dependent on Russia [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=593.6s)]
*  So you're seeing in you saw obviously the French and the British kind of reiterating their commitment to a potential security force [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=596.2800000000001s)]
*  It's European a coalition of the willing probably not the most fortunate phrase [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=602.2800000000001s)]
*  Here summer is that the phrase coalition the willing to support Ukraine and I'll say minute [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=607.2s)]
*  I think it's important that [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=612.28s)]
*  Starmer and the French are doing this on kind of an ad hoc basis because it does seem like Victor Orban and hungry [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=613.24s)]
*  They're gonna start blocking more [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=618.24s)]
*  Military support to Ukraine in the EU, which is a problem [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=620.64s)]
*  Yeah [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=623.76s)]
*  No, I mean we talked about this a few weeks ago that they're gonna have to move this decision-making outside the EU so that Victor [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=624.12s)]
*  Orban can't come up the works, but you know you saw pretty quickly [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=629.96s)]
*  The Europeans kind of come together behind a plan [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=633.72s)]
*  Where they're gonna be the security backstop for the Ukrainians [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=637.0400000000001s)]
*  They're gonna ramp up their own defense production for their own purposes and to be able to provide assistance to Ukraine [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=640.0s)]
*  That's not gonna make whole the Ukrainians in the you know medium term. I mean the the danger for the Ukrainians is in a few months [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=645.32s)]
*  They're gonna be feeling the impact of that US weapons cutoff. Yeah, and the Europeans can't ramp things up fast enough to make make that good [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=653.44s)]
*  But at least gives Ukraine a much more credible position at the negotiating table to have all of Europe essentially standing behind them saying [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=660.86s)]
*  We have their backs in the long run. We're ramping up assistance. We're ramping up military production [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=668.5s)]
*  We're willing to put troops on the ground in Ukraine like so, you know, I do not think it was Trump's [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=673.46s)]
*  Three-dimensional chest to get the Europeans to spend more money on defense. I think it's the opposite [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=680.66s)]
*  I think the Europeans are like we can no longer count the United States. They're not our security guarantee anymore [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=684.9s)]
*  We have to be our own security guarantee and we have to have our own Ukraine policy [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=689.4200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and and I think starmer McCrone more than anybody else and Mertz I have to say stepping up to is bringing that together [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=692.98s)]
*  It's pretty hot and Maloney was there like so, you know, you had the kind of less Putin friendly far-right, you know showing up [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=700.22s)]
*  So yeah, it's good. I don't show it doesn't sound like the Italians want to put provide they do but she has been [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=706.6s)]
*  Rhetorically in a better place than you would think. I don't know if you saw JD Vance's interview on Sean Haney about the Zelensky meeting [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=711.6600000000001s)]
*  Unfortunately, I saw some of it he was like giddy [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=718.3399999999999s)]
*  He's still like he's so happy to have been allowed to talk at the at the big boy meeting and he also parodied Trump's [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=721.06s)]
*  Line that it was great TV [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=726.5799999999999s)]
*  which it's been a lot of [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=728.16s)]
*  Conversations since the meeting about whether it was a setup or a trap or this like I kind of the more I thought about [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=729.8199999999999s)]
*  The more it's like it's not that black and white [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=735.02s)]
*  I think like Trump and JD Vance they want to put on a show for their domestic political reasons [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=737.02s)]
*  And then Zelensky has his own politics and he just couldn't acquiesce to everything Trump was saying [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=741.9s)]
*  It's what led to this collision [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=746.54s)]
*  But like in the days now we've watched sort of the news cycle in the days since it's clear that Trump [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=748.26s)]
*  He wasn't offended. He wasn't upset. They're thrilled at how this is playing out. Well, I mean there's a couple of things [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=753.98s)]
*  I look at I mean one [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=760.06s)]
*  They what was interesting to me is they genuinely don't like [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=763.02s)]
*  democracies, you know [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=768.86s)]
*  I mean [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=770.02s)]
*  That's the only consistent thing and all of Trump's comments JD Vance's comments if you are a liberal democracy [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=770.46s)]
*  You're gonna be in for it. And so Zelensky they don't like for you know [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=777.7s)]
*  A lot of reasons which talked about last time including he has actually shown personal courage in a way that JD Vance has certainly never done [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=781.9s)]
*  and [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=789.42s)]
*  At the same time Tommy, I don't know like I noticed that the day of the meeting [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=790.9s)]
*  It was like an authoritarian dictate went out because every Trump cabinet secretary was like tweeting [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=797.0999999999999s)]
*  Thank you. President Trump for showing like the greatest leadership I've ever seen including cabinet officials who have nothing to do with Ukraine and [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=803.78s)]
*  That suggests a little concern, right? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=811.4599999999999s)]
*  I mean, you know when when you have to keep telling everybody how great you are [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=814.5799999999999s)]
*  You you might think that that might not have gone down. Well, but I think there's them pouring gasoline on a fire [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=817.8199999999999s)]
*  Okay, well, I mean like it could be no no you're you know what you're probably right I mean [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=823.7600000000001s)]
*  Common thread in the Trump years is whatever the worst explanation is probably right one and you're probably right that they that they feel great [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=828.6400000000001s)]
*  about it, I just [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=835.4000000000001s)]
*  What what they did serve to do though is just to reinforce the core point that we made the other day [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=838.36s)]
*  which is it this is an absolute transformation of US foreign policy and an [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=843.8800000000001s)]
*  Absolute alignment of the United States with Russia and its view of the Ukraine conflict in its view of Europe [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=848.8000000000001s)]
*  In its view of democracy itself and the more JD Vance talks the more he just reinforces that and there's a through line [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=854.32s)]
*  to him [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=861.24s)]
*  endorsing the AFD in Germany [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=862.6400000000001s)]
*  You know beating up the Zelensky in the Oval Office doing victory laps in Shanghai [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=865.24s)]
*  This is guy that does not like democracy [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=869.24s)]
*  Do you see that he went to Vermont for a ski trip and people protested him and they were holding up signs [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=871.6s)]
*  It said JD Vance skis and jeans [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=876.32s)]
*  Also, I like I don't think enough is being made about the fact that [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=880.32s)]
*  Zelensky did that whole press conference in English, which I meant like imagine doing a 45 minute [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=884.48s)]
*  Fight with the White House press corps in the president United States in English when that's not you know [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=892.1600000000001s)]
*  The your first language and he was repeatedly turning to his translator and asking for guidance [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=896.8000000000001s)]
*  I don't like what we'll see what the followed is [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=900.96s)]
*  I mean Marine Le Pen of all people condemned the brutality of suspending [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=902.96s)]
*  Yeah, I mean when when the the French far-right which has its own fascist roots is is a little put off Nigel Farage [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=906.48s)]
*  Yeah was attacking the JD Vance. I thought that clip might have been AI. I was so shocked. Yeah [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=914.12s)]
*  Yeah, so if they've lost Marine Le Pen and Nigel Farage like that's how far right our government is in this [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=919.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's getting weird and this is going to I mean we should just name like this is changing [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=925.6800000000001s)]
*  The way people view the United States of America all over the world and [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=931.04s)]
*  You know, I remember was like to go to Europe right after the Iraq war started wasn't that fun [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=936.2399999999999s)]
*  you know, I [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=942.3599999999999s)]
*  Always try to say that people need to separate the people from their governments [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=944.4399999999999s)]
*  I hope people can do that with Americans, but it's hard to do that when Americans elected this guy knowing full well [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=948.9599999999999s)]
*  What was coming? He's real dickhead [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=954.16s)]
*  I think the thing to watch is whether Elon Musk ends up cutting off Starlink access to Ukrainians because you see these reports from soldiers being [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=955.64s)]
*  Like we can figure out how to deal with like fewer, you know shells or artillery or whatever [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=963.12s)]
*  But like losing Starlink would mean they don't have [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=968.24s)]
*  Communications tools. They don't have coordination ability. They don't have drone operations. Those won't work anymore. So that'd be a huge deal [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=971.36s)]
*  Last thing on this bench. Thank you to everybody who listened to the bonus episode [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=977.96s)]

*  Conveniently overlooking the fact that there have also been tens of thousands of American troops in South Korea ever since [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1011.56s)]
*  Seemed to not fully understand what he's waiting into there [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1016.8s)]

*  But your government has chosen to do this to you [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1285.8s)]
*  As of this morning [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1292.32s)]
*  Markets are down and inflation is set to rise dramatically all across your country [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1294.68s)]
*  Now it's not in my habit to agree with the Wall Street Journal [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1300.8s)]
*  But Donald they point out that even though you're a very smart guy [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1305.04s)]
*  This is a very dumb thing to do [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1310.24s)]
*  Strong there from Trudeau. I like I like pissy Trudeau. I did this is great. Yeah, yeah a little context [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1313.8200000000002s)]
*  I'm still white translator for today [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1320.0600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, a little bit of context just to help explain why you so pissed [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1322.0600000000002s)]
*  So the North American tariffs are ostensibly about pressuring Mexico and Canada to do more to stop migration and stop fentanyl [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1325.02s)]
*  Trafficking into the US but southern border border crossings are way down like way way way way down in part [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1330.8200000000002s)]
*  These Mexico sent 10,000 troops to the border [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1337.26s)]
*  And according to US Customs and Border Patrol only [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1339.74s)]
*  0.2% of all seizures of fentanyl entering the US are made at the Canadian border [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1344.02s)]
*  So this is a made-up problem to begin with but despite that fact [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1348.3s)]
*  When Trump first raised this in the threatened tariffs a few months ago [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1351.5s)]
*  Canada took a bunch of additional steps to limit fentanyl trafficking including appointing a fentanyl czar [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1355.58s)]
*  they're going to invest like 200 million dollars in combating gangs traffic fentanyl and [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1360.4199999999998s)]
*  according to [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1365.02s)]
*  Authorities less than half an ounce of fentanyl was seized crossing the Canadian border in January [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1366.5s)]
*  So it's all working pretty well and then Mexico there Mexico is also promised to retaliate [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1371.38s)]
*  We're not sure how yet [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1376.18s)]
*  So of the Chinese with the Chinese Foreign Ministry tweeting if war is what the US wants be at a tariff war a trade war or [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1377.26s)]
*  Any other type of war we're ready to fight till the end [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1384.38s)]
*  Yikes any other type of work kind of got my attention me too. I didn't need coffee this morning after I read that [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1387.38s)]
*  Yes, sometimes there's a method of Trump's madness on trade I genuinely don't really get the endgame here you have any thoughts [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1393.54s)]
*  This is pure dumb fuckery. I do have thoughts about the endgame [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1400.62s)]
*  First of all, let's note that in the same way that Trump, you know [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1405.18s)]
*  Yes, Zalansky and Trudeau have in common that they're leaders of democracies Trump doesn't like democracies [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1408.3799999999999s)]
*  he doesn't like Zalansky because Zalansky actually has [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1413.62s)]
*  Physical and personal courage which Donald Trump does not he doesn't like Justin Trudeau because Justin Trudeau is much better looking than him [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1417.3s)]
*  You know, I truly believe that's like part of the guy. He's a very handsome man. I just say [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1423.16s)]
*  Let's go through this. So first of all [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1428.64s)]
*  To your point the Canadian angle this has never made any sense because you could at least [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1431.1200000000001s)]
*  Think that okay these terrorists are pressuring Mexico to try to stop border crossings. That is not a problem at the northern border [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1437.64s)]
*  Anybody's driven across that border. No, it's like a very orderly place [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1444.68s)]
*  You know, there's not like fentanyl streaming across the border and this is really dumb [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1447.92s)]
*  And just to give people a sense of what this is gonna do to your costs [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1452.16s)]
*  63% of US vegetables come from Mexico, right? That's your groceries. Those prices are going to go up [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1456.8000000000002s)]
*  60% of crude oil imports United States come from Canada. That's going to make gas prices go up [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1463.8000000000002s)]
*  Particularly in the Midwest particularly in Trump country where they refine a lot of the Canadian crude the US automobile industry [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1471.8000000000002s)]
*  Kind of operates wholly on supply chains different parts and things that flow in from Mexico and Canada [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1479.28s)]
*  And so the price of a car is going to go up dramatically and the US auto industry [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1485.6599999999999s)]
*  saved by Barack Obama is [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1491.56s)]
*  potentially going to suffer a huge harm relative to their competitors because the cost of just making a car in the United States can go [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1494.32s)]
*  Way up because of what Trump did that's just a little bit of the economic [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1500.0s)]
*  Impact this could have and look if Trump, you know calls it off in two days because the market [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1504.36s)]
*  I mean what people should watch is Trump sometimes does seem to respond to the stock market [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1510.1599999999999s)]
*  It's like one of the only things it's a check on his behavior headlines and stocks [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1514.6399999999999s)]
*  But I don't even know what victory he's gonna claim because there's nothing left for Canada to do member [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1518.32s)]
*  they appointed like the fentanyls are and they [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1523.24s)]
*  You know pledged on a billion dollars to stop fentanyl when they're not even anything to stop [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1526.3999999999999s)]
*  Which leads me to you know, Trudeau said this a few times and he said it again today he said [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1532.1200000000001s)]
*  That he thinks Trump's goal is to wreck the Canadian economy so he can annex Canada. I [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1537.4s)]
*  Take that really seriously, you know, I mean, I don't think Trudeau is being hyperbolic there [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1543.8s)]
*  He's dealt with Trump for a long time now and there's no other rationale to me about why he's fucking with Canada so hard [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1547.64s)]
*  I I'm telling you I've been doing deep reading in history [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1553.68s)]
*  These guys like they territorial expansion becomes the game for these aging autocrats and [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1556.96s)]
*  It explains why you would also run the bus over [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1562.92s)]
*  Zelensky to normalize Russia annexing 20% of Ukraine like whether it's Greenland or Panama or Canada [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1566.64s)]
*  You know this repetition of Governor Trudeau. It's it's kind of not funny and [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1574.28s)]
*  Dickish but like he seems to like really have something in mind [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1579.3200000000002s)]
*  For Canada and and that that should worry people. I don't think we're gonna get there tomorrow [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1585.44s)]
*  But I mean four years of Trump like God only it's been less than two months people like [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1589.6s)]
*  You have to use your imagination of where this thing could be in three years and it's not [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1594.3999999999999s)]
*  Inconceivable to me that he actually has territorial designs on Canada's not inconceivable. I think it'd be wildly unpopular [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1598.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, oh, yeah, I put this at a low probability [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1605.0s)]
*  You know like single digits, but just the fact that it's not an insane thing [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1607.68s)]
*  For the Canadian Prime Minister to say maybe this is what's going on that shows you the the kind of error that we're currently [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1611.92s)]
*  Also shows you how it's being received in Canada [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1617.5200000000002s)]

*  Smooth Holly, I was doing a lot of tariff reading. I love a good tariff reading [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1664.0s)]
*  so we're as you guys know trying to keep a handle on the damage from the [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1667.84s)]
*  Gutting of USAID it's gonna take years to assess the full damage [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1673.48s)]
*  But you know [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1677.92s)]
*  It is no exaggeration to say that right now people are dying because of these doge cuts to USAID [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1678.8s)]
*  The New York Times published a piece last week listing some of the thousands of programs hit by [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1684.52s)]
*  The cuts among them are projects that vaccinate children from polio [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1689.78s)]
*  Conduct Ebola contact tracing and provide the only source of water for a quarter of million people displaced in the Democratic Republic of Congo [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1693.82s)]
*  The global drug facility. It's the world's largest source of tuberculosis medicine [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1700.4199999999998s)]
*  It supplied TB meds for three million people including 300,000 children. They have had their whole operation [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1705.1799999999998s)]
*  operational budget wiped out in Nigeria [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1711.82s)]
*  60,000 kids under five are at immediate risk of death due to the gutting of the malnutrition program the head of the Desmond Tutu [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1715.18s)]
*  HIV Foundation in South Africa [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1720.9s)]
*  predicts that a half a million people will die in the next ten years because the organizations that treat them have lost their grants [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1722.7s)]
*  There are just too many programs and stats to name here Ben [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1729.18s)]
*  But when you see Elon Musk claim that no one has died or no one will die just realize how brazenly [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1731.94s)]
*  Dishonest that man is no that's just a lie because it stands to reason if you're giving life-saving [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1738.94s)]
*  Nutritional assistance to people and a famine in Sudan if you're giving life-saving drugs to people in places like South Africa [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1744.34s)]
*  And you stop giving those things to those people they will die [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1750.7s)]
*  There's no they are dying people have already died because of Doge and many many more people we see many [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1753.92s)]
*  We're talking potentially millions of people will die because of this and the other piece of this that I think people don't fully appreciate is [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1759.02s)]
*  USAID [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1766.18s)]
*  Imperfect as it was and you know [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1767.94s)]
*  We'll have to build a new and better development agency under the next Democratic president [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1770.1s)]
*  was a force multiplier because they would give a [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1775.26s)]
*  Certain amount of funding that kind of allowed for an organization to grow around that funding right and and so you know other [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1779.1s)]
*  Philanthropies or other countries would kind of come on on top of USAID and it's convo rug pull and to use the phrase [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1786.9399999999998s)]
*  We're using a lot on this pod where if you remove the USAID funding those organizations collapse [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1793.02s)]
*  And so you lose not just a USAID funding you you you lose the other funding that went into that organization on top of USAID [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1799.34s)]
*  Also because of the Europeans needing to ramp up their right defense spending they're cutting their development budget. So the Brits [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1806.3799999999999s)]
*  Said that they're gonna basically find the savings in their development budget to fund their their military [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1814.8999999999999s)]
*  Which is because of a Trump demands because of a Trump's a starmer wanted to go to the White House and be able to deliver to [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1819.74s)]
*  Trump a tiny but a an increase in defense spending [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1824.84s)]
*  Yeah, so this is gonna ripple out [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1828.54s)]
*  I know a lot of people that run kind of small NGOs that rely on USAID funding those NGOs might go under [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1830.42s)]
*  Because of the withdrawal of USAID funding and again that means that you're losing more than just the USAID impact [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1835.98s)]
*  it's gonna kind of [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1842.5s)]
*  Reverberate for years through the kind of global development and philanthropic community and real people are gonna die real people are gonna suffer [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1844.1s)]
*  There's me more instability. There's gonna be more disease [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1850.74s)]
*  More things more migration of people by the way [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1854.22s)]
*  Like all the things that Trump says he wants to stop all the people who work locally for these [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1856.96s)]
*  Organizations in these afflicted parts of the world suddenly are out of a job and have nothing to do [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1860.42s)]
*  I mean, it's it's and they're like the best people, you know, it's it's hard [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1864.2s)]
*  Yeah, the the mind share we're losing and also, you know [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1867.02s)]
*  This brings us to these memos that were written by a USAID employee named Nicholas Enrich [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1870.02s)]
*  So until recently he was the acting administrator for global health [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1874.3000000000002s)]
*  He wrote a couple memos kind of laying out the barriers put in place to actually implement these waivers [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1877.78s)]
*  That Marco Rubio said had been issued for life-saving programs [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1883.5s)]
*  But he says the issues in actually implementing the waiver came from quote the refusal to pay for assistance [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1886.9s)]
*  activities conducted or goods and services rendered the blockage and restriction of access to USAIDs payment systems followed by the creation of new and [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1892.42s)]
*  effective processes for payments the ever-changing guidance as to what qualifies as [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1899.98s)]
*  Life-saving and whose approval is needed and making that decision and most recently the sweeping termination to the most critical [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1904.3s)]
*  Implementing mechanisms necessary for providing life-saving services, but besides that is all going good Marco [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1910.98s)]
*  He specifically pinned the failures on quote political leadership that will no doubt result in preventable death [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1917.42s)]
*  destabilization and threats to national security on a massive scale and for his candor this man was put on leave [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1923.96s)]
*  Of course, of course out of the organization ProPublica also points out that the US government is refusing to pay about two billion dollars for work [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1929.98s)]
*  That was already provided by aid organizations [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1936.82s)]
*  So it's just like hard to think of a more perfectly Trumpian policy than stiffing humanitarian groups doing life-saving work [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1939.78s)]
*  For stuff they've already done [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1946.58s)]
*  Yeah, they're probably you know operating on a tight margin again, so they could put those people out of business [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1948.62s)]
*  I mean what all this shows you is there's this kind of [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1953.02s)]
*  combination of not caring and not understanding like they don't give a shit that what they're doing is gonna cause people to die and [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1957.06s)]
*  They also just don't even understand what they're cutting [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1966.3000000000002s)]
*  And actually, you know just following John's, you know back and forth with Elon on on on X [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1969.14s)]
*  You know, he wants to present it as oh, no, I'm actually gonna save that program [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1975.74s)]
*  It's like what he said, you know, we when we found out we stopped Ebola [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1980.64s)]
*  We turned it back as if that's like some great thing talk about the least fucking efficient thing in the world [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1983.0200000000002s)]
*  The efficient thing would be to not kill the program and to like look at this thing understand, you know first [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1988.14s)]
*  Yeah, understand it first and then select what you want to cut just like you it's massively inefficient to just cut everything [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=1993.46s)]
*  And then be like, oh shit [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2001.1000000000001s)]
*  We better have the Ebola people like someone go find them and rehire them like this is idiocy [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2002.64s)]
*  Masquerading as competence and it's cruel at its core. Yeah, and like these programs are complicated [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2009.5s)]
*  They're funded in weird ways like you're like why is HHS actually paying for this program that USAID administers? [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2015.06s)]
*  I don't like there's there's inefficiency. There's things we should change and streamline improve [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2021.18s)]
*  But the fact that Elon just like stormed in there with a bunch of 19 year olds who are fluent in like [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2026.9s)]
*  Using big data sets and AI and they decided they just under so that everything worked and they just destroyed it all and then try [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2032.8600000000001s)]
*  To piece it back together after just you're right [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2039.5s)]
*  It's like the height of stupidity [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2041.3s)]
*  And what they're gonna find out too is that there's billions of dollars goes to like American farmers to buy the food that we send [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2042.6200000000001s)]
*  So it's gonna screw a lot of Americans in that way [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2048.36s)]
*  You know what I always think of you you just mentioned David Sachs David Sachs does a podcast called the all-in podcast with some other [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2050.7200000000003s)]
*  Terrible people one of them this guy named Chamoff who infamously said that caring about the weaker genocide was below his line [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2055.88s)]
*  He just didn't care and it does seem like that mindset is just kind of permeated the entire US government now [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2063.4s)]
*  It's it's not just that you know, we can't do everything [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2069.76s)]
*  We're gonna have to be able to fund some things and not others [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2072.6800000000003s)]
*  It's like, you know what? I just don't give a shit. So it doesn't matter to me anything that doesn't enrich these guys is below the line [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2075.96s)]
*  Yeah, if you're not doing like a pump and dumps back, you don't care about it. Okay, let's talk about some other odious characters [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2081.68s)]
*  Similar not equally odious far more odious the Tate brothers [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2087.68s)]
*  So I guess half the audience is probably who are these guys the other half the kid the listeners who have teenage kids are like [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2091.28s)]
*  I fucking hate that guy. Yeah, so some context Andrew Tate is he's a former kickboxer turned social media influencer [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2098.48s)]
*  He says racist anti-semitic misogynistic things all the time on purpose [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2104.96s)]
*  Andrew and Tristan Tate were chart with rape and human trafficking by the Romanian government [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2110.16s)]
*  Andrew Tate has also been accused of battery and sexual assault by women in the UK [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2115.52s)]
*  Andrew Tate first broke into the mainstream in 2016 when he went on the British reality show Big Brother [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2119.96s)]
*  He got kicked off the show halfway through these British authorities were investigating him for rape allegations [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2124.84s)]
*  Andrew and his brother then started the webcam business which evolved into this national massive social media following and [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2130.58s)]
*  Videos featuring and you Tate have literally been viewed like tens of billions of times [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2137.3399999999997s)]
*  I think he was the most googled person for one month in 2022 [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2141.4s)]
*  So just massive following and they've parlayed that social media following and to creating these bullshit online [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2145.86s)]
*  Universities that sound like kind of like Trump University pyramid schemes [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2152.7799999999997s)]
*  He's also created kind of like retreats and seminars that are almost cult-like where like these men pay [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2156.18s)]
*  Thousands of dollars to fly to Romania to hang out with Andrew Tate and like fight each other and do all this weird shit [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2162.2599999999998s)]
*  There's this amazing vice documentary that's on YouTube came out a couple years ago [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2167.9799999999996s)]
*  If you want to go deeper this reporter [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2172.4399999999996s)]
*  literally like got in the ring and physically fought with some kickboxer as a way to like earn his way into [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2174.6s)]
*  more access to Tate's [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2181.06s)]
*  Events but anyway, so Andrew Tate has been kicked off of various social media sites [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2183.1s)]
*  But like nothing has dented his influence and popularity and the reason this matters is to be this guy is [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2187.62s)]
*  Massively popular with teenage boys you have teachers in the UK [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2193.22s)]
*  You've had to put together like specific programs to combat the proliferation of his views in British elementary and high schools [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2197.2s)]
*  There have been surveys that found 80% of British boys aged 16 to 17 had watched in Duterte videos [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2203.58s)]
*  There were similar surveys showing he had huge influence among Australian boys and on top of that [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2209.48s)]

*  And so despite all that context last month the Tate brothers were allowed to travel to the US [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2218.0s)]
*  The Romanian government reportedly lifted its travel ban on the Tates after pressure from the Trump administration [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2224.26s)]
*  Specifically from friend of the pod Rick Grinnell who apparently like rid road them to do this [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2230.92s)]
*  So Tate's a huge Trump fan [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2236.52s)]
*  The kind of reach around here is he says wonderful things about Donald all the time and attacks his opponents [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2238.56s)]
*  Trump claims to know nothing about his administration pressuring the Romanian government [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2244.48s)]
*  But like this is just another example of the way this man is just poisoning the culture [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2249.56s)]
*  And this is what America prioritizes around the world because nobody [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2254.7599999999998s)]
*  Outside the United States who's any familiarity with this case and with Ender Tate? [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2259.68s)]
*  Believes that Trump or like the Trump administration didn't make this happen the guy was no [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2264.22s)]

*  The you know, we don't talk that much about QAnon [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2347.82s)]
*  It's always like the people that are most on the nose as to what the QAnon people [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2350.86s)]
*  Say they're fighting who seem to become heroes [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2356.3s)]

*  Yeah out of prison who you know, maybe you could argue a sentence was too long [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2376.94s)]
*  But there was like the Silk Road which is this, you know early online site on the [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2381.02s)]
*  Like the tour network where you could buy all kinds of child pornography and drugs and like all the things that these sort of right-wing [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2385.54s)]
*  Maga types say they're trying to fight against. Yeah. Yeah, that's their idea of free speech, I guess but it's disgusting [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2393.3s)]
*  But yeah, it's good to know that our diplomatic [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2399.86s)]
*  Dollars are going towards well Rick Grinnell the acting president Kennedy Center to like among other hats that he wears there [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2402.5s)]
*  There's a rumor that Rick Grinnell might get tapped to play some sort of diplomatic role in you [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2409.1800000000003s)]
*  It's just cuz he's a troll. So Trump lets him troll around. He'll troll Ukraine. He'll troll, you know the arts in this country [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2415.42s)]
*  You'll troll people that don't like Andrew Tate like that's all Rick Grinnell. Yeah, it's good stuff. Any riches himself along the way [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2421.98s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure he's deals with Jared Kushner lots of cash with Jared Kushner [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2427.92s)]
*  Alright speaking of the sort of special representatives run around the world for Trump [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2431.82s)]
*  Let's talk about Gaza because on Sunday Israel stopped all humanitarian aid from going into Gaza in an effort to pressure Hamas into accepting revised [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2435.96s)]
*  ceasefire terms [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2444.02s)]
*  International aid groups the UN Arab countries Egypt cutter [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2445.78s)]
*  They all condemn the move but the White House supports it [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2448.58s)]
*  This comes after phase one of the Gaza ceasefire officially ended this past Saturday phase two was supposed to be negotiated during phase one [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2451.34s)]
*  But I don't think those talks ever even started [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2458.54s)]
*  No [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2460.42s)]
*  At least they never got off the ground [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2460.86s)]
*  In lieu of phase two Israel said it agreed to a different proposal that they said came from Steve Wittkopf [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2462.38s)]
*  Trump's Middle East envoy under Wittkopf's plan the ceasefire would continue for seven weeks until mid-april [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2467.82s)]
*  Through Ramadan and Passover half of the reigning hostages would be released on day one of the extension [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2473.46s)]
*  The other half when a permanent ceasefire agreement is reached Hamas refused to accept this deal [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2479.4s)]
*  They want to stick to the original framework not surprisingly those painstakingly negotiated [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2484.54s)]
*  So Israel has ramped up pressure on them by closing the crossings into Gaza in response Hamas said the decision to suspend [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2489.14s)]
*  Humanitarian aid is cheap blackmail a war crime and a blatant coup against the ceasefire agreement [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2496.26s)]
*  According to the BBC 4200 trucks a week had been going into Gaza now [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2501.26s)]
*  That number is zero and food prices are already spiking and things could get worse the Israeli public broadcaster Khan [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2504.66s)]
*  Reported that Netanyahu government has what they're calling a hell plan which entails cutting off water and electricity to Gaza [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2511.7400000000002s)]
*  displacing people again from the north [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2518.6200000000003s)]
*  and sending them to the south and [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2520.98s)]
*  Prepping to resume fighting so according to the Guardian Hamas is also prepping for a return to war [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2523.54s)]
*  By harvesting explosives from unexploded Israeli bombs to use as weapons so perfectly ominous perfect [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2528.98s)]
*  encapsulation of the [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2537.1000000000004s)]
*  One element of the stupidity of Israeli policy is that all that they dropped so many bombs that [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2539.98s)]
*  Their own bombs that were provided by the US will then be used against them [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2544.86s)]
*  I mean it just you can't encapsulate the the cycle of violence any clearer than that [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2548.14s)]
*  Yeah, I think we just need to be clear. There's so much happening in the world. This is a war crime, you know [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2553.58s)]
*  you you you cutting off all assistance to a you know besieged people is [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2559.94s)]
*  Against a national law like again and nobody seems to give a shit the court [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2564.9s)]
*  They would investigate that the ICC is being sanctioned by Trump [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2570.42s)]
*  So this is what it feels like to live in a world with no rules, you know [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2574.62s)]
*  For all of Joe Biden's many many many problems particularly on this issue [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2580.94s)]
*  At least six months ago people would have like paid attention to this now. It's like, oh, yeah, there are no rules Israel [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2585.9s)]
*  I mean, you know Israel right now is has invaded an occupied part of Syria and like Trump administration [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2592.14s)]
*  Fine with that they cut off all assistance to Gaza [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2599.34s)]
*  Like this is what a world without rules feels like we we we live in it fully now and Trump [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2602.06s)]
*  They just they just bypass Congress to send another four billion worth of weapons to Israel including thirty five thousand two thousand pound bombs [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2609.34s)]
*  I think I guess it's the shipments under the Trump administration to 12 billion total [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2617.02s)]
*  So again, like I yeah, I know that by the administration policy was terrible [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2622.1400000000003s)]
*  I am surprised at this point that there are no maybe once the fighting resumes there will be a series of protests again [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2625.46s)]
*  Well, it doesn't help that Trump like truth the other day that you know, he's gonna cut all funding to any school [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2632.7400000000002s)]
*  There's a protest and deport the people. So there's all this connects, you know, this is all I will I will say [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2638.7000000000003s)]
*  To the people that you know were [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2644.62s)]
*  okay with like, you know cracking down on those protests and like you [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2647.3799999999997s)]
*  Plowed some ground for this, you know, like here we are. This is what it feels like and it's not good [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2652.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah a couple big stories out of Latin America that we wanted to highlight [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2656.58s)]
*  So we've talked a couple times been about Trump's obsession with the Panama Canal. He claims the canal is controlled by China [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2659.5s)]
*  It's not controlled by a Panamanian government [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2665.22s)]
*  But for about 30 years two ports on either side of the canal have been owned by a Hong Kong based company called CK [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2667.98s)]
*  Hutchinson earlier today [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2673.74s)]
*  We learned that CK Hutchinson has agreed to a deal to sell over 40 ports to a consortium of buyers led by BlackRock [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2675.3399999999997s)]
*  It's a 23 billion dollar deal that includes two ports in Panama. So Ben reading about this did make me wonder if [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2682.2599999999998s)]
*  political pressure from Trump forced the deal to happen or [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2690.22s)]
*  If Trump knew this deal was in the works, which is why he started talking about it so we could take credit [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2693.66s)]
*  I don't know if I'm bringing too much red string to the broadcast [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2699.2s)]
*  Well, I mean look this is that what's so dumb about all this in the same way that the [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2701.22s)]
*  critical minerals from Ukraine are not really the game changer that Trump is casting them as I [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2707.14s)]
*  Don't think a Hong Kong based port management company no longer managing a couple of new stations on the Panama Canal [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2714.58s)]
*  Makes a shits bit of difference to anything in the world [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2722.62s)]
*  It's all just this kind of optics of like, you know [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2726.14s)]
*  Trump is getting the Chinese out of the Panama Canal when it's you know [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2729.3799999999997s)]
*  Just look at some port management company, which by the way probably made a lot of money in the BlackRock [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2732.98s)]
*  Do you look like CK Hutchinson is doing just fine? [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2737.68s)]
*  Yeah, I think yeah [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2741.18s)]
*  23b is fine. It's probably a little higher than they paid for the port, you know [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2743.2999999999997s)]
*  Maybe they did a couple of renovations like, you know to drive the valuation [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2746.9s)]
*  so just there's an absurdity to all this and [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2750.2599999999998s)]
*  nor do I think that this [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2753.3399999999997s)]
*  Will end his fixation the panel on canal and this is what leaders around the world need to get you give Trump [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2755.38s)]
*  His pound of flesh. He'll come back for more, you know, then he'll come back and say we want to operate the canal or we want [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2761.04s)]
*  to you know Americans not to pay to go through there and and so I [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2766.52s)]
*  You know, it's tough for panel because they're a small country [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2770.78s)]
*  But I don't think this is gonna reduce the degree to which he still [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2773.04s)]
*  Fancies the canal there. No, and also last week we talked about the US using Panama as a staging ground for deporting migrants [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2777.7400000000002s)]
*  We just want to flag that a group of lawyers have brought a case against Panama in front of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2784.9s)]
*  Arguing that Panama has violated the American Convention on Human Rights by detaining these migrants [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2792.58s)]
*  And then there's a specific argument around these ten Christian Iranian converts who should qualify for asylum [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2798.14s)]
*  Because they could be put to death for converting under Iranian law. So that that's sort of in the mix [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2805.62s)]
*  There's lots of legal challenges now happening to these [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2810.66s)]
*  Immigration measures put forward by Trump. Yeah, and well, you know in the end of day, of course, it won't be the US it suffers [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2813.8999999999996s)]
*  It'll be like Panama that suffers for just having to be dragged along with our inhumane [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2821.02s)]
*  Deportation pulse. Yeah [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2826.62s)]
*  also in the courts the Supreme Court is going to hear a case from Mexico this week about whether [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2827.8599999999997s)]
*  American gun companies can be held liable for cartel violence committed using their weapons [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2832.18s)]
*  So a Mexican authorities say 70 to 90 percent of guns found at crime scenes in the country are trafficked from America [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2836.72s)]
*  In total about 170 million dollars worth of guns are trafficked from the US to Mexico each year [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2843.3599999999997s)]
*  The case challenges decades of precedent involving the Second Amendment [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2848.8399999999997s)]
*  Federal law protects gun manufacturers from liability. Why it shouldn't oral arguments happened the morning of this recording [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2853.22s)]
*  And it looks bad for Mexico with both liberal and conservative justices questioning the validity of their argument [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2861.44s)]
*  But for more on the case check out this week's Monday's episode of our Supreme Court podcast Rick scrutiny [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2866.58s)]
*  But then you know, I read about this and I could imagine [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2872.5s)]
*  Claudia Shane bomb [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2875.86s)]
*  Saying I'm slapping tariffs on all US policies until the White House addresses the scourge of US guns [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2877.38s)]
*  Coming into Mexico. Yeah, I'll be completely valid [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2884.62s)]
*  Yeah [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2887.62s)]
*  The cartels just come in here and buy up a bunch of AR 15s and stuff totally legally and just take them across the border [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2887.98s)]
*  And that's how they arm themselves, you know [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2893.9s)]
*  it's not that complicated, I mean there's there's like a [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2895.9s)]
*  there's a sickness in the United States that [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2899.42s)]
*  You know people you do have to look at this country from the outside in I mean the [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2906.14s)]
*  the the Chinese, you know [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2912.54s)]
*  You very critical the Chinese Communist Party, but in that statement that we referenced earlier for instance [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2915.86s)]
*  They were kind of like guys like the fentanyl crisis is your crisis, you know [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2920.78s)]
*  Like they're not all these other countries with you know, there's something broken in your society [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2925.66s)]
*  And and instead of trying to fix it you come over here and tell us that we have to like do all these things [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2930.62s)]
*  You're gonna tear us [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2936.74s)]
*  You know and and this is the same this true here [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2938.74s)]
*  like that we we are buying the drugs from Mexico and [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2940.98s)]
*  Setting the weapons the cartels because we can't have rational gun laws and then we're punishing these other countries for things [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2945.3s)]
*  Demand that comes from the United States or guns that are available from the United States [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2953.86s)]
*  like [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2958.6200000000003s)]
*  We would do the world a much bigger favor if we just fixed ourselves [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2959.7000000000003s)]
*  Than anything else we could do, you know rational gun laws like addressing the crisis of belonging is driving people to fentanyl [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2963.6600000000003s)]
*  You know like legalized drugs so people can just buy some fucking gummies down the street instead of having to you know [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2970.94s)]
*  Buy them from a fucking cartel. Okay, like there are fixes to these things that are not trade wars [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2977.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, or the CIA flying drone or the CIA like doing regime change, you know [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2982.62s)]
*  One other story last one out of Latin America [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2988.58s)]
*  So bad news for anyone is hoping for a you know, broader reproach mod between the US and Venezuela [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2990.94s)]
*  So Trump is officially ending Chevron's oil license in Venezuela and giving them 30 days to end their operations there [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=2996.34s)]
*  So pretty quick just some history on this Chevron has been operating in Venezuela for more than a hundred years [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3003.74s)]
*  During Trump's first term the administration told Chevron to wind down operations as they put in sanctions in place against the Maduro government [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3009.3s)]
*  Then in 2022 the Biden administration renewed Chevron's license to operate in Venezuela and provided some sanctions relief in this deal [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3016.9s)]
*  That was designed to incentivize Venezuela to hold free and fair elections fast forward to last year's elections [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3025.06s)]
*  That didn't work. They were globally criticized for being rigged [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3032.38s)]
*  The leading opposition figure wasn't even allowed to run but the Biden team never rescinded Chevron's license [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3036.2599999999998s)]
*  I think they probably wanted that oil flowing into global supply when gas prices were high when Trump was elected [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3042.5s)]
*  And Marco Rubio became Secretary of State [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3049.46s)]
*  I think I assumed that it was only a matter of time until Trump went back to like kind of a maximum [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3051.9s)]
*  pressure maximum sanction policy on Venezuela [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3056.7799999999997s)]
*  But then surprisingly Chevron got a brief reprieve Rick Rennell flew to Venezuela [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3059.2999999999997s)]
*  To bring back six Americans who had been in prison. So the question is okay what changed? [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3065.06s)]
*  According to a really interesting story in Axios [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3070.22s)]
*  It was you don't usually hear together. No, they do pretty good [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3074.5s)]
*  It was it was parochial Florida politics [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3078.58s)]
*  The these three Cuban members of Congress basically forced Trump's hand [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3082.06s)]
*  They threatened to withhold their votes on the house budget deal unless Trump canceled the license to allow Venezuela oil exports to the US [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3086.38s)]
*  So it's just like I knew bringing this up would trigger you to the moon because it's just amazing that entire hemisphere is determined [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3094.54s)]
*  Yeah, parochial Miami three South Florida Republican members of Congress that nobody's heard of you know [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3101.18s)]
*  I mean we talk about a pack on this show and the influence of [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3107.96s)]
*  No, Israel lobby [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3112.98s)]
*  This is like the a pack of the Western Hemisphere the fact that we outsource [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3114.82s)]
*  To like literally a few neighborhoods in South Florida our entire Latin America policy crazy because these people [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3119.98s)]
*  have a [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3128.34s)]
*  Multi-decade personal vendetta against the Cuban Communist Party is absolutely fucking insane [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3129.62s)]
*  And by the way, like there's a inflation theme to today's show because I can tell you like taking Chevron [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3135.22s)]
*  Oil from Venezuela off the market on top of your trade war is not gonna dislodge Maduro [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3143.6800000000003s)]
*  It's not gonna lead to democracy in Venezuela. It's not gonna be some bank shot that hurts the Cubans [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3150.52s)]
*  But it is going to raise prices for Americans who buy gas. So [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3156.04s)]
*  Congratulations, you know like what are we doing here? [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3163.2000000000003s)]
*  So [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3167.68s)]
*  Well, they just they seem to not think that any rules apply to them in terms of like if you do X [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3169.68s)]
*  Y will happen in the economy and we're already seeing [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3176.8399999999997s)]
*  prices go up in the market go down and job losses and [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3179.7599999999998s)]
*  Then you're gonna get the impact the federal government if you were trying to crash the US economy Tommy [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3183.4s)]
*  You would literally do everything that they're doing you would start a trade war you would gut the federal government [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3188.72s)]
*  You'd like plow like money into unregulated crypto markets like they're good [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3194.52s)]
*  and actually maybe the best case scenario is is like a [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3200.48s)]
*  Economic crash that like kind of wakes this country up and and so we don't have to like get into a ward [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3203.52s)]
*  It would be woken up or something or a pandemic. But this is this is crazy [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3208.4s)]
*  No, the real problem is as well as he didn't wear a suit [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3212.64s)]
*  Well, that's the kind of thing we're pissed about. I'm upset about that final thing [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3215.7599999999998s)]

*  What's happening in Syria would be a massive story [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3617.06s)]
*  We keep getting obviously [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3619.86s)]
*  Focused on whatever Trump's doing, but we wanted to check in with you on a number of things particularly the situation with Israel [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3623.06s)]
*  But just to start [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3628.98s)]
*  You know we last had you on when this new government was just taking power or seizing power [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3631.5s)]
*  Now you know you've got a pretty established transitional government [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3639.1s)]
*  Last week there was a national dialogue conference [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3644.46s)]
*  At which they sought to demonstrate an inclusive form of governance. You've seen this kind of flurry of diplomacy with other Arab leaders [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3648.06s)]
*  This past Sunday there was an announcement. There's a committee that's gonna draft a constitutional declaration [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3656.5s)]
*  How do you assess the the current moves of the government? [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3662.02s)]
*  how how I mean it's obviously like early days, but [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3666.5s)]
*  What do you see that is making you optimistic and what are you seeing that is making you concerned? [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3671.74s)]
*  I mean much like the entire Syrian war what makes me optimistic is Syrians [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3676.74s)]
*  And what makes me pessimistic is all of the external factors that are [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3683.7s)]
*  Basically keeping down Syrians from charting their own path towards a better future. I mean to be to be really blunt and frank [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3689.4199999999996s)]
*  You say it's early days it's somewhat early days [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3697.82s)]
*  But we haven't seen any serious discussion about the sanctions that remain on Syria [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3701.34s)]
*  That were primarily for the previous regime which no longer exists [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3706.94s)]
*  Nothing on terrorism designations. These are things that really paralyze the country from external investment [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3711.54s)]
*  Qatar, you know recently said that it would increase public sector salaries [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3718.7400000000002s)]
*  For example by 400% and then finally it came out that apparently they're not because they're afraid of the Trump administration and US sanctions [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3722.54s)]
*  And at the same time you're seeing these massive aid cuts really across the board from Europe and then obviously from the United States as well [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3730.3s)]
*  And so it's you know [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3737.98s)]
*  There's a lot of challenges that the new government is facing in addition to all of these geopolitical issues [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3739.7200000000003s)]
*  Which I think at the end of the day are gonna be sort of the demise and I think [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3746.34s)]
*  And I think that those are very much [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3752.7400000000002s)]
*  Connected to the fact that you haven't seen a lot of movement or really any movement on Syria policy on the US side [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3754.7400000000002s)]
*  Because we do see Israel you sort of alluded to it [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3761.5s)]
*  Not just invading the country and occupying certain areas, but really trying to cause turmoil tension within the country [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3765.7400000000002s)]
*  And apparently lobbying the United States to allow Russia to come back to its bases [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3773.02s)]
*  And to really sort of I think keep the the country weak and divided so a lot of challenges here for the new government [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3778.6000000000004s)]
*  The National Dialogue Conference that you were talking about [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3786.04s)]
*  There was a lot of complaints that maybe we can get into but there was a lot of positives to including I think [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3789.76s)]
*  Actually those that were part of the Constitutional Committee, which are you know real serious? [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3796.4s)]
*  I think civil society heavy hitters [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3801.04s)]
*  Maybe we'll come back to that at the end [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3803.56s)]
*  but I do think we have to focus on the geopolitics because that like you said everything in Syria has been shaped by [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3805.24s)]
*  external actors and [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3812.08s)]
*  I guess could you just explain to people who may not be following this that closely? [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3814.2s)]
*  just the extent of what Israel is doing in southern Syria as well as [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3820.08s)]
*  You know in addition to kind of military operations [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3825.72s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu started to describe [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3829.4399999999996s)]
*  You know essentially kind of a weak [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3832.08s)]
*  Demilitarized Syria that it you know Israel can push around and will [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3835.04s)]
*  What is happening in southern Syria and and why would you tell people that's that's important? [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3840.4s)]
*  Well, I'm actually gonna go back to maybe even November. So before the fall of us said you saw a lot of discussions [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3845.48s)]
*  from Israel from the supporters of Israel talking about [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3853.92s)]
*  Really trying to build links with the Druze community in the south of Syria with the Kurds in the north [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3858.2400000000002s)]
*  And a lot of this had to do with Israel trying to create a security corridor in the south [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3864.32s)]
*  But in the north it had a lot to do with the weakening ties between Turkey and Israel over the Gaza situation [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3869.52s)]
*  So in May you saw Erdogan president Erdogan [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3877.7200000000003s)]
*  Suspend this eight billion dollar trade agreement [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3881.92s)]
*  There's been you know a lot of more pro-palestinian rhetoric in Turkey and and Israel was essentially trying to use its [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3884.68s)]
*  pre-existing ties with the Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria to try to sort of build that kind of divide [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3892.7999999999997s)]
*  Create a security corridor that security corridor also worked for [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3902.16s)]
*  Pushing against obviously Iranian influence in the country as well [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3907.08s)]
*  Then you have the fall of Assad [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3912.16s)]
*  and [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3914.8399999999997s)]
*  immediately within 48 hours Israel launches 500 attacks on [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3915.56s)]
*  On Syria by some estimates eliminating, you know 70 to 80 percent of Syria's military, you know sort of strategic capabilities [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3921.2s)]
*  This is an enormous challenge for a new country as well [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3930.0s)]
*  That's trying to create security within the country that is, you know, essentially ruled by still a foreign designated terrorist organization [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3933.3199999999997s)]
*  So who's gonna replace a lot of that security capabilities for a country like Syria? Probably no one [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3941.68s)]
*  Except for maybe Russia and so you immediately had Russia come in and really try to [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3949.8399999999997s)]
*  Reestablish ties with the new government, which is pretty astounding given [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3955.8799999999997s)]
*  Russia's very close alliance with you know, the Assad regime throughout all of this essentially essentially bombarding most of Syria for the past 10 years [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3960.56s)]
*  You know and this was because of the challenges that the new government faces and then fast forward to you know [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3969.48s)]
*  The past few weeks and you continue to see more attacks [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3975.96s)]
*  So what you saw to attack just yesterday on what appears to be some kind of new government slash Turkey Naval Patrol [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3981.04s)]
*  But you also have and this is I think the the thing that you're alluding to is essentially the invasion of Syria [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3989.76s)]
*  Past the Golan Heights past the demilitarized zone that was established in 1974 [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=3997.2799999999997s)]
*  And retaking essentially Mount Hermon, which is a very strategic point [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4004.72s)]
*  It's the highest point in the eastern Mediterranean area about 9200 meters [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4009.8399999999997s)]
*  And and actually taking the upstream waters from the Wahda Dam [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4016.64s)]
*  Which is something that Syria shares with Jordan [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4021.2799999999997s)]
*  So also affecting Jordan's water security downstream, which I don't see any reporting on that for some reason [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4024.08s)]
*  And then gradually moving further and further in and so you have [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4030.3199999999997s)]
*  You know some some raids going on still in the south [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4034.96s)]
*  Netanyahu has come out and so have other members of his cabinet saying that the southern areas of Syria need to be completely demilitarized [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4038.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean, these are three governors of a [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4046.7999999999997s)]
*  of a country [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4049.44s)]
*  And so it's you know that the the actions alone [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4050.72s)]
*  Were pretty astounding [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4055.8399999999997s)]
*  And then in very recent days you had Israeli cabinet officials essentially [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4058.08s)]
*  You know reaching out to the druze community saying you can work in the occupied Golan Heights [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4064.3199999999997s)]
*  For 75 100 a day, which is you know, three months of salary in in Syria right now [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4070.08s)]
*  Which is you know three months of salary and in Syria right now [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4076.72s)]
*  And you also have them sort of stirring up [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4082.3999999999996s)]
*  unrest suggesting that you know, the druze community is under threat and that israel will come to support and protect the druze [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4085.6s)]
*  If if the new government harms them [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4095.04s)]
*  This is a situation where israel is essentially creating a problem that doesn't exist though. Yeah [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4097.84s)]
*  Um, it doesn't seem like the druze are under threat at all [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4103.36s)]
*  um, and so it's um [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4107.92s)]
*  It sort of remains to be seen, you know, what's going to happen from all of this? [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4110.88s)]
*  But certainly in the initial phases it has failed and actually united the druze community [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4114.4s)]
*  I think with the larger syrian community in a lot of these protests against sort of israeli [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4121.2s)]
*  Occupation so I mean you're describing, you know essentially the invasion of a sovereign country [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4127.34s)]
*  And the seizing of its resources [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4133.92s)]
*  This may confuse some people right because they think well, I thought asad was part of the axis of resistance and [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4137.12s)]
*  obviously, you know, you can see why there may be trepidation about uh, akhmed al shara the new leader of syria and [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4142.88s)]
*  He's an islamist. But in reality, I don't think there's anybody [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4151.679999999999s)]
*  That believes that this new syrian government's like preparing for war with israel or something [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4156.08s)]
*  Um, what is what do you assess to be? [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4161.44s)]
*  Israel's objective. I mean you mentioned [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4166.16s)]
*  It may be that they they're wary of an islamist government. It may be that they're in a geopolitical competition with erdogan [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4168.88s)]
*  but it also seems like [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4176.0s)]
*  Is this a land grab like they're they're just trying to kind of [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4178.16s)]
*  Acquire more resources and use this kind of druze thing as an excuse for it [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4181.84s)]
*  um, I can also see why kind of [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4185.76s)]
*  You know casting syria back into like a weak failed state might not be good for israel security [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4188.8s)]
*  But what what is your best guess at? [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4195.5199999999995s)]
*  what the israeli interests are that they're acting on and what are the [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4198.5599999999995s)]
*  Tools available to the syrian government to to deal with this [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4202.719999999999s)]
*  Mainly i've seen them kind of try to reach out to arab states and get unity [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4206.24s)]
*  But it's not like that has kind of affected israel's behavior that much in other contexts [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4209.679999999999s)]
*  But but how do you see the israeli intention here? [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4214.32s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think I think it's a bit of all of the above [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4217.759999999999s)]
*  Um from from the the issues that you listed and this is not [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4220.8s)]
*  Really a new strategy either i've been recently reading a syrian author called el marut who? [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4224.8s)]
*  You know basically jokes how much buffer does [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4230.719999999999s)]
*  Israel need to feel safe and he says do they need syria do they need lebanon do they need bosnia [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4234.48s)]
*  Do they need northern europe and so on and so forth. This was a book that was published in 1987 [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4239.36s)]
*  So this is not this this isn't sort of a new sort of doctrine, I think [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4244.099999999999s)]
*  In addition to that you do have this, you know [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4250.26s)]
*  periphery doctrine that people are discussing more now from [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4253.3s)]
*  You know ben gurion day's 1950s [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4257.94s)]
*  where essentially israel tries to [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4260.66s)]
*  Uh create alliances with either non-arab or non-muslim communities around the arab world [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4264.099999999999s)]
*  To sort of you know have have uh stalwart alliances with um with those that might feel under threat [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4270.66s)]
*  So in many cases this has not worked [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4276.9s)]
*  But it certainly has worked to a certain extent with you know, the maronites in lebanon the kurds and um [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4279.139999999999s)]
*  Now especially in syria, but also, uh, I would say unofficially with the krg in iraq [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4285.379999999999s)]
*  And so and now they're you know, they're trying to do it with with the druze community in the south [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4292.099999999999s)]
*  So this is not really a new strategy per se [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4296.9s)]
*  Um, it you know, I think israel feels very much emboldened by the past year and a half [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4300.74s)]
*  if not more [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4306.339999999999s)]
*  And especially so with the trump administration who seems to be [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4307.86s)]
*  You know really giving israel carte blanche even more than the biden administration, which is saying a lot [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4311.78s)]
*  um [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4317.46s)]
*  And so, you know, they're taking what they can get while they get it. Um, and I mean I agree with you that it [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4318.58s)]
*  Seems a little bit counterintuitive. Why would you want an unstable divided country? [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4325.86s)]
*  on your flank [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4331.06s)]
*  Especially ruled by at least what you perceive to be and would have been calling a sort of a terrorist [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4332.9800000000005s)]
*  organization [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4338.88s)]
*  Um, we can argue about that [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4340.1s)]
*  um, but you know, I think asherah who's like the new sort of [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4342.5s)]
*  Interim president let's say of of of syria is is well aware of these challenges and I think [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4347.36s)]
*  He probably hoped that he could um, you know reassure [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4353.9400000000005s)]
*  Israel and you know in statements, he's explicitly said he's not seeking a war with israel [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4359.780000000001s)]
*  He's not seeking any kind of violence along that border. They're hoping to secure the border [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4365.14s)]
*  um [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4369.9400000000005s)]
*  And consolidate power monopolize violence like that those kinds of things to reassure israel that you know, they would be safe [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4371.14s)]
*  um that clearly [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4379.22s)]
*  You know has not reassured israel though, and so we see all of these, you know, essentially land grabs [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4381.46s)]
*  Yeah moving around the map here. Uh, there's also the issue of uh, the kurds [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4387.62s)]
*  And northern and eastern syria [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4393.54s)]
*  In turkey [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4397.38s)]
*  The pkk which has been you know involved in a civil conflict with the turkish government for decades [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4398.740000000001s)]
*  declared a ceasefire [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4405.7s)]
*  There's still this kind of question the kurds seen the most reluctant to kind of come underneath the umbrella of the transitional government in syria [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4407.7s)]
*  what is the impact of the [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4414.5s)]
*  turkish dynamic with kurds inside of turkey [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4416.74s)]
*  And and where do things currently stand? Uh with the syrian kurds? [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4420.26s)]
*  Yeah, so this is a very interesting but also complex dynamic that goes back decades [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4425.54s)]
*  unfortunately, but um, so essentially what you had first is uh, the pkk [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4432.0199999999995s)]
*  Which has been essentially at war with turkey since the 1980s [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4437.86s)]
*  um the the leader [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4442.099999999999s)]
*  of that group that has been under house arrest since [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4444.74s)]
*  I think the the late 90s 98 [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4451.139999999999s)]
*  um [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4454.179999999999s)]
*  Basically calling for the pkk to lay down their arms, which is a pretty big deal [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4455.139999999999s)]
*  um the last time we saw any kind of rapprochement or attempt at that was 2015 [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4460.98s)]
*  Between turkey and the pkk [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4467.24s)]
*  Uh and that fell apart [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4469.32s)]
*  This time you actually see [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4471.88s)]
*  Um, I mean the pkk is a bit divided between more extreme elements and more moderate elements [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4474.2s)]
*  So the more moderate elements are going along with this the more extreme elements are, you know voicing their concerns [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4478.68s)]
*  Um, but erdogan has his domestic reasons [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4485.4800000000005s)]
*  Um for pushing this forward as well. You actually even see the nationalist [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4488.76s)]
*  Mhp and in in turkey this party. It's quite anti-kurdish pushing these negotiations [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4494.76s)]
*  This agreement forward as well, which is quite surprising [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4501.0s)]
*  um, and a lot of this [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4504.599999999999s)]
*  Uh likely stems from the fact that erdogan can't legally at this point run for president in 2028 [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4506.68s)]
*  And so he needs to garner more support from all of the other major parties in turkey [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4513.5599999999995s)]
*  in order to [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4518.76s)]
*  Make the legal case that he can indeed do that. So there's there's sort of those domestic reasons at play [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4520.44s)]
*  um, then you you know, you also have the obviously the situation in syria where [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4527.5599999999995s)]
*  I think in the immediate aftermath of the fall of us said everyone was saying oh turkey's the big winner here because [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4533.4s)]
*  um, you know, these are groups the groups that essentially took over are like hts is a group that is [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4539.799999999999s)]
*  um more strongly affiliated with with turkey [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4546.679999999999s)]
*  Uh than any other sort of country out there [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4550.679999999999s)]
*  Um, but you also had the fear of the kurds [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4553.879999999999s)]
*  sort of the not all kurds, but the syrian democratic forces that the united states has [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4558.28s)]
*  Supported all these years in the counter-isis fight in northeastern syria [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4563.24s)]
*  Really concerned about its position [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4567.799999999999s)]
*  um, but what's really interesting is that actually general masloum of the sdf [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4571.08s)]
*  Was one of the few kurdish elements that basically said this deal has nothing to do with us [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4577.660000000001s)]
*  So whatever the pkk in turkey arranges that has nothing to do with what we want and I think to a certain extent [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4583.58s)]
*  Uh, you know, they're they're still holding their cards close to their chest. They don't have a lot of cards at this point [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4591.1s)]
*  Um, but they're really trying to hold on to them [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4597.26s)]
*  um, and I do think that they are [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4600.22s)]
*  You know really thinking about this alliance with israel as well [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4603.660000000001s)]
*  Because it does seem [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4607.9800000000005s)]
*  Uh, and we could talk about how us had did this too. Yeah, I said one and I said two [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4609.660000000001s)]
*  That you know reassuring israel [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4614.860000000001s)]
*  And being allied to israel even unofficially [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4617.900000000001s)]
*  Does help with your survival in the middle east. Yeah [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4621.740000000001s)]
*  Well, it's it does feel like it's interesting that israel is playing its cards [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4626.38s)]
*  Um [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4632.14s)]
*  In response to turkey and then that brings us all the way back to russia [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4633.58s)]
*  um [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4637.66s)]
*  You know russia has made contact with this government [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4638.7s)]
*  As you said like russia is potentially even though they literally bomb these people hts [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4642.7s)]
*  You know, prudence is nothing if not pragmatic [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4649.66s)]
*  and in a [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4652.3s)]
*  super bizarre way, um [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4653.42s)]
*  Maybe one way to get out from under us sanctions is to get close to putin [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4655.98s)]
*  Um, I never thought i'd say that but I mean that you know given this administration's affinity for putin maybe [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4660.860000000001s)]
*  If israel and russia are okay with this government. I mean what what how do you what do you how do you make sense of the [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4666.860000000001s)]
*  Russian dynamic and all this [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4673.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's just wild [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4675.02s)]
*  So immediately after the fall of us said you actually saw high level diplomatic contact between [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4678.22s)]
*  um, you know the new president of syria ostensibly uh shara [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4684.7s)]
*  And bakdanov and other very high level russian officials [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4689.5s)]
*  Um, you immediately had russia sort of changing its tone [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4693.099999999999s)]
*  On hts. I mean for a long time it was calling anyone who opposed the regime terrorists and then suddenly [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4697.179999999999s)]
*  All of that changed and that's of course, uh, um, because listeners will probably know [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4703.66s)]
*  Um, you know syria was essentially russia's first launching point outside of its near abroad [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4708.38s)]
*  Um really for you know, I think [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4715.740000000001s)]
*  greater global influence [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4718.54s)]
*  Um, and that certainly worked um in in the middle east and it worked as a launching point into into africa as well [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4720.62s)]
*  in the mediterranean so uh, so russia has this [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4728.3s)]
*  This mediterranean port in tartus this uh sort of naval base [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4731.900000000001s)]
*  And also an air base [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4737.1s)]
*  Along the western coast. Um, and really wanted to hold on to that [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4739.5s)]
*  Um, I think you know with the the fall of us said [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4744.38s)]
*  um [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4748.94s)]
*  You know I said was sort of viewed as a kind of a toxic asset at that point by both russia and iran [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4749.82s)]
*  Which is probably why you saw [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4756.139999999999s)]
*  The regime crumble so quickly [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4758.54s)]
*  um because both of these uh, and we can talk about why on the iran side but [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4761.099999999999s)]
*  um, but for russia clearly they wanted to focus on ukraine [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4765.98s)]
*  and thought [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4770.62s)]
*  perhaps [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4772.0599999999995s)]
*  They could make some kind of deal with this new administration if i said did fall and we do know that there were some talks [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4773.26s)]
*  Prior to us at really falling in in early december [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4780.46s)]
*  um, so [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4783.9800000000005s)]
*  You know now you have israel. I mean, this is just really all of this is quite insane [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4785.66s)]
*  So you have israel essentially lobbying the united states to allow [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4790.3s)]
*  The new syrian government the new syrian government to let russia back to its basis hasn't completely left [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4794.38s)]
*  It also hasn't by the way completely left northeastern syria. It still has that presence there [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4800.94s)]
*  um, but you know essentially I think for for israel [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4805.98s)]
*  They they trust russia to kind of stabilize things [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4810.38s)]
*  um [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4814.0599999999995s)]
*  and uh, I think in a previous administration one of the differences you might have seen [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4815.34s)]
*  Is with a biden administration or harris administration you might have seen this as a [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4821.26s)]
*  You know a great opportunity to get russia out of the u.s's traditional sphere of influence [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4826.06s)]
*  um, but with this administration [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4833.1s)]
*  Which we saw on friday [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4835.82s)]
*  seems to be [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4838.14s)]
*  Quite closely aligned with russia and putin [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4839.66s)]
*  Um, that's clearly not a motivating factor. So, um, we could indeed see russia [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4842.38s)]
*  I think returning [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4848.22s)]
*  Uh, that's a dizzying tour [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4850.06s)]
*  uh [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4852.3s)]
*  I mean just quickly to finish. I I assume that if you're [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4854.06s)]
*  al-shar'a, if you're the interim government [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4857.660000000001s)]
*  You just got to try to maintain as much unity in the country as possible while this is happening around you, right? [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4860.54s)]
*  I mean, that's that's essentially the only play that I can make up. That is the goal and I think [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4866.06s)]
*  You know really trying to get the arab countries and anyone that has any kind of influence on the u.s [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4872.46s)]
*  To at the very least, you know remove these sanctions alleviate the sanctions do something about the designation [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4878.700000000001s)]
*  because with no aid [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4885.740000000001s)]
*  And with these sanctions remaining in place [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4888.06s)]
*  I just don't see [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4890.700000000001s)]
*  how [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4892.860000000001s)]
*  Syria holds together and frankly [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4893.820000000001s)]
*  You know that should be of a grave concern to the united states. Yeah, because a country like that a sanctioned country [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4896.46s)]
*  Um does not bode well economically or politically for the united states [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4903.580000000001s)]
*  I mean, this is going to be a country that you know needs to resort to nefarious actors to just stay afloat. Yeah, so [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4908.06s)]
*  You know a big strategic [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4916.860000000001s)]
*  Opportunity lost. Yeah. Yeah. No, I agree. Well look natasha. Thanks so much for [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4920.120000000001s)]
*  You know walking us through all that people should follow your work [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4926.06s)]
*  Uh at csis and online [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4929.740000000001s)]
*  Uh, and uh, well, i'm sure have occasion to talk to you again, but thanks so much for joining us [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4933.26s)]
*  Thanks for having me. Thanks again and natasha for joining the show talk to you guys next week [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb5_bHQ4NTQ&t=4937.34s)]
