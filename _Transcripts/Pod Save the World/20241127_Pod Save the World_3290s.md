# Ceasefire Reached to End Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon
**Pod Save the World:** [November 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY)
*  Welcome back to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitori. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Ben Rhodes. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1.92s)]
*  Ben, happy preemptive Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving week to you. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  Yes, I'm in New York for Thanksgiving. We switch off Thanksgiving and Christmas. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=7.12s)]
*  It's a nice time of year here. So happy Thanksgiving to you. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=12.8s)]
*  You're gonna do the Macy's Day Parade. I did that with my dad a couple times. It was very fun. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  I don't think so this year. I've done it two or three times with my kids. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=19.2s)]
*  It's like a pretty big ordeal with kids, you know, like standing in line. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=23.6s)]
*  I think one time actually we had a COVID case from the from the close crowds there. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=27.68s)]
*  So we'll be watching on TV like everybody else, I think. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=35.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's probably better. Watch a little turkey pardon footage, you know, kind of delay our [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=37.36s)]
*  acceptance that the Trump administration will be returning. But yeah, all good stuff. Hey, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  at least we eat a lot of food. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=47.84s)]
*  Where do you stand on the turkey pardon gate? I don't know if people are following this [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=48.96s)]
*  highly online question of whether Joe Biden should do away with the turkey pardon. I don't [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  quite understand the logic if it's if it's vindictive towards turkeys or what is it? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=56.4s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=62.08s)]
*  What the fuck are they talking about? It's a fun, light, silly event for puns. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, seriously. It was one time a year. Remember, you'd see Sasha and Malia too. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=66.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=70.16s)]
*  So it was always fun. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=71.2s)]
*  Rolling their eyes at their dad. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=72.16s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=73.44s)]
*  We got a great show for everybody this week. We're going to talk about some [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=74.4s)]
*  late breaking news of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=77.68s)]
*  This is some rare good news there. We're also going to cover some of the new names added to [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=82.24s)]
*  Trump's national security team and the reaction to his threat to slap new tariffs on Mexico, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=86.16s)]
*  Canada and China. The more things change, the more they stay the same. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  Ben, we're also going to cover the International Criminal Court's arrest warrant against Israeli [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=95.2s)]
*  Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu and another aid. The Israeli government's crackdown on a progressive [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=98.88s)]
*  newspaper called Haaretz and what that tells us about the health of its democracy. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=104.16s)]
*  And then we're going to talk about Russia's experimental missile attack on Ukraine, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  the depressing result of the COP29 climate summit, the arrest of dozens of pro-democracy [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=112.32s)]
*  advocates in Hong Kong, how Brazil treats former presidents who try to stage coups. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=117.27999999999999s)]
*  And then, Ben, you got a big interview coming this week. What do we got? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I sat down with Malala and Saramani, who's a filmmaker. And Malala executive produced a film [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=126.0s)]
*  about several Afghan women and it traces their lives from the collapse in Kabul, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=135.51999999999998s)]
*  kind of up till fairly recently. And these are all women that resisted the Taliban. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=141.36s)]
*  Some of them were protesting or all of them were protesting in their own ways. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=145.60000000000002s)]
*  It's a remarkable peek behind the curtain of what life is like in Kabul, what women are doing to [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=149.28s)]
*  resist the way that life has changed. So it's an extraordinary film called Bread and Roses, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=154.8s)]
*  that's out on Apple now. But it's also an extraordinary interview. Malala has some [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=160.96s)]
*  serious wisdom that she drops, both about the film, but also just about how to be resilient. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=165.76000000000002s)]
*  At difficult times and we're in those times, it's not as difficult as the Afghan women are [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=171.60000000000002s)]
*  going through, or the Malala's gone through, but everybody should definitely check it out. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Probably some real good perspective there. I am excited to see this movie. And you and I were [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=179.28s)]
*  talking about it last week and you just made the point that's like, just to see kind of people [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=182.96s)]
*  living their life normally, street scenes in Kabul. When you sat in government meetings about [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=187.52s)]
*  Afghanistan, you never saw that perspective. It was all like security this and training of Afghan [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=192.08s)]
*  security forces and poppy eradication. And this is just like human beings living their lives in [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=197.44s)]
*  this city now. That's exactly right. I mean, there's so many reasons to watch this film, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=201.92s)]
*  but that's absolutely one of them. We talk about these places and we so rarely see them. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=206.64s)]
*  And I had the same, I thought exactly what you said, right? Like how many memos did we read about [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=210.48s)]
*  Afghanistan? How many reports with data? And what you didn't get from that is the people. And so [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=214.96s)]
*  I hope everybody watch, I hope people in government watch this, although I'm not that [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=223.28s)]
*  optimistic about the Trump administration's prioritization of women in Afghanistan, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=226.24s)]
*  but we'll see. I mean, not that Joe Biden was good on that either, but everybody should definitely [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=230.24s)]
*  watch it. No, Trump's just going to fly a C-17 over to get back some equipment. It seems like [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=234.24s)]
*  that's the only thing he really cares about in Afghanistan. But you mentioned Joe Biden. So [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=238.8s)]
*  let's start with this late breaking news that a ceasefire deal has been reached between Israel [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=242.4s)]
*  and Lebanon. President Biden just went out and spoke about it, which we'll get to in a second. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=248.08s)]
*  Here's what we know about the terms of the deal. So the Israeli military will have 60 days [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=251.60000000000002s)]
*  to withdraw from Southern Lebanon. Hezbollah will move its operations and weapons north of [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=256.0s)]
*  the Latani river. Then the Lebanese military is going to deploy along the border to try and enforce [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=261.12s)]
*  the agreement and keep Hezbollah away from the Israeli border and prevent them from firing [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=267.92s)]
*  into Northern Israel. The U.S. will take the lead to oversee the implementation of this agreement. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=272.72s)]
*  There'll be a group of countries. I think Biden gave France a shout out as part of this coalition, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=277.76s)]
*  but the U.S. will take the lead. The U.S. has agreed to support Israeli action if Hezbollah [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=282.0s)]
*  comes near the border again or threatens Israeli interests, but only if the IDF consults the U.S. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=287.44s)]
*  first. So there can't be unilateral action by the F is part of the deal. That latter point about [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=292.88s)]
*  the implementation and the Israelis demanding some freedom of action if Hezbollah does something to [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=298.4s)]
*  violate the agreement, I think is a recognition of the fact that the ceasefire after the 2006 war [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=303.52s)]
*  between Israel and Lebanon didn't really hold. There's been regular bombardment and airstrikes. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=309.04s)]
*  Big picture. This is obviously a huge relief to everyone in Lebanon and to a lot of Israelis. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=315.6s)]
*  The Lebanese Health Ministry says that over 3,800 people have been killed by Israeli airstrikes [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=320.96000000000004s)]
*  since October 2023. Over a million people in Lebanon have been displaced by this fighting, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  as were an estimated 60,000 residents of Northern Israel. Here's a clip of Biden [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=331.12s)]
*  speaking about the deal on Tuesday afternoon. If Hezbollah or anyone else breaks the deal [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=336.32s)]
*  and poses a direct threat to Israel, then Israel retains the right to self-defense [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=341.84s)]
*  consistent with international law, just like any country when facing a terrorist group pledge [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=347.04s)]
*  to that country's destruction. At the same time, this deal supports Lebanon's sovereignty. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=353.36s)]
*  And so it heralds a new start for Lebanon, a country that I've seen most of over the years, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=361.52s)]
*  a country with rich history and culture. If fully implemented, this deal can put Lebanon on a path [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=366.8s)]
*  toward a future that's worthy of a significant past. So obviously a lot of people are also [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=373.36s)]
*  desperate to see a ceasefire in Gaza and have been for many, many months. It seems like maybe [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=378.56s)]
*  a key difference that helped get this deal done in Lebanon is the fact that the right-wing nationalists [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=383.28s)]
*  in Netanyahu's coalition, people like Itamar Ben-Gavir, said they opposed a ceasefire deal [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=388.4s)]
*  with Hezbollah, but they didn't threaten to topple the government for it. So I think that allowed [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=393.44s)]
*  it to go through. But what was your reaction to this thing finally getting done? Well, look, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=397.2s)]
*  I mean, it's obviously, as you said, it's a positive step for people in Lebanon who've been [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=400.96s)]
*  under bombardment, perhaps for people in Northern Israel if they choose to return to their homes. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=405.44s)]
*  And look, the administration's got three open accounts in that region. They've got the war [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=413.2s)]
*  in Gaza. They've got the back and forth between Israel and Iran. And then they've got the war in [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=417.76s)]
*  Lebanon. And this is the one that was always most likely to be concluded. First, there's a question [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=422.24s)]
*  of whether it will hold. And that's an open question. Will the Lebanese armed forces [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=429.76s)]
*  really take on Hezbollah if they see them? And do they have the capacity in any event to [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=435.28s)]
*  supplant them? I mean, that's a big open question, right? That's right. Because some of this is just [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=440.24s)]
*  people from Southern Lebanon are in Hezbollah, right? Will the Israelis show restraint? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=444.32s)]
*  These are all open questions. And importantly, the 60-day deadline takes you into the Trump [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=450.0s)]
*  administration. So the US mediator is going to be the Trump people. Not as if Biden's been [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=454.0s)]
*  particularly tough on Israel, but you have to assume that there's going to be an even friendlier [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=462.24s)]
*  ear. And that may have factored into Netanyahu's timing. And let's face it. Let's look at when the [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=466.96s)]
*  escalation peaked in Lebanon. I'm not to be cynical here, but it peaked in September and [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=472.24s)]
*  October right before the election. And obviously, it created political problems for Kamala Harris. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=477.84000000000003s)]
*  And this is clearing an account at the end of the Biden administration, but also heading into the [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=483.76s)]
*  Trump administration. And I have to think that that probably factored into Netanyahu's timing [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=487.76s)]
*  as well. At the end of the day, the main event is Gaza. And it always has been since October 7th, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=493.28000000000003s)]
*  obviously. And Netanyahu's remarks, he talked about how this is going to make it easier for [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=499.76s)]
*  them to go after Hamas. So there was no indication of a ceasefire for hostages deal, no indication [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=504.88s)]
*  that there's any rethinking of essentially this kind of open-ended conflict state and bombardment [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=511.59999999999997s)]
*  of Gaza. And so that kind of remains to me the war that the Lebanon war was kind of an offshoot of. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=517.4399999999999s)]
*  So the positive step, it's a little ghoulish to see kind of an administration victory lap on this [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=527.12s)]
*  thing when they wanted to prevent this from happening in the first place, the war in Lebanon. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=533.52s)]
*  And ultimately, it's Gaza that is the thing that obviously has caused the most loss of life and [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=539.36s)]
*  the most instability in the region. But a positive step that people worked very hard to reach. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=546.24s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, Lebanon is definitely an offshoot of the war in Gaza, albeit against, I think, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=551.12s)]
*  a better armed and more sort of fearsome actor in Hezbollah. I should have said that [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=555.44s)]
*  one of the reasons this deal, another reason this deal got done is because Hassan Nasrallah, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=559.36s)]
*  the former head of Hezbollah who was assassinated by the Israelis, used to make a ceasefire in Gaza, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=562.8800000000001s)]
*  a precondition to a ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel. And that condition changed after his [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=570.5600000000001s)]
*  death. So you're right that there's still this huge challenge in Gaza, this horrible humanitarian [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=576.1600000000001s)]
*  nightmare that's just getting worse every single day. But good to see people in Beirut [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=582.8s)]
*  not getting bombarded anymore. Absolutely. One other thing we should say is that the Israelis [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=587.28s)]
*  were taking some tough losses in their ground invasion into Lebanon. There was some tough [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=591.4399999999999s)]
*  fighting. Hezbollah was still firing back. And Netanyahu in his statement about this talked [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=598.24s)]
*  pretty, I thought candidly about this is a time for them to kind of regroup, rearm. And so I think [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=602.64s)]
*  they wanted to ease the pressure on the IDF. At the same time, that's what's in Hezbollah, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=609.04s)]
*  is that they get to regroup. They obviously need to figure out what they are after all the losses [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=614.0799999999999s)]
*  they've had. So everybody kind of takes a breath here. Let's hope that it holds though. It's no [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=619.76s)]
*  guarantee, by the way, that this holds. One incident could kind of ratchet things up again. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=626.16s)]
*  But I think first and foremost, yeah, for those million people can return home. That's a huge, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=630.8s)]
*  positive step. Yeah, for the Israelis in northern Israel who basically have been at home for a year, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=637.04s)]
*  60,000 people. We're going to talk about a couple more Israel specific stories in a minute. But [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=641.8399999999999s)]
*  first we're going to do a quick update on the latest national security cabinet or staffing news [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=645.76s)]
*  from the Trump team. So after a teenager and Venmo enthusiast Matt Gaetz withdrew from [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=649.5999999999999s)]
*  consideration to be attorney general, Trump made this flurry of personnel appointments to kind of [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=655.52s)]
*  change the narrative as like a Friday news dump. That included two key national security roles. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=660.0s)]
*  The first of the two is a guy named Alex Wong, who's going to be Trump's deputy national security [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=665.36s)]
*  advisor. Wong served in the first Trump administration. He was a special representative [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=670.0s)]
*  for North Korea. He apparently helped broker the bromance and symmetry with Kim Jong-un. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=674.08s)]
*  He also served as deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs at the [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=679.12s)]
*  State Department. Seems like a pretty normie national security pick for Trump, albeit another [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=683.92s)]
*  China hawk. He'll report up to Mike Waltz, the incoming national security advisor. Neither of [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=688.96s)]
*  those guys has to be confirmed by the Senate, so they got the job. It's over. But the pattern, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=694.16s)]
*  Ben, has been for every kind of normie selection, like a Marco Rubio, you get a total freak show, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=699.36s)]
*  like a Tulsi Gabbard. This is no different. So that gets us to a guy named Seb Gorka. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=704.7199999999999s)]
*  Seb Gorka will now be the deputy assistant to the president and senior director for counterterrorism. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=710.3199999999999s)]
*  You might remember Gorka from Trump 1.0. He is this comically bombastic British Hungarian American [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=715.36s)]
*  radio host. His credentials are dubious at best. I think his own PhD advisor said he wouldn't [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=723.28s)]
*  consider Gorka to be an expert on terrorism. Someone connected to the Trump transition team [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=729.04s)]
*  said on background to the Washington Post, quote, almost universally, the entire team considers [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=735.1999999999999s)]
*  Gorka a clown. Great quote there. Gorka's views on Islam are just way out there. He's like one of [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=740.16s)]
*  those guys who thinks that the United States is just days away from living under Sharia law. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=746.88s)]
*  Back in 2017, he was at the White House for like a cup of coffee at a couple months, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=752.4s)]
*  but then he got pushed out along with Steve Bannon. Here's a clip of Trump's former national [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=757.4399999999999s)]
*  security advisor, John Bolton, talking about Gorka on CNN. Well, Sebastian Gorka is a con man. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=762.0799999999999s)]
*  I wouldn't have him in any US government. Fortunately, it's not the highest position [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=768.88s)]
*  he had been mentioned for. But I don't think it's going to abode well for counterterrorism efforts [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=775.84s)]
*  when the NSC senior director is somebody like that. I think he is a perfect example of somebody who [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=782.16s)]
*  owes his position purely to Donald Trump. He doesn't display loyalty. He displays fealty. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=790.64s)]
*  And that's what Trump wants. He doesn't want Gorka's opinions. He wants Gorka to say, yes, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=797.1999999999999s)]
*  sir. And I am fully confident that's exactly what will happen no matter what it is Trump says. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=802.0799999999999s)]
*  So man, Gorka is an asshole. He's a clown. He's no business being in this job. But I think my [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=807.36s)]
*  honestly my reaction was relief that he's not the deputy national security advisor. But what was [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=812.72s)]
*  your take? Yeah, well, you're right. Normie for crazy. And look, Gorka was probably floating [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=815.92s)]
*  himself for that deputy national security advisor role. And I'm sure Waltz is like that no way that [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=821.2s)]
*  guy's gonna be my fucking deputy. But if you think about it, and Bolton, who we don't agree [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=825.6s)]
*  about anything points this out, if he actually is the senior director for counterterrorism, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=831.9200000000001s)]
*  that's not an insignificant position. Right? I mean, post 9 11, this was seen as one of the [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=836.96s)]
*  most important positions government. And so people understand what that means is, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=841.76s)]
*  you're both the principal White House advisor to the president on counterterrorism issues. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=845.2s)]
*  You also coordinate all the parts of the government that are involved in counterterrorism, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=851.92s)]
*  which is a lot, right? Because it's the FBI, it's the CIA, it's the DOD, it's the State Department, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=855.76s)]
*  there's military operations involved, you know, so were he to actually do this job? And that's an [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=860.24s)]
*  open question. Maybe he's just there to wander in and out of meetings, which is what he did last [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=864.96s)]
*  time. But if actually this guy's taking the reins, it's quite concerning. You know, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=869.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, like he'll probably be able to order people killed. Like that's what we're talking about, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=873.9200000000001s)]
*  like drone strikes. Yeah. And that doesn't make me sleep better. I do think I'm kind of curious [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=877.36s)]
*  what the expiration date is on sub Gorka, because he has a unique capacity to piss off even his [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=882.72s)]
*  MAGA colleagues. So he may go in for the victory lap. And so he can put this once more on his, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=887.9200000000001s)]
*  you know, social media biography, we'll see. But it does feel like there's a pattern of him [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=894.24s)]
*  kind of burrowing these extreme nutcases into some of these staff positions. And I think what's [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=899.84s)]
*  worth watching is, again, whether he sticks around and takes actual authority. That's what [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=906.72s)]
*  would be concerning versus whether he's just like an ornament. Yeah, the other name we've been [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=910.88s)]
*  watching and kind of like the extremist unqualified staffing group is this guy, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=914.5600000000001s)]
*  Cash Patel, that we've talked about a bunch of times, he's the one who wrote the kids book [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=920.16s)]
*  about King Trump. Apparently, Axios reported that Trump doesn't think Patel will get confirmed as [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=923.36s)]
*  FBI director by the Senate or thinks he might struggle. So he's considering making him the [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=930.88s)]
*  deputy director or some other top role at DOJ to investigate, I don't know, the 2020 election or [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=934.5600000000001s)]
*  whatever Trump's mad about. Again, remember that Christopher Wray was appointed by Trump to the job [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=941.36s)]
*  of FBI director in 2017. It's supposed to be a 10 year term, but Trump wants to toss him. And it [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=946.48s)]
*  sounds like the kind of hardcore MAGA influencers have killed the prospect of Mike Rogers, this kind [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=951.2s)]
*  of normie Republican congressman from Michigan of getting FBI director. And then one other bit of [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=957.5200000000001s)]
*  staffing news that I thought you'd enjoy, Ben, is there's a Trump legal advisor named Boris [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=962.5600000000001s)]
*  Epstein. He is reportedly being investigated for shaking down would be Trump administration [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=967.12s)]
*  members who want jobs, including asking for $100,000 per month from someone to promote them [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=973.12s)]
*  for a position. Just like incredible stuff happening over the transition team this year. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=981.2s)]
*  I think that the main pattern to watch of the entire Trump administration, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=985.2800000000001s)]
*  including on foreign policy, is just corruption and the monetization of everything. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=989.0400000000001s)]
*  Some griffs will be completely hackish like this one, like shaking people down for cash. Some will [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=995.2800000000001s)]
*  be a degree more subtle like we've talked about, like flying around the Gulf and trying to shake [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1000.8000000000001s)]
*  down some very rich countries for some money for Jared and things like that. So it's just another [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1006.32s)]
*  indication of how much all these characters know Trump's there for four years. And they're all just [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1012.48s)]
*  looking to squeeze whatever they can, whatever juice they can out of this. But you know, Cash [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1017.2s)]
*  Patel, a deputy FBI, it's not comforting. That's a very important position that helps run the Federal [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1022.5600000000001s)]
*  Bureau of Investigation. He could do a lot of damage there. It seems like that's where this is headed. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1029.2s)]
*  And I just got a name, Tommy, something that always bugs me. It's not like the FBI is some [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1033.84s)]
*  left-wing organization. When I was there, I thought it was the most right-wing collection of people in [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1037.36s)]
*  the government. So I don't know who they're purging. But beyond the people that have already left, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1043.1999999999998s)]
*  I can't even remember the name of the two FBI agents who had an affair that Trump hates. But [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1051.36s)]
*  I'm sure Cash Patel will find things to investigate, people to go after, and that's not good. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1056.72s)]
*  FBI is a bunch of white guys that love law enforcement. It's a pretty conservative [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1062.0800000000002s)]
*  organization. I'm just trying to imagine the Obama transition in 2008. It's like guys like you and me [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1065.92s)]
*  who are relatively young but been around for a while, going up to Tim Geithner being like, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1070.88s)]
*  yo, if you give us 100 grand a month, we'll talk you up in the press. That's what's happening here. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1074.8s)]
*  Whatever. But again, so another bit of Trump news. Obviously, every president at this point is a lame [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1080.0800000000002s)]
*  duck when there's an incoming administration. But Trump is really just assuming power and [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1088.24s)]
*  crowding out Biden in ways that I don't know that we've seen before. One such example came last night [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1093.36s)]
*  when Trump, I think, just tweeted it. He put out a statement or tweeted that he wants to put 25% [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1099.1200000000001s)]
*  tariffs on Mexico and Canada, and then an additional 10% tariff on all products coming in from China. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1104.64s)]
*  The rationale was, quote, this tariff will remain in effect until such time as drugs, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1111.04s)]
*  in particular fentanyl, and all illegal aliens stop this invasion of our country, end quote. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1115.76s)]
*  These tariffs would upend the USMCA trade agreement that Trump negotiated with Mexico [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1122.32s)]
*  and Canada just a few years ago in the first term. According to the Wall Street Journal, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1127.28s)]
*  the USMCA trade agreement covered $1.8 trillion worth of goods in 2022 alone. So this is a lot [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1131.84s)]
*  of stuff. The economic impact would be huge. The Canadian government told the journal that [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1138.56s)]
*  Ottawa buys more stuff from the US than China, Japan, France, and the UK combined. Mexico, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1143.12s)]
*  China, and Canada account for over 40% of imports to the US this year so far. So long story short, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1148.7199999999998s)]
*  putting these huge tariffs in place would have a major economic impact. The president of Mexico, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1154.6399999999999s)]
*  Claudia Schoenbaum, responded to Trump Tuesday morning saying basically, OK, if you did that, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1159.9199999999998s)]
*  we'd have to retaliate. It would hurt businesses. She also pointed out that the drug trade requires [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1165.04s)]
*  supply and demand and the US is causing the demand problem and that 70% of illegal weapons [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1169.84s)]
*  seized from criminals in Mexico come from the US. So she's getting a little spicy. Justin Trudeau [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1175.76s)]
*  in Canada spoke with Trump after this statement went out. I think he offered more of a low key [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1181.4399999999998s)]
*  response. But Ben, I think what's notable about this to me is the way the markets and the media [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1186.0s)]
*  are kind of brushing it off a little bit. Trump has made a lot of threats like this. I hope the [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1192.0s)]
*  reaction so far is an indication of a less hair on fire approach to covering this administration. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1197.44s)]
*  Or maybe they're just all thinking, well, it could be worse. It could be a 60% [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1203.76s)]
*  tariff on China like he's talked about before. But I don't know. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1207.52s)]
*  First of all, we always say this. It's a version of what you just said. But it's pretty bizarre [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1210.64s)]
*  for the president-elect to start a trade war two months before he takes office. But I guess the [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1216.3200000000002s)]
*  norms are things that don't exist anymore. But we have to be aware of this. We have to be aware [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1222.0s)]
*  that this is not normal. So just posit that. In terms of what Trump's trying to do, I think, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1227.6s)]
*  is he links all these things into one transaction. So he's putting tariffs, which are an economic [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1233.84s)]
*  penalty in place. But what he wants from Mexico, I think, is to essentially crack down on border [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1239.52s)]
*  the northern border, our southern border. So the deployment of the Mexican National Guard, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1247.2s)]
*  which is now part of the Mexican military, actually, to stop migrants before they get there. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1252.48s)]
*  And I guess in some bank shot on fentanyl, the Mexicans doing more to crack down on fentanyl, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1258.4s)]
*  the Chinese doing more to crack down on precursors of fentanyl. This is all quite [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1264.16s)]
*  complicated stuff, though. Mexican cartels are famously the move if you tariff them. They care [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1267.76s)]
*  a lot about trade duties and taxes and things like that. It's just not even makes sense. It's [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1273.36s)]
*  such a bank shot, but sorry to cut you off. That's right. It's a huge bank shot. And so [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1278.3999999999999s)]
*  we'll see. He may be able to squeeze Mexico to do certain things at the border. But the reality that [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1282.7199999999998s)]
*  people have to understand is this is a tax on Americans. We litigated this in the campaign. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1287.6s)]
*  The price is not paid by Mexico. It's not like they pay extra on imports. It's 20% that is going [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1293.9199999999998s)]
*  to be passed to the American consumer because they're going to have to pay an extra price for [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1299.28s)]
*  what's coming across the border. Mexico is our biggest trading partner. Canada, a huge trading [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1303.44s)]
*  partner. China, a huge trading partner. This is very inflationary. And the longer these tariffs [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1307.36s)]
*  stay in place, the more it's going to have inflationary pressure. Prices are going to go [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1312.8799999999999s)]
*  up in this country. So all those people who voted because they're pissed about inflation, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1317.04s)]
*  kind of voted for policies that raise prices, including on things like food, right? A lot of [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1320.56s)]
*  food comes in from Mexico. And then if there's reprisal tariffs, which they certainly will be, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1324.64s)]
*  well, that's going to make it harder for US exporters. So if this is quick, if this is like [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1330.24s)]
*  he puts the tariffs in place and squeezes something out and there's an agreement within a few weeks, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1334.72s)]
*  then I think it's not that disruptive. But if these tariffs kind of become a new normal, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1340.4s)]
*  it's going to create all kinds of economic pressures. And another thing it's going to do [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1346.3200000000002s)]
*  is it's going to incentivize a country like Mexico to get closer to China, to countries that don't do [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1350.16s)]
*  things like this. And so I think the US is going to be economically isolated over time. And China [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1355.76s)]
*  is going to become more of a center of gravity here, as well as other countries. So welcome to [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1361.0400000000002s)]
*  the new Trump normal here. Yeah. And once again, we're in a position where the long term economic [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1365.44s)]
*  impact could be really bad and really devastating. But in the short term, a headline that's like Trump [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1370.96s)]
*  threatens major action on Mexico over fentanyl, like that's a great headline. I'm sure it's wildly [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1376.08s)]
*  popular. People will like it. It's still soft short of some of the things they talked about in the [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1382.1599999999999s)]
*  campaign, like sending the US military to conduct airstrikes on whatever cartel he mentioned at the [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1386.72s)]
*  time. So yeah, we'll see. It's probably smart politics, but yeah, kind of crazy. Yeah. And [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1394.48s)]
*  you're right. This is the key question for all these things. Is this the first step of a slippery [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1400.4s)]
*  slope that could lead to more terrorists or to your point could lead all the way to military [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1405.8400000000001s)]
*  action Mexico? Or is this kind of the thing that he's going to do and get the headline? [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1409.92s)]
*  And that's to me the meta question of the second Trump term is how much this stuff spirals. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1414.3200000000002s)]
*  You know, absolutely. All right. So let's turn back to Israel because there was another major [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1419.2800000000002s)]
*  development last week, which is the fact that the International Criminal Court or ICC issued an arrest [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1423.2800000000002s)]
*  warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Galant. It was [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1429.28s)]
*  for committing war crimes like using starvation as a weapon of war and directing strikes against [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1434.8s)]
*  civilians, both in Gaza. This is the first time we've seen the ICC issue an arrest warrant for a [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1440.0s)]
*  Western leader. And it means both men could risk arrest if they travel to any of the 124 countries [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1444.96s)]
*  that are members of the ICC. Remember the US and Israel did not sign the Rome statute and are not [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1451.12s)]
*  parties to the ICC. So we're not under this. We wouldn't fall under this agreement. Netanyahu and [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1456.72s)]
*  most of the Israeli government reacted with outrage. They said the charges were wrong on [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1462.48s)]
*  the facts and equated the Israeli government with Hamas because the ICC also put forward some [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1467.2s)]
*  charges against some Hamas figures, I believe. Many politicians in the US denounced the ICC as [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1472.64s)]
*  well, including the Biden White House, which called the arrest warrants outrageous. And then [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1478.32s)]
*  Trump's incoming national security advisor said the ICC has no credibility and said to expect a [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1482.8s)]
*  strong response from the Trump team when they take over in January. Many people have pointed out, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1487.6s)]
*  Ben, how US officials welcomed the ICC arrest warrant against Vladimir Putin, but are now [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1492.48s)]
*  denouncing the court as lawless. So it looks very hypocritical. So Ben, in practice, obviously this [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1497.84s)]
*  will make Netanyahu and Galant more physically isolated because they won't want to risk traveling [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1505.12s)]
*  to certain countries. For example, every member of the European Union is part of the ICC. So we'll [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1509.68s)]
*  see if those countries all enforce this ruling. It'll make Israel more isolated diplomatically [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1515.28s)]
*  and culturally. It creates political challenges internally in some countries. The Germans are now [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1520.88s)]
*  going to decide whether they are going to enforce an arrest warrant. But on the Trump piece, back in [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1525.44s)]
*  2020, Trump issued an executive order sanctioning ICC officials that went after Israeli or US [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1533.12s)]
*  officials. I'm guessing their reaction now will be similar. They'll probably try to punish the ICC [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1539.6s)]
*  rather than seek any accountability for Netanyahu. But I mean, with the caveat that obviously getting [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1545.84s)]
*  charged with war crimes is a huge deal for anyone in practice, how significant do you think this is [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1552.0s)]
*  for Netanyahu, Galant, and the current government? I think it's significant. And one of the ways you [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1557.84s)]
*  know it is that they wouldn't respond so hyperbolically if they were concerned about it. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1563.28s)]
*  There's the practical significance, as you said, that countries that are party to this, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1569.36s)]
*  which are most countries in the world, are obligated to arrest Netanyahu or Galant if they [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1572.9599999999998s)]
*  travel there. And that's not nothing, right? I mean, but even if he doesn't end up in The Hague, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1578.0s)]
*  this will always follow him around. It never goes away. And the ICC is the most important global [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1583.76s)]
*  body when it comes to the prosecution of war crimes. And frankly, the fact that they did this [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1592.32s)]
*  despite the Trump election, this was a prosecutor who made a request to judges. The prosecutor was [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1597.44s)]
*  informed by an expert panel that included, by the way, a 91-year-old Holocaust surviving Israeli. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1603.52s)]
*  Mm-hmm. Then it was these judges making this decision to approve the arrest warrants [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1609.44s)]
*  after the Trump election. I think that this is actually going to give the ICC a lot of credibility [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1614.72s)]
*  in the rest of the world, in the global south in particular, where there have been complaints for [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1620.48s)]
*  a long time that the ICC always goes after African dictators for war crimes, but never [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1624.96s)]
*  white people or Westerners. The fact that they did this knowing that they were going to have [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1632.88s)]
*  a ton of bricks fall on them from Congress and from the Trump people, I think shows that they [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1637.12s)]
*  were calling balls and strikes. Look, the easiest way to not get prosecuted for war crimes by the [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1641.6s)]
*  International Criminal Court is not to commit war crimes. Mm-hmm. Best practices. Yeah. But yeah, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1646.56s)]
*  we talked about this at length. They've been using starvation as a weapon. They announced it [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1650.32s)]
*  as a tactic that they were going to squeeze Gaza. They've been restricting aid. Over 20,000 children [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1656.2399999999998s)]
*  have been killed in Gaza. Those are not combatants in Hamas. This is something that has a short and [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1662.24s)]
*  medium term inconvenience to Israel, but is a long term, I think, stain on Netanyahu and frankly on [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1670.48s)]
*  this government in Israel. The sanctions, they could turn a dial up if they really want to. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1679.44s)]
*  They can try to make it impossible for the ICC to investigate other war crimes by restricting [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1687.28s)]
*  their travel, by trying to sanction third countries that cooperate with ICC investigations. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1693.76s)]
*  They could really try to disrupt the court, which just think of how that would look, Tommy. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1699.44s)]
*  Because you're vindictive about this, you're going to stop the investigation of other war crimes. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1704.32s)]
*  This is beyond hypocrisy. This is now into the US being a shield. If we cripple the ICC, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1710.56s)]
*  we become a shield not just for Netanyahu, but to all war crimes everywhere because we're trying to [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1716.72s)]
*  neuter the body that the world came together to create to do it. I'm pessimistic about where this [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1722.4s)]
*  is going, but I think it's going to show how out of step the US is with international opinion. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1730.24s)]
*  Yeah. Holding up the liberal international order once again. There's another really important story [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1734.16s)]
*  out of Israel that's about press freedom and the future of their democracy. Listeners that probably [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1739.3600000000001s)]
*  heard us talking about an Israeli newspaper or news outlet called Haaretz on the show a bunch, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1744.4s)]
*  because one, I can't pronounce it correctly and everyone makes fun of me. Second, it's a left [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1750.48s)]
*  leaning independent newspaper in Israel that has long been critical of Netanyahu and is also one of [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1755.2s)]
*  the few outlets in Israel that really covers the impact of the war in Gaza on the people living [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1762.0s)]
*  there. If you talk to Israelis or people who go to Israel, they'll tell you they're always struck [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1767.8400000000001s)]
*  by how much the news is still about October 7th or IDF casualties or stories about the hostages. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1771.68s)]
*  All real important stories, but there's very little coverage of just the nightmare of life [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1779.44s)]
*  on the ground in Gaza and the impact on the Palestinian people. However, now Haaretz's future [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1784.24s)]
*  is in doubt because on Sunday, the Israeli cabinet voted to sanction it. That means that they're [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1791.52s)]
*  going to cut off all government advertising in Haaretz. They're going to cancel subscriptions [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1796.3200000000002s)]
*  for state employees and for those who work at state owned companies. So it's a real revenue hit. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1800.88s)]
*  The Netanyahu government was particularly mad by comments made by the publisher of the paper, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1804.88s)]
*  Amos Shaken, who said in October, the Netanyahu government doesn't care about imposing a cruel [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1809.92s)]
*  apartheid regime on the Palestinian population. It dismisses the costs of both sides for defending [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1815.1200000000001s)]
*  the settlements while fighting the Palestinian freedom fighters that Israel calls terrorists. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1820.5600000000002s)]
*  Shaken later clarified that he was not referring to Hamas as freedom fighters, but you can understand [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1825.68s)]
*  why that word choice did not go over well in lots of parts of Israel. In that speech, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1830.48s)]
*  he also called for sanctions on Israel and its leaders to end the war. So there were obviously [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1836.32s)]
*  those discreet comments made by the publisher in that speech, but the people driving this effort [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1842.8s)]
*  to sanction Haaretz were also very clear that they were just generally pissed about their coverage of [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1847.1200000000001s)]
*  the war. So Haaretz responded by saying, quote, like his friends Putin, Erdogan and Orban and [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1851.3600000000001s)]
*  Netanyahu who is trying to silence a critical independent newspaper, Haaretz will not balk [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1857.12s)]
*  and will not morph into a government pamphlet that publishes messages approved by the government [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1861.52s)]
*  and its leader. We caught up with Anat Saragusti. She's a veteran Israeli journalist and currently [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1865.68s)]
*  in charge of press freedom at the Union of Journalists in Israel. She spoke about how [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1871.6s)]
*  this move is part of a broader campaign to attack press freedom by Netanyahu's government. Let's [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1875.52s)]
*  listen. The decision to boycott Haaretz by imposing sanctions on it and forbid the use of public funds [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1880.0s)]
*  for advertising or subscribing to the paper is not a standalone event. It is part of a well [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1886.8s)]
*  crafted master plan to weaken and then destroy the free press and independent media in Israel. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1893.68s)]
*  The master plan plays out in several dimensions. The legislation dimension, new laws target the [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1900.1599999999999s)]
*  independence of Israel's media outlets. Some proposed laws focus on the public broadcasting [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1907.36s)]
*  media. Others aim to grant political players with authority to shut down media outlets [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1914.32s)]
*  that endanger the security of the state. A very broad definition. If passed, these bills would [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1920.08s)]
*  effectively give political leaders the right and power to shut down any news outlet that doesn't [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1927.04s)]
*  totally align with the government. Ben, this attack on Haaretz also comes just a few months [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1933.4399999999998s)]
*  after the Israeli government raided and shut down Al Jazeera offices in Israel and the West Bank. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1940.56s)]
*  It seems like it's a pretty remarkable attack on press freedom that is following the Victor [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1946.8s)]
*  Orban playbook to a T and you're not really hearing denunciations from the State Department [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1950.32s)]
*  or other places, are you? No. There have not been a lot of profiles and courage on anything related [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1956.08s)]
*  to Israel and the United States government under Joe Biden, which is a part of his legacy, [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1963.52s)]
*  essentially running interference for the strangling of Israeli democracy by Bibi Netanyahu. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1968.4s)]
*  So I'm just going to name that. This is really extraordinary. I mean, Haaretz is an illustrious [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1974.56s)]
*  newspaper. It's like the oldest paper thing, right? And yeah, it's to the left, but I mean, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1980.8s)]
*  to Americans, I don't know, this isn't even like gray zone or, you know, this isn't some super left [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1986.0800000000002s)]
*  outlet, right? This is, you know, left to center opinion that people, you know, in Tel Aviv and [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1992.96s)]
*  around the world read, right? And you're right. This is the Orban playbook to a T. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=1998.4s)]
*  You intimidate media, you try to force them, you bend them to your will, you use state funds, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2004.0800000000002s)]
*  state sanctions. I recently watched a documentary people should check out on streaming, Tom, [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2009.0400000000002s)]
*  you'd like it called Bibi Files, where they got the deposition tapes of Bibi and all of his criminal [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2013.92s)]
*  trials. And keep in mind, one of the criminal trials was basically about him and his son, [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2019.28s)]
*  you know, leaning on the biggest website in Israel for news, and literally getting down into the [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2023.6s)]
*  weeds of trying to pick their editor and telling them what content and what pictures to use. And [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2028.32s)]
*  he wants to control the media. And he's following the playbook of Orban. In this country, we see [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2034.56s)]
*  some that already. I mean, that's another thing to think about is how far will Trump go? He's [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2038.8799999999999s)]
*  threatened people, people's licenses, you know, MSNBC and others to their broadcast licenses. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2042.48s)]
*  So we should be aware that this is a trend across the board. But on Israel, like people just need [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2047.52s)]
*  to stop and think about this. This is literally sanctioning newspapers for things that you don't [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2052.56s)]
*  like. And so when people want to use the talking point about Israel's only democracy in the Middle [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2057.84s)]
*  East or whatever, ask, you know, someone who lives in the occupied territories or ask someone who [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2064.16s)]
*  works at Haaretz whether this feels like a democracy, you know. And I say that with all [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2069.04s)]
*  humility, because I don't think the United States is going to feel entirely like a democracy at [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2073.12s)]
*  times in the next four years. But this you're right, this is something that should be getting [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2077.7599999999998s)]
*  more attention. Yeah, it'll be a big revenue hit for the paper. Hopefully they can recoup some of [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2080.72s)]
*  those losses by the international attention that will come from what people seeing this attack and [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2085.7599999999998s)]
*  finding it offensive and subscribing. But I do think it's really important. And it's worth [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2090.72s)]
*  highlighting that Israel has a robust censorship censorship process for any national security story [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2094.64s)]
*  that can keep certain reporting out of the press. Generally, that's why, you know, there's this big [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2101.76s)]
*  scandal happening right now where people are wondering whether Bibi Ninyahu directed one of [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2106.8s)]
*  his aides to leak classified information that seemed to back up, you know, some of his approach [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2111.5200000000004s)]
*  to hostage negotiations with Hamas. And that aid had to leak that information to a German newspaper [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2117.5200000000004s)]
*  because it couldn't get through the sort of Israeli censorship regime. So there's a concerning [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2124.48s)]
*  trajectory here, Ben. It's not just the war. It's not just these sanctions on harets. It's also [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2129.28s)]
*  the attack on the judiciary that happened just a couple of years ago, like a lot of [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2134.6400000000003s)]
*  blinking lights here for Israel's democracy. And let's just point out that this was for speech, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2139.1200000000003s)]
*  right? This is something they didn't, you know, they didn't like what the publisher said. They [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2144.96s)]
*  didn't like some of the stories that they were writing or the opinion that they were writing [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2149.6000000000004s)]
*  about the war. Tommy, do you think that the free speech stands, Elon and all the Silicon Valley [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2153.36s)]
*  bros who are harping on about free speech are going to rally to the defense of harets and [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2160.1600000000003s)]
*  in the Israeli media? I don't know. You know, I haven't looked. I would also [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2165.52s)]
*  love to know what like Barry Weiss is up to on this one. I'm not someone who's been probably [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2168.1600000000003s)]
*  very fond of harets as general coverage, but maybe I could be wrong. I'll take a look after the show. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2172.8s)]
*  But yeah, a story worth watching. Ben, so another sort of big piece of the kind of outbox legacy [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2179.2s)]
*  of the Biden administration is Ukraine in the war there. Last week, we talked about their 11th hour [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2185.2799999999997s)]
*  decision to let Ukraine hit targets in Russian territory with US made weapons and the ways in [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2190.3999999999996s)]
*  which that Ukraine had started to do that with these attack on missiles and other things. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2195.2s)]
*  The Russians decided to respond pretty quickly and show their displeasure by escalating and [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2199.52s)]
*  firing back Ukraine with what's been described as an experimental medium range ballistic missile. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2205.44s)]
*  What makes this kind of missile so dangerous is that it can carry a nuclear warhead. It can be [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2210.64s)]
*  outfitted with multiple warheads. Apparently this missile had six warheads. I don't know if it was a [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2215.52s)]
*  MIRV system, which lets the warheads reenter the atmosphere and then target different locations, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2220.08s)]
*  but it was very sophisticated, six warheads. And then according to Putin, the missile traveled at [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2224.4s)]
*  up to 10 times the speed of sound. So there was no Western air defense that could stop it. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2230.4s)]
*  Putin said in a speech last week, quote, I would recommend the ruling elites of the countries that [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2235.2s)]
*  are hatching plans to use their military contingents against Russia to seriously think about it. And [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2239.2799999999997s)]
*  then Russia's deputy foreign minister said this week that Russia could deploy short and medium [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2244.3199999999997s)]
*  range missiles in the Asia Pacific region. So again, more very worrisome saber rattling there [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2248.56s)]
*  and also just real escalation in the forms of these cross border attacks. I think you and I [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2253.8399999999997s)]
*  have assumed that when Trump takes office, he'll basically force the Ukrainians to cut a peace deal [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2260.08s)]
*  but I did want to play for you this recent clip of the aforementioned incoming Trump [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2265.2s)]
*  counterterrorism czar, Seb Gorka on, I don't know, some TV show somewhere. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2271.6s)]
*  I'll give one tip away that the president has mentioned. He will say to that murderous former [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2275.7599999999998s)]
*  KGB Colonel, that thug who runs the Russian Federation, you will negotiate now or the aid [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2280.88s)]
*  that we have given to Ukraine thus far will look like peanuts. That's how he will force those [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2288.64s)]
*  gentlemen to come to an arrangement that stops the bloodshed. What do you think, man? I don't [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2295.44s)]
*  think Joe Rogan is going to like that answer. Gorka. It's funny when you started to play the [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2301.04s)]
*  clip and he started to trash somebody. I didn't know whether he was going to go Putin or Zelensky. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2305.2s)]
*  You never know what disguise, right? So true. It's kind of a surprise twist there. I don't think [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2310.9599999999996s)]
*  Seb Gorka is going to be the guy whispering in Trump's ear on Ukraine. Nor do I. Look, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2316.64s)]
*  what is distressing about what's happening is Biden people are lifting all these restrictions. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2320.56s)]
*  They can fire on Western targets. They also lifted the ban on the use of anti-personnel mines [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2324.56s)]
*  inside of Ukraine, which is a huge deal. It's a big deal. The US has spent decades trying to [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2329.9199999999996s)]
*  fortify the norm against the use of landmines. So that goes out the window. Russia responding in [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2335.6s)]
*  kind. Part of this is tit for tat, but part of this I think is both sides are going to try to [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2341.2799999999997s)]
*  do as much as they can in the next two months to put themselves in the strongest position heading [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2345.36s)]
*  into this incoming Trump negotiation that is going to commence. And it's worrisome because [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2351.36s)]
*  we're just in this escalatory period in the war at a time when it's frankly not going well for [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2357.6s)]
*  Ukraine to begin with. This is the kind of missile that makes me long for arms control, Tommy. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2362.64s)]
*  Me too. Maybe shredding all the arms control agreements of the post-Cold War period, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2367.12s)]
*  which is something that George W. Bush and Donald Trump with John Bolton as national [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2371.3599999999997s)]
*  adviser and Putin have done. So now we're suddenly using ICBMs. That's never a good thing. It just [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2377.12s)]
*  shows you how much they're goodbye, liberal or national order. There are no norms on the [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2382.7999999999997s)]
*  use of these types of missiles. So it's a lot to be concerned about. I think it's preparing for the [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2388.7999999999997s)]
*  Trump team. And one personnel point is that there have been these trial balloons of Rick Grinnell, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2394.16s)]
*  a friend of the pod, who most notably of recent was negotiating with Jared Kushner on real [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2400.16s)]
*  state developments in Albania. So I don't know if he's bringing in the anti-corruption mindset to [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2407.8399999999997s)]
*  these negotiations. But I just think it's going to be harder than the Trump team obviously suggested [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2414.64s)]
*  of ending the war on day one. Yeah, they can cut off arms to Ukraine, but they can't make them [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2419.2799999999997s)]
*  stop fighting. They can't make them be an insurgency. They can't make the Europeans stop supplying with [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2423.44s)]
*  them with certain kinds of weapons. I'm really glad you mentioned the landmines thing. I'd [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2427.6s)]
*  forgotten to include that, but you're right. That's a big deal in significant backsliding in [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2430.56s)]
*  terms of an effort to get just truly awful weapons off of battlefields. Because the problem with [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2434.7999999999997s)]
*  these mines is they can linger for decades and little kids run over them and lose feet and hands [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2438.96s)]
*  or die. And it's just horrific. Also, Ben, you're right to mention the arms control piece. I think [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2444.64s)]
*  this kind of missile that Putin launched at Ukraine would have been covered under the INF [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2450.0s)]
*  treaty. Now, obviously we're not naive here. We're not suggesting that Putin's been following all [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2455.92s)]
*  these treaty obligations recently. But the US withdrew from the INF treaty in 2019 under the [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2460.16s)]
*  Trump administration. Under the Trump administration. So these things have a tail. There's a cost [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2466.64s)]
*  over time to shredding these things. Yes. Okay. Let's switch gears, Ben, to another massive [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2471.2799999999997s)]
*  challenge, which is climate change. So the COP29 UN climate summit is finally complete. It was not [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2476.08s)]
*  great. There were serious concerns about the process, the fact that it was in Azerbaijan [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2481.44s)]
*  to begin with. There were reports that the Saudis were unilaterally editing negotiating texts, which [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2486.08s)]
*  is not supposed to happen. The big picture goal of the summit was to get developed countries to [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2491.2s)]
*  cough up some money to help developing countries transition to a clean energy economy and deal [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2497.52s)]
*  with the impacts of climate change that are already harming them. On that front, the parties announced [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2502.3199999999997s)]
*  a non-binding commitment for rich countries to contribute $300 billion a year by 2035, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2507.8399999999997s)]
*  which is three times the current $100 billion target, but far short of the 1.3 trillion that [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2513.7599999999998s)]
*  experts say is needed to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. Ben, I don't know, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2519.44s)]
*  better than nothing, I guess, but I just came away from this COP and the last COP [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2526.2400000000002s)]
*  wondering if I should continue to have faith in the process and anxious about Trump taking [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2531.2000000000003s)]
*  over the reins. But I don't know. Anything that jumped out at you? I think on the process point, [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2536.32s)]
*  it's clear that the COP process has been captured by the fossil fuel industry. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2540.8s)]
*  The last two summits were in the UAE and now Azerbaijan, obviously major fossil fuel [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2546.0s)]
*  producers. But even more than that, the fossil fuel companies flood the zone with lobbyists. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2553.04s)]
*  They're taking the pen. The Saudi edits were all about kind of defending fossil fuel interests. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2559.2s)]
*  Brazil hosts next year. That's a much bigger improvement. I think that the UN and Brazil [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2564.24s)]
*  as a host need to take a look at this process and make sure that it's climate people driving [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2570.0s)]
*  the train and not the fossil fuel industry. Sure, you need those people at the table to make a [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2575.36s)]
*  transition. Also, there was such a crackdown on civil society. It's useful to have activists [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2579.76s)]
*  protesting outside of COPs. I was there at Glasgow a few years ago where there were like tens of [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2585.84s)]
*  thousands of protesters. That put pressure on the people inside the room to be more ambitious. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2590.88s)]
*  There were no protesters, no activists allowed in a place like Azerbaijan. That was missing too. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2595.92s)]
*  Yes, this number was whittled down. I would be unsatisfied with it if I was in a country that [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2601.52s)]
*  is suffering the effects of climate change. Ambition is going to have to go up at a time [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2607.28s)]
*  when Donald Trump's withdrawing from the agreement or pledging to at least. Other people are [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2610.96s)]
*  unfortunately going to have to step up here. Inside the United States, obviously, states are [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2616.7200000000003s)]
*  going to have to step up to defend certain clean energy policies. Yes. Speaking of crackdowns and [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2620.48s)]
*  civil society, Ben, last week, there were reports that 45 political prisoners were sentenced to [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2626.48s)]
*  prison in Hong Kong, which is the latest indication that even advocating on behalf of democracy is [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2632.96s)]
*  now going to be treated as a crime by the Chinese government in Hong Kong. The crime, in air quotes [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2639.04s)]
*  there is that back in 2020, these individuals either helped put together or ran in an unofficial [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2644.24s)]
*  primary designed to help unify the pro-democracy groups ahead of local elections. But I guess in [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2650.56s)]
*  doing so, they ran afoul of this draconian national security law put in place after Hong Kong's mass [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2657.12s)]
*  protests in 2019. We spoke with activist Nathan Law. He was a former legislator in Hong Kong who [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2662.3199999999997s)]
*  now lives in exile in London about the prisoners and the state of democracy in Hong Kong. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2668.56s)]
*  Just look at what these 45 people have done. They ran a primary election in which it is such a [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2674.8799999999997s)]
*  mundane practice for every party in democratic countries. Some organized it, some ran as a [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2683.2799999999997s)]
*  participant. And then the government says that, oh, you ran a primary election, you wanted to get a [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2689.04s)]
*  majority in the legislature, you wanted to block government's bill, including the budget. You want [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2695.04s)]
*  to prioritize the government so that you're committing an act of subverting the state. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2701.2s)]
*  So this kind of logic doesn't really make sense, but that is exactly what the government wanted [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2706.72s)]
*  to send the message. The idea of having a monopoly of power is to do whatever outrageous and ridiculous [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2713.04s)]
*  things. No one can hold them accountable. And this is exactly what happened. Many of these defendants [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2721.2799999999997s)]
*  have actually been in jail since 2021. The majority chose to plead guilty for more lenient [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2726.4s)]
*  sentences. The longest sentence given was 10 years in prison. So Ben, Hong Kong's democracy was [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2731.84s)]
*  crushed after these protests during the Trump administration. Things obviously didn't get any [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2738.88s)]
*  better the last four years during the Biden administration. It's hard now to see a viable [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2743.12s)]
*  path forward for those who want to see democracy in Hong Kong. But I do fear, [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2748.56s)]
*  the incoming Trump administration is full of China hawks. But the things that Trump cares about are [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2755.68s)]
*  economic forces, tariffs, military development. I just worry that any kind of democracy or human [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2762.48s)]
*  rights related question could end up being something he just trades away. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2769.68s)]
*  Yeah. And I think on these sentences, I wrote about the Hong Kong protest movement in my last [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2773.44s)]
*  book after the fall. And a lot of these types of people are now being prosecuted. And the reality [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2779.36s)]
*  is that one, it's a human tragedy. I mean, these are people that are losing, in some cases, more [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2785.76s)]
*  than a decade of their life in prison for pretty mundane activities of running for local office, [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2790.64s)]
*  or advocating for democracy, or being in the kind of freer media. And that's not a coincidence. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2796.7200000000003s)]
*  The targeting of people that are kind of pro civil society, or pro democracy, or media outlets [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2802.56s)]
*  that report on this, that's intended to kind of squelch that entirely. So beyond punishing these [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2809.44s)]
*  people, the message is nobody's allowed to do that anymore. There's no criticism of the government [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2813.92s)]
*  allowed. There's no kind of freedom of speech allowed. And it's an effort to make Hong Kong, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2818.96s)]
*  which was supposed to be this separate system, just another Chinese city, that all the rules [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2823.68s)]
*  are the same as they would be in mainland China. That's the effect of what's happening. There's a [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2829.04s)]
*  major trial coming up of a guy named Jimmy Lai, who ran Apple Daily, which is the biggest kind [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2832.64s)]
*  of more independent newspaper there. That's kind of the final piece of this message that's being [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2836.72s)]
*  sent. I don't think that the Trump people, even with all these hawks, are going to do anything [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2841.12s)]
*  about that. I mean, they could, in their big transactionalism, say, if you want to get out [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2844.56s)]
*  from under these tariffs, we want to see these people freed from prison. But I doubt that's a [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2849.92s)]
*  priority for them. Yeah, I do too. Okay, we can't end this episode without talking about at least [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2854.88s)]
*  one big L for an autocrat around the world. So that's going to bring us to Jair Bolsonaro, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2860.08s)]
*  the former right-wing president of Brazil. After he lost to the current president, Lula da Silva, [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2864.56s)]
*  back in 2022, Bolsonaro refused to concede. And now Brazil's federal police have recommended that [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2869.76s)]
*  he, along with 36 other people, be charged with planning a coup to stay in office. The police have [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2875.84s)]
*  made the recommendation to Brazil's attorney general, who will now have to decide whether or [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2881.84s)]
*  not to formally charge Bolsonaro. This is the result of a sprawling investigation that took [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2886.08s)]
*  two years. It produced a 700-page report and comes a couple days after five people, one of whom was [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2891.2000000000003s)]
*  an aide to Bolsonaro, were arrested for plotting to assassinate Lula in 2022. Bolsonaro is also under [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2897.1200000000003s)]
*  investigation for ordering an official to falsify his and his daughter's COVID vaccine records [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2903.6000000000004s)]
*  before he traveled to the US and for smuggling jewelry gifted to Bolsonaro from Saudi Arabia [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2908.8s)]
*  in Bahrain. Bolsonaro had already been banned from running for office until 2030 as a result of yet [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2914.4s)]
*  another case where he'd spread misinformation about election fraud. Ben, it must be nice to live in a [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2919.6000000000004s)]
*  country where these former presidents who try to stage a coups have to face consequences. That [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2925.2000000000003s)]
*  feels like a good idea. Yeah, I don't know that Merrick Garland was the legal advisor to Lula on [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2929.52s)]
*  these ones. I mean, Tom, when I look back and think about the strangeness of if you are going [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2934.88s)]
*  to try to prosecute Trump for January 6, waiting years into the Biden term and doing it just in [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2940.08s)]
*  time for the investigations to run into the campaign was not exactly the most brilliant [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2946.7200000000003s)]
*  strategy. I think what we learned about from Lula is that if you want to be serious about [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2951.2000000000003s)]
*  democratic, the rule of law and democracy, there has to be accountability. And if you [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2957.04s)]
*  fuck around, you're going to find out. And that's what's been happening to Bolsonaro. He earned this [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2962.72s)]
*  through what he did too. This is not a politically vindictive prosecution. It was methodical and [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2968.56s)]
*  followed a number of people and obviously built a fact picture to get here. So you're right. It's a [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2974.96s)]
*  rare glimpse of how to push back on authoritarianism. I think another thing people point out, Tommy, is [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2983.04s)]
*  that both in terms of counter-authoritarianism and in terms of democracy, we don't often look [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2989.12s)]
*  to people like Lula. Because in the West, maybe we get too hyper-focused on the US and Europe. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=2997.2s)]
*  Maybe there's something we can learn from how in Brazil they're beating back literally exact same [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3003.68s)]
*  forces. I'm just thinking about what you talked about. You talked about Saudi jewels and [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3008.3199999999997s)]
*  misinformation and COVID denialism. Bolsonaro is swimming in the same stew as Don Jr. and Elon and [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3012.0s)]
*  our autocrats and oligarchs. Lula is doing something different and seems to be thus far [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3018.64s)]
*  working now. We'll see how the next election goes in Brazil. But we should be learning from [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3024.24s)]
*  the Brazilian example as much as we often look to countries in Europe for how they're dealing with [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3029.2s)]
*  this. Yeah, maybe because the Brazilians remember what it was like to be a military dictatorship [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3036.0s)]
*  because it was not that long ago. And they were more accurately aware of the threat than someone [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3040.16s)]
*  like Merrick Garland, who's I'm sure a brilliant jurist and a good guy, but at times seemed like [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3048.0s)]
*  somebody who was so desperate to be seen as nonpartisan and fair that all of a sudden we [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3053.28s)]
*  forgot the whole part of the job that was, I don't know, pursuing criminal activities and [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3058.72s)]
*  seeking accountability and justice. Remember that? Yeah, I don't know if Pam Bondi, is that her name? [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3063.28s)]
*  Pam Bondi. Yeah. I don't know how wedded she's going to be to norm defenses as Merrick Garland. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3068.56s)]
*  Pam Bondi, who famously was looking into fraud at Trump University in 2013, got a $25,000 check from [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3076.1600000000003s)]
*  Trump's trust or charity or whatever and then dropped the investigation. So no, I'm not [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3084.5600000000004s)]
*  hopeful that she's going to be someone who's scrupulous with her ethics and norms. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3090.0800000000004s)]
*  Finally, Ben, because America is once again going to be led by a draft dodger, [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3094.5600000000004s)]
*  we wanted to highlight a strange story about some attempted draft dodging in South Korea. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3098.48s)]
*  So the context for folks who don't know is ever since the Korean War, South Korea has mandatory [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3103.44s)]
*  conscription for all able-bodied men over 18. Those men have to serve in the army for at least [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3107.92s)]
*  18 months by the time they're 28 years old. But there was one creative young guy who tried to [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3112.96s)]
*  avoid his military service by binge eating before his final exam. We don't know how much weight he [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3118.56s)]
*  actually gained, but the end result was enough that he was ruled unfit to serve. Now here's where the [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3125.04s)]
*  story gets weird. First of all, this guy got sentenced to a year in prison, a year in prison. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3130.24s)]
*  Why not just enlist him until he's in shape and ready to rock? I don't understand that part. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3135.04s)]
*  And then second, even stranger, apparently he had a friend who, according to the government, helped [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3139.3599999999997s)]
*  him devise this binge eating plan. And that person was given a six months suspended sentence. How [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3145.12s)]
*  could that possibly be a crime? What kind of criminal knowledge do you need to say, [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3151.8399999999997s)]
*  eat bad for you stuff, lots of it, and don't exercise? In America, we just call that NFL Sundays. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3156.72s)]
*  Not exactly mastermind here. Maybe he was just trying to learn what it's like to be Kim Jong-un. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3162.96s)]
*  That's right. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3169.52s)]
*  He was perhaps just trying to put him in the shoes of the adversary. I don't know, but I assume he'll [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3170.24s)]
*  lose that weight in prison. But you got to admire the creativity here. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3175.92s)]
*  I do too. And what a fun way to get in trouble. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3180.32s)]
*  Hopefully he had some good meals on the way out. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3182.8s)]
*  Yeah, I hope it was delicious. It's funny because we have talked about the draft before. BTS, [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3184.96s)]
*  the K-pop band, they went on hiatus because I think a couple of them had to do their [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3188.72s)]
*  their compulsory service. I also was reading that there's big majorities of young men [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3192.64s)]
*  in South Korea who are unbelievably angry that women don't also have to do compulsory service. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3198.16s)]
*  I think there's a very low percentage of women who have actually volunteered to join the military. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3204.56s)]
*  So all these guys feel like they get roped into it. So interesting. It's sort of a broader, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3208.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't know, cultural challenge to explore. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3213.84s)]
*  Maybe we should send Pete Hegseth over there to get rid of these woke men. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3216.16s)]
*  Yes, we want women to serve. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3220.32s)]
*  That's right. Whip them into shape. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgXeJIh6eY&t=3221.68s)]
