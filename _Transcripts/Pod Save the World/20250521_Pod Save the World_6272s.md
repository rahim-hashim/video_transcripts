Video Description: Tommy and Ben discuss President Trump’s policy changes on Syria and his man-crush on its president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, what lifting sanctions on Syria could (and should) look like, more details on how Qatar’s plane bribe came together, and Tulsi Gabbard’s shocking politicization of the intelligence community. They also talk about the continuing crackdown on journalists and human rights activists by Nayib Bukele in El Salvador, the dire–and indefensible–humanitarian situation in Gaza, the lack of any meaningful progress in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, and elections in Portugal, Romania and Poland. Then, Ben speaks with Dr. Feroze Sidwha, a trauma surgeon who has volunteered twice in Gaza, about his experience treating patients in Khan Younis. Finally, Ben and Tommy are forced to endure some selections from this year’s Eurovision Song Contest.

# NEW: Qatar’s Prime Minister Denies $400M Jet Gift as ‘Bribery’ for Trump
**Pod Save the World:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k)
*  Welcome to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Ben Rhodes. And I'm feeling emotional today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=0.0s)]
*  There's some reports out that Bill Belichick, my former head coach, might be engaged to his much, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5.2s)]
*  much, much, much younger girlfriend. Is this your redirection for talking about the absolute [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=12.32s)]
*  dismantling the Celtics at the next day? You saw right through it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You did. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=16.8s)]
*  Congratulations to Bill Belichick. The age difference, notwithstanding. Yeah, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=21.68s)]
*  you probably shouldn't 3x or 4x your significant other. Everyone should read about the Bill [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  Belichick. Jordan Hudson saw guts quite. I think she's younger than Jalen Brunson, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=34.96s)]
*  just to connect this to the Knicks in some way that I can. How you feeling? When's the next game? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=39.36s)]
*  It's tomorrow night. So the night that this podcast airs, the Knicks will be winning game [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=42.96s)]
*  one against the Pacers. Is it in New York or in India? It's in New York. We are somehow hosting [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=47.36s)]
*  the Eastern Conference Finals. And I'm reliving my teenage years when we played the Pacers like [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=52.56s)]
*  four times in the conference finals. Should we do a GoFundMe to fly you out to a game? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=58.24s)]
*  I don't think that the collective listenership, as large as it is, could pay for a ticket at [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=62.96s)]
*  Mass Square. I saw that like a bad seat for game one of the NBA finals is over $2,000 already. It's [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=68.56s)]
*  crazy. Yeah, too great. I guess a lot of rich people in New York. Bill Belichick, though, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=74.32s)]
*  he's got some money. If he's listening, congratulations, Bill. He listens. And, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=78.96s)]
*  you know, you could pick up a ticket. Mazel tov, Bill, to new beginnings. We have a great show [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=83.91999999999999s)]
*  today. We're going to close the loop for you on Trump's corruption tour in the Middle East and [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=89.36s)]
*  his major Syria policy changes. We're also going to fill you in on the latest background we've [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=92.96s)]
*  learned about the Qatar's 747 sized bribe of the administration. Lots of interesting information [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=98.08s)]
*  there. Then we will talk about the shocking politicization of intelligence by Tulsi Gabbard, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=104.08s)]
*  a wave of oppression in El Salvador, the latest just ungodly awful news out of Gaza and why [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=109.6s)]
*  parts of Europe, countries in Europe are condemning the Israeli government's latest actions. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=116.96s)]
*  We'll talk about Trump seeming to give up on brokering peace in Ukraine and some big elections [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=122.0s)]
*  in Portugal, Romania, in Poland. And then we've promised that we will talk about Eurovision. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=127.12s)]
*  So we shall do that. And then Ben, you just did our interview today. What are folks going to hear? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=132.88s)]
*  Yeah, I talked to Feroz Sidwa, who is a trauma surgeon who has done two stints in Gaza. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=137.12s)]
*  So this is like a really important conversation that I think everybody needs to hear about what [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=145.2s)]
*  it's like to be, you know, in the middle of it in Gaza. And we hear some really harrowing stories. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=150.8s)]
*  We hear details that we never get to see about what it's actually like in Gaza. We talk about [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=161.12s)]
*  the likely undercount of the death count. We talk about the fact that, you know, I mean, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  just to give you a taste of the interview, you know, Feroz said his entire time there, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=173.6s)]
*  he maybe saw one combatant on the Hamas side. It was mainly children that he was treating. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=178.16s)]
*  We hear about some children. We get to know something about some of those children. So [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=184.4s)]
*  I really hope people stick around for this because it was one of the hardest, but most, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=189.2s)]
*  I don't know, necessary conversations I've had in a long time. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I wasn't in the interview, but I spent five minutes or so talking to him beforehand, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=198.39999999999998s)]
*  just chatting. And it's really valuable to hear someone's firsthand experience like that. Like, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=203.28s)]
*  we see it on the internet all day long. You see the videos. You see the read the stories. Sometimes [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=209.28s)]
*  they're so awful that there's like a part of your brain that wants to disbelieve it. You know what [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=215.12s)]
*  I mean? Because the horror is so real. But to have someone be like, I was a surgeon in a hospital and [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=219.84s)]
*  the following things happened to me. I don't know. It's just, it hits in a different way. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=226.0s)]
*  Well, yeah. I mean, one of the things we talk about is that, you know, what he saw, what he [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=232.0s)]
*  experienced, the people he interacted with, the nature of the injuries he treated, all point to why [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  people are not allowed to see what's happening in Gaza, why we don't have press on the ground in [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=243.92s)]
*  Gaza a year and a half into this. So that makes it even more important to hear stories like his, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=248.56s)]
*  because it's the only firsthand testimony that we can get absent. Yes, obviously some heroic [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=256.24s)]
*  reporting from Palestinians that we see on social media, and that's immensely valuable, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=263.2s)]
*  that kind of witness. This is from inside a hospital though. So I think it's a unique [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=269.52s)]
*  perspective. Yeah, absolutely. All right, Ben, well, we're going to talk about that. We're [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=274.47999999999996s)]
*  also going to talk about some political developments in Gaza, but let's start just by closing the loop [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=278.79999999999995s)]
*  on this Middle Eastern corruption bonanza from our president, Donald Trump. So the big news that we [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=282.24s)]
*  talked about last week was Trump promising to lift the crippling sanctions on Syria that were left [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=287.84s)]
*  over from the Assad regime. Actually, I think the first sanctions by the US on Syria were from like [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=291.91999999999996s)]
*  the 1970s. So there's decades of sanctions on this country. Trump met with Syria's interim [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=296.88s)]
*  president, Ahmed Al-Shara, in Saudi Arabia last Wednesday. The Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=301.92s)]
*  Salman joined them, as did Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan via telephone. Here's a clip of Trump on [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=307.04s)]
*  Fox News talking about his meeting with Al-Shara. I said, let's give him a chance. I met the leader. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=313.44s)]
*  I met the new leader and handsome guy, by the way, young, handsome. And I said, you know, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=319.76s)]
*  you have quite a past, got a tough past. But when you think about it, are you going to put a [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=328.48s)]
*  a choir boy in that position? I don't think so. You know, it's going to be a little bit tough. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=334.88s)]
*  It's a tough one. So you're willing to give him a shot. You know the word, they say it's a nasty [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=339.12s)]
*  neighborhood. It's a rough neighborhood. Yeah. And I, I thought it was really, yeah, I thought it was [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=342.32s)]
*  terrific. Tough past is one way to describe being a senior al-Qaeda leader. Ben, this is not the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=347.92s)]
*  most important thing we'll discuss, but I just would like you to imagine for a minute Brett [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=353.44s)]
*  Baer's face if he was interviewing Barack Obama and Obama was like, yo, that al-Qaeda guy, handsome [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=357.36s)]
*  guy, get it. Handsome guy. Yeah, really good looking guy. What do we do? Why is it the gilded [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=362.8s)]
*  lily about like the, this is so weird. It's like he's, he's on a casting call for everything. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=367.92s)]
*  Tough neighborhood. I don't know. Humans live there as far as I can tell. Anyway, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=374.8s)]
*  so after the meeting, Trump spoke to the press under first one. He claimed that Al-Sharah agreed [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=378.96000000000004s)]
*  to join the Abraham Accords, but said they first have to get themselves straightened up. We'll see. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=384.72s)]
*  The big question though for the Syrian people are all about sanctions relief. What does it mean in [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=388.64s)]
*  practice? When will it happen? Secretary of Suck Marco Rubio. I don't know. I don't know if that [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=394.0s)]
*  one works. He met with Syria's foreign minister last week. Afterwards, he talked about sanctions. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=399.52s)]
*  Here's a clip from Mr. Rubio. The core of these sanctions are statutory under the Caesar Act. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=404.32s)]
*  I've had members of Congress, Congress and both parties ask us to use the waivers authorities in [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=409.68s)]
*  that law. But, and that's what the president intends to do. Those waivers have to be renewed [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=415.59999999999997s)]
*  every 180 days. Ultimately, if we make enough progress, we'd like to see the law repealed [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=420.71999999999997s)]
*  because you're going to struggle to find people to invest in a country when any, in six months, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=426.24s)]
*  sanctions could come back. We're not there yet. That's premature. I think we want to start with [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=431.92s)]
*  the initial waiver, which will allow foreign partners who wanted to flow an aid to begin [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=436.32s)]
*  to do so without running the risk of sanctions. I think as we make progress, hopefully we'll be [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=440.96000000000004s)]
*  in a position soon or one day to go to Congress and ask them to permanently remove the sanctions. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=445.04s)]
*  Look on your face is preempting my question. So, Rubio there is mentioning the Caesar Act sanctions [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=450.72s)]
*  as are passed by Congress in 2019. Chris Murphy actually mentioned this to me last week as being [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=455.12s)]
*  a hurdle. So, Rubio there, he started talking about a phased approach to lifting sanctions [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=459.04s)]
*  that will first allow foreign governments to get aid into Syria that will probably not lead to an [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=465.68s)]
*  immediate private sector investments. You've also heard Qatar and Saudi Arabia say that they'll pay [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=470.24s)]
*  off Syria's debt to the World Bank, which will allow the World Bank to re-engage with Syria. So, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=476.96000000000004s)]
*  that's a good thing. The Syrian government also just signed an $800 million deal with an Emirati [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=481.28000000000003s)]
*  based logistics company to develop their port. So, hopefully that will help with some imports and [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=486.16s)]
*  exports. But Ben, I guess my question for you is, do you think this goes far enough? Is it [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=490.64000000000004s)]
*  unrealistic to think businesses would kind of rush into Syria and start investing anyway [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=496.64000000000004s)]
*  and therefore this makes sense? Or what do you think? First thing is, looks notwithstanding. If [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=503.04s)]
*  you think about Ahmed Alshara, like seven months ago or somewhere in that neighborhood, he was [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=509.28000000000003s)]
*  on a truck coming south from Idlib. Think of the journey this guy's been on to go from there. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=514.4s)]
*  I don't know, the last time a revolutionary had this level of success in this short amount of time, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=521.76s)]
*  so he's doing something right. But in terms of the sanctions, so people understand how this works. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=526.24s)]
*  When you have legislative sanctions, Congress passed sanctions, what they often do is they [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=531.6s)]
*  require a sanction, but they give the president a waiver. So, the president can essentially say, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=537.1999999999999s)]
*  well, this law is on the books, but I'm waiving this law for 180 days, and that means I won't [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=542.64s)]
*  sanction anything that it kind of flows in during this period of time. I think that is sufficient [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=548.48s)]
*  to get in a lot of immediate needs. And you've had Qatar and other countries, probably Gulf [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=553.12s)]
*  countries like Saudi, willing to kind of put in some money to pay salaries, to start to rebuild [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=558.8s)]
*  things, to just kind of get the place up and running. I think the waiver is certainly sufficient [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=564.64s)]
*  for that to happen. The question though is the kind of investment a business makes requires kind [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=570.4s)]
*  of planning out a few years, right? And a business is probably not going to invest if there's the [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=576.4s)]
*  uncertainty that sanctions carry. I went through this with Iran, to some extent with Cuba, and as [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=582.8s)]
*  long as the sanctions are still on the books, anything that's kind of a multi-year investment [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=590.24s)]
*  is probably chilled. And so, it's a positive step. And again, it'll allow for the kinds of things that [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=594.88s)]
*  will make life better right away and let the Syrian state kind of get up off the ground. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=604.0s)]
*  I would like to see them within the next 180 days try to lift the sanctions, right? So, why not just [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=608.64s)]
*  do the waiver and use that period to do the work on the Hill? Because I don't really know, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=613.68s)]
*  you know, Rubio didn't like say what he's looking for, you know? So, I just think if these guys [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=618.8s)]
*  continue to say and do the right things or enough of the right things, and again, perfect can't be [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=625.76s)]
*  the standard here, it's not going to be perfect. No government's perfect. Ours is certainly not perfect. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=630.0s)]
*  But I'd like to see them just get this off the books. The Caesar Act was passed, again, because [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=634.64s)]
*  Caesar was a photographer who captured horrific human rights violations in Syrian prisons. Like, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=639.76s)]
*  those prisons are closed. Those people are out of prison. Like, the basis with those sanctions is [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=644.48s)]
*  gone. This is a good start, but then let's lift the sanctions and hope that Democrats, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=648.88s)]
*  not because Republicans, you know, not the Democrats listen to us necessarily, but more [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=653.84s)]
*  likely than Republicans, hope Democrats choose to vote for the right thing here and lifting these [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=657.28s)]
*  sanctions. Yeah, I think it's clearly the right thing to do. This is also the first meeting between [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=662.16s)]
*  U.S. president and the Syrian leader in 25 years. Just remarkable, chilling. But to your point, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=666.8000000000001s)]
*  90% of Syrians are currently living in poverty, according to the UN. There's desperate, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=672.48s)]
*  immediate need. Hopefully that will start to address some of it. It's also worth noting that [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=676.8s)]
*  Syria is experiencing a ton of violence right now. There was a car bomb that exploded near a police [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=681.68s)]
*  station in eastern Syria over the weekend that killed three people. The day before, Syrian forces [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=687.1999999999999s)]
*  raided an ISIS hideout in Aleppo, killing several. There's been sectarian violence in a region run by [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=692.24s)]
*  the Druze minority. There's been violence against the Alawites back in March. So there's like a lot [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=698.88s)]
*  of simmering tensions in sectarian minefields that will increase, right? That tension will increase [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=702.88s)]
*  if there's just no economic opportunity and people are starving. That's right. If there's a smaller, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=711.52s)]
*  you know, if there's very little resources, people are more likely to fight over those [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=715.52s)]
*  scarce resources, right? I mean, you have to let activities start to resume. You have to kind of [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=720.08s)]
*  normalize politics and you can't do that in terms of sanctions. That's right. So Ben, as you know, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=725.12s)]
*  me, Love and John share an office. We have Fox News on all day long just because it's just funnier. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=730.72s)]
*  It's much, much meaner to Democrats. But you also just, you can't overstate the degree to which Fox [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=736.0s)]
*  is state-owned media. They take like, we just were watching the Golden Dome announcement. They took [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=741.04s)]
*  it live. He said nothing. It was complete nonsense. Most days include some sort of like gauzy, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=747.52s)]
*  hour-long feature about a cabinet secretary. Here's an example of a part of one from Monday. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=753.28s)]
*  This was Fox News host Will Cain interviewing former Fox News Weekend anchor turned Secretary [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=758.8s)]
*  of Defense Pete Hegsup. This was not planned. This is embarrassing. No, I think it's beautiful. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=764.4s)]
*  It's friendship, Will, all the way to the Pentagon. That was them talking about how crazy it was that [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=770.4s)]
*  they wore the same tie. It's hard sitting on the floor doing stuff. So, but you know, you and I [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=775.52s)]
*  both had some experience with Brett Baer over the years. He's become kind of like the alpha of all [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=781.52s)]
*  the betas. You know, he's like the lead propagandist. He's like that guy in Russian media that we see. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=786.48s)]
*  That talk show host who's always yelling, you know, like a panel of people. Yeah, yeah. And so Brett, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=792.88s)]
*  he is so dedicated to his craft of propaganda that he even followed Trump to the UAE and to Qatar. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=798.0799999999999s)]
*  And he did softball interviews with the leaders there. That, in a roundabout way, will get us to [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=804.3199999999999s)]
*  the latest on the story of Qatar gifting Trump a 747-8. So thanks to the New York Times and CNN, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=809.12s)]
*  we have they did some real reporting on this. They figured out that the backstory for how this [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=816.16s)]
*  plane happened entails Steve Gwitkoff specifically approaching Qatar about getting Trump a new plane. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=820.48s)]
*  And he did so at Trump's request. Apparently, Qatar also gifted the same kind of plane, the 747-8, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=827.28s)]
*  to President Erdogan of Turkey back in 2018, which bought them a bunch of goodwill. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=833.92s)]
*  So maybe it's like a gift bag thing. It was like Derek Jeter back in the day with his dates, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=838.48s)]
*  allegedly. So Ben, here is a clip of the Qatari Prime Minister talking about this plane bribe [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=842.8000000000001s)]
*  fiasco with Brett Baer and then with Bloomberg at the Qatar Economic Forum. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=849.12s)]
*  But I was told that you wanted to address the gift that Qatar is giving to the U.S. government, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=854.96s)]
*  to the Defense Department of this jet. Well, I see that this story is making a [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=860.1600000000001s)]
*  big story in the news. Unfortunately, I see that this story is taking a different direction [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=865.92s)]
*  and it's being more politicized while it's a normal government-to-government deal. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=872.64s)]
*  What was the purpose? What is the purpose? I don't know why people, they are thinking about it, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=877.92s)]
*  about that this is considered as a bribery or considered as something that Qatar wants to [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=884.56s)]
*  buy an influence with this administration. Were you convinced by those rejoinders? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=892.56s)]
*  But the other thing about that, though, if you connect the reporting, if you're Qatar [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=899.52s)]
*  and your literal survival kind of depends on the U.S., I mean, just look at a map, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=904.8s)]
*  it's pretty vulnerable, right? And there's a U.S. airbase there and Steve Wittgoff comes to you [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=909.76s)]
*  and is like, hey, nice plane you got there. Yeah, I like your plane. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=916.0799999999999s)]
*  Think my boss, the president of the United States would like your plane, the same guy that blockaded [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=919.6s)]
*  you the first time around. You'd probably be retrofitting that plane. You know, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=925.0400000000001s)]
*  coffee sucker up in a minute. Although apparently the Qataris have been trying to sell the plane [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=929.76s)]
*  since 2020 because it's just too big. It costs too much to operate. It's like kind of too gaudy. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=934.16s)]
*  And I think according to the Times report, they initially thought that when they flew this plane [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=940.4s)]
*  to Florida for Trump to check it out, that it was in the context of a sale. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=945.76s)]
*  But Wittgoff apparently believed it would be a gift. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=950.48s)]
*  Ah, OK. It's a plot thickens, right? Yeah. Yeah. So it's like, oh, yeah, what's the price of that? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=953.28s)]
*  Well, it's X. That's funny. We had a different price in mind. It's free, you know? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=959.12s)]
*  Right. It really is the vibe of like Joe Pesci closing the door with like, now you can't leave. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=963.6s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, this whole thing is just it's just so obvious. I mean, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=968.24s)]
*  the the the grift is so massive and so in plain sight that there's really nothing you can say [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=974.5600000000001s)]
*  about it. I mean, I will say like the Qataris are pretty savvy people. Like they, you know, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=980.32s)]
*  Al Jazeera runs there. Like, I doubt that they're shocked, shocked that this is a big story in [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=984.88s)]
*  American politics and media. You know, like, of course it is, you know, it's Air Force One. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=989.28s)]
*  I mean, it's the most iconic. It's crazy. Call sign in the world, you know. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=993.76s)]
*  It's so stupid. Yeah. There's also all this reporting that what it would cost to retrofit [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=998.72s)]
*  the plane might would like ultimately cost half a double. Of course it would. Because I mean, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1002.96s)]
*  I, you know, I don't think it's revealing anything, but I mean, just being on Air Force [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1008.32s)]
*  One all those years, like it can do, you know, it can do evasive maneuvers, right? If there's [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1011.76s)]
*  some attack, it can refuel in the air. It must probably need like all kinds of encryption for [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1017.44s)]
*  secure communications. Like there's a reason it takes Boeing like a long time to build a new [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1024.16s)]
*  Air Force One. And so either they're not going to do that kind of retrofitting, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1029.28s)]
*  in which case it won't have all the security that, you know, you would want the US president to have [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1034.6399999999999s)]
*  flying around, or it's going to end up costing kind of roughly the same to the taxpayer anyway. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1039.28s)]
*  So this is just like a pure ego thing. But Wyckoff is so perfect. I mean, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1045.04s)]
*  why is the Middle East peace envoy like negotiating gifts from Gulf Arab governments? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1050.96s)]
*  I think it's because he has a pre-existing relationship with them. They like bailed out [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1056.0800000000002s)]
*  one of those businesses back in the day. So yeah, the whole thing feels gross. And again, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1059.44s)]
*  we know this is now an old story, but like it's such a staggering bit of corruption that it's, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1063.76s)]
*  I think, important to just remember that this is still going to happen. Like I think they're [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1068.16s)]
*  still going to give Trump this plane. He's still going to take it with him to his grave. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1071.52s)]
*  And they'll still, you know, these countries will plow money into Trump coin and they'll still, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1075.28s)]
*  I mean, they'll give money to Trump kids. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1080.1599999999999s)]
*  Oh, you know what I saw today? Eric Trump, apparently this week, is in Vietnam. They're [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1083.28s)]
*  having talks about, I think, opening maybe another Trump tower somewhere in the Capitol. I think [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1088.48s)]
*  there's also, there's reports that Eric may be attending like a groundbreaking ceremony for a [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1094.8s)]
*  Trump golf course while he's in Vietnam. And by the way, this is all happening though, as the [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1101.04s)]
*  Vietnamese government is negotiating, trying to negotiate away their 46% tax. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1105.6s)]
*  Of course. I mean, that's what this is. Like the reason Trump wants to have this dial that he can [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1109.2s)]
*  turn up and down around tariffs and all these things is that each one of these things is a [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1113.04s)]
*  massive profit opportunity, right? So Vietnam has like a sword hanging over its head of like, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1118.16s)]
*  what, 47% tariffs. And it's like, well, in the next 90 days, you could, you know, plow, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1123.6000000000001s)]
*  you know, a ton of money into some Trump golf course and have Eric there and tell him what a [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1130.4s)]
*  business genius he is that you want to have the Trump people running a golf course in a hotel in [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1134.88s)]
*  Vietnam. Of course you're going to do that if you think you weren't really from tariffs. So this is [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1139.0400000000002s)]
*  going to be such a massive wealth transfer to the Trump family for doing fucking nothing. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1142.8000000000002s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry. There's a, the Vietnam just gave the Trump family the green light, a $1.5 billion [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1147.3600000000001s)]
*  golf development project, and they're talking about building a skyscraper in Ho Chi Minh City. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1152.5600000000002s)]
*  So we're double dipping here and Eric's going to come to town. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1157.7600000000002s)]
*  I wouldn't give Eric Trump 20 bucks to go across the street to get a fucking sandwich, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1160.5600000000002s)]
*  you know, if you have a 47 tariff hanging over your head, you give them a billion and a half [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1164.24s)]
*  dollars for a golf course. You do what you got to do. You give them a skyscraper, you give them a [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1169.36s)]
*  747, we move on with our lives. It looks ridiculous. It is bad news. All right, we're going to switch [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1172.08s)]
*  gears a little bit, get some more serious stuff, Ben. This is another big story that I think is a [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1177.84s)]
*  huge deal and it's not getting covered enough. So the context is, as we've discussed, Trump has [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1182.56s)]
*  invoked the Alien Enemies Act to speed up the deportation of Venezuelan migrants. The administration [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1187.84s)]
*  basically wants to set up this parallel immigration process with no due process or [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1192.24s)]
*  checks and balances to just race people out of the country. And the results, as we've all discussed, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1196.72s)]
*  is that about 240 migrants are now rotting in hell in El Salvador. To justify invoking the Alien [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1201.36s)]
*  Enemies Act, Trump had to declare that the Venezuelan government is controlling, turn to [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1207.6s)]
*  Aragua, which we'll call TDA going forward, directing this, the Trump administration is [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1211.68s)]
*  saying the Maduro government is telling TDA to invade the United States, basically. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1217.28s)]
*  Yeah. It's using them as an arm to conduct war against the United States, because that's what [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1221.92s)]
*  the Alien Enemies Act is about. Now, the problem is the intelligence community looked at alleged [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1226.72s)]
*  ties between the Maduro government and TDA and determined that the Maduro government is probably [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1231.76s)]
*  not directing their movements or operations within the United States. This assessment is likely to [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1235.68s)]
*  create some major legal issues for the Trump administration's lawyers as they defend this [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1241.3600000000001s)]
*  policy in court. So you might wonder how did Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1245.2s)]
*  react when her workforce released this assessment that spoke truth to power and had a different [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1250.8s)]
*  assessment than what Trump was stating in his talking points? Well, first, her chief of staff [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1258.6399999999999s)]
*  tried to pressure the analysts into changing their conclusions. They refused. So last week, Gabbard [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1262.48s)]
*  fired the head of the National Intelligence Council and his deputy, and then had the nerve to say that [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1268.8799999999999s)]
*  she did so to, quote, end the weaponization and politicization of the intelligence community. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1274.6399999999999s)]
*  So Ben, the outcome from the cherry picking of intelligence that led us into the Iraq War was [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1279.92s)]
*  obviously far worse and more catastrophic and long lasting than what we're talking about here. But [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1286.24s)]
*  just in terms of the naked politicization of the intelligence community itself, I would actually [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1292.72s)]
*  argue that what Tulsi did here is worse than Dick Cheney just cherry picking things he wanted. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1299.8400000000001s)]
*  They literally went to these guys and said, change your assessment. And when they refused to change [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1305.84s)]
*  their intelligence assessment, they fired them. Yeah. This is a huge story on so many levels. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1310.1599999999999s)]
*  Because first of all, yes, the history of presidents going shopping for the intelligence [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1317.12s)]
*  they want in the United States is not good. That's how you get the Vietnam War. That's how you get [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1321.6s)]
*  the Iraq War bad to do that. The second point is, before we even get to TDA, this is going to send [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1325.6799999999998s)]
*  a message to the entire intelligence community that on whatever issue it is that you're being [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1335.2s)]
*  tasked for analysis on, if you don't provide the information that validates Donald Trump's [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1341.04s)]
*  worldview, you're going to be out of the job. So the message in firing these people isn't just that [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1347.44s)]
*  we want analysts to write a report on TDA that confirms what we say. It's whatever the fucking [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1353.1200000000001s)]
*  topic is. We're not here to give impartial facts. We're not here to understand what's happening in [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1359.2s)]
*  the world. We're not here to avoid mistakes by the US government. We are here to tell Donald [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1363.68s)]
*  Trump whatever he wants to hear. To head on a pike to warn future truth tellers not to do it. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1368.24s)]
*  You might basically hang in front of the fucking intelligence community. And by the way, I see that [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1373.52s)]
*  Tulsa Gabbard is pulling the production of the PDB into the DNI's office. Yes. Not at CIA, but [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1377.92s)]
*  then on the TDA issue itself, this is a huge deal because they have used, we've talked about this [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1383.6000000000001s)]
*  in other contexts, but they continually use national security. I think they studied this in [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1389.92s)]
*  the last few years and they realized that national security authorities are the most powerful [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1393.8400000000001s)]
*  shortcuts to the president having emergency powers. So in this case, the emergency power is [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1398.3200000000002s)]
*  we can basically deport anybody that has a tattoo or whatever. We can just call somebody [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1404.3200000000002s)]
*  Teren de Aragua and we can deport them even if we don't have due process, even if we don't have [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1408.8000000000002s)]
*  evidence. But they're also using national security authorities to put terrorists on people. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1413.2s)]
*  Going forward, if they can draw these kinds of connections, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1418.0s)]
*  they could use those authorities to do basically anything. Far end, extreme end, we can't hold an [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1421.52s)]
*  election because it's a national emergency or we have to invade such country because they're at war [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1429.44s)]
*  with us. You can basically claim whatever powers you want if you're saying we're at war with the [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1433.92s)]
*  foreign government with this proxy fighting us. Can I ask you a quick question? How many national [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1440.24s)]
*  emergencies do you think Trump declared in the first 100 days? That's a good pop quiz. I'm going [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1446.24s)]
*  to guess 50. Eight, which is still more than any other president in this period of time in history, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1453.2s)]
*  but they include things like a national emergency to impose sanctions on the international criminal [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1461.68s)]
*  court. Well, the reason I said 50 is actually I was thinking more outputs and inputs because [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1466.56s)]
*  the national emergency has been used to do far more than eight things. That's how they're [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1471.6s)]
*  deporting all these people. That's how they're terrifying all these countries. Then the last [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1476.8799999999999s)]
*  thing I just want to say about this Tommy is that the idea that the Venezuelan government is directing [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1481.6s)]
*  TDA like some state-sponsored terrorist organization is absolutely fucking insane. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1487.6s)]
*  There's no way that's happening. If you know anything about Venezuela, if you know anything [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1493.28s)]
*  about these gangs, the most you could find is that there are probably some corrupt dudes [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1496.96s)]
*  somewhere in the Maduro government who are on the take from TDA and they do business with them, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1502.0s)]
*  which is nothing like Iran directing Hezbollah or something. What they're trying to portray is [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1508.24s)]
*  happening is just not happening. They can't find anybody to say it's happening, but they're going [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1515.44s)]
*  to keep looking until they find someone who will just make shit up for them. It's completely absurd. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1520.24s)]
*  As we discussed, the result is they are sending human beings to this gulag in El Salvador. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1524.6399999999999s)]
*  The Cato Institute did a recent review of all these men who had been sent down and they found [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1531.12s)]
*  that 50 of the guys now in Sokot in this prison in El Salvador came to the US legally and never [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1535.76s)]
*  violated any immigration law. This rushed, half-assed, fucked up process is just sending [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1541.84s)]
*  innocent people to rot. This is what's so grotesque about the whole immigration approach you're taking [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1546.8s)]
*  too is that most of these Venezuelans had temporary protected status in this country. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1550.88s)]
*  Haitians had temporary protected status in the country. That means that they were here legally. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1555.8400000000001s)]
*  When you say they didn't commit crimes, what you offer your back is, well, it was a crime to come [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1561.2800000000002s)]
*  here. Well, it wasn't because they were granted legal status. This is really fascist stuff. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1565.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it really is. Before we move on to fascist stuff, we wanted to highlight the escalating [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1572.24s)]
*  attacks in El Salvador itself against the press and human rights organizations by [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1576.8799999999999s)]
*  Naya Bukele's government. Over the weekend, The Washington Post wrote about this trio of [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1581.9199999999998s)]
*  investigative journalists from an independent outlet called El Faro, which is Spanish for [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1585.76s)]
*  Lighthouse, who joined four other colleagues who'd previously fled the country after reporting on [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1590.32s)]
*  these alleged deals between Bukele and the country's gangs. Then on Sunday, authorities arrested Ruth [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1595.52s)]
*  Lopez, a lawyer at the human rights organization, Cristosal, who was publicly accused of Bukele [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1601.04s)]
*  government of corruption. Ruth's colleague Noah Bullock, who's been on the show before, sent us [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1606.08s)]
*  a voice memo just offering some more context about this wave of repression. Here's a clip. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1611.36s)]
*  My colleague Ruth, she's the head of our anti-corruption unit. She's led a team that's [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1617.04s)]
*  investigated over 15 cases of corruption during the Bukele regime. She's a person who's super [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1621.6799999999998s)]
*  credible in the country and really what loved. She's one of the most visible and consistently [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1630.08s)]
*  critical voices. So the big takeaway from this is that the Bukele regime is no longer [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1637.52s)]
*  worried about appearances. And a lot of that, I think, has to do with this being probably the [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1644.4s)]
*  worst three months of his whole two presidential administrations. His popularity has dropped from [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1649.6s)]
*  above 80% down to 50. When you have people expressing dissent and you lose control of the [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1658.24s)]
*  narrative, then the regime begins to act and use the repressive power that it has. Just in the last [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1664.9599999999998s)]
*  week, there were about 20 different people who were detained illegally, clearly political motives [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1671.28s)]
*  behind it. Three journalists who did an interview with gang members talking about their partnership [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1681.52s)]
*  with them, had to flee the country. One of those 20 people who were detained already died in custody [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1688.48s)]
*  of the state as a lack of access to medicine. On top of that, Bukele announced a Russian-style [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1696.0s)]
*  foreign agents law that would put a tax on NGOs Sunday night with the capture of Ruth. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1704.16s)]
*  What's really surprising is that in attacking her, they're not going after the weakest. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1711.76s)]
*  She's one of the best connected, most credible voices in the country and internationally. And [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1718.24s)]
*  so they're trying to silence a powerful voice. So that's who the US government's in bed with, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1723.8400000000001s)]
*  Ben. Marco Rubio's flying down to hang out with Bukele. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1728.4s)]
*  Calling him such a great friend. Yeah, Trump's welcoming into the Oval Office. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1732.8s)]
*  This is the government we are now closest with in the region. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1737.2s)]
*  Yeah. These are the people Trump likes, is the strongman around the world. The one thing that [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1740.96s)]
*  I think is interesting, more than one thing in that clip, the fact that Bukele's popularity is [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1745.76s)]
*  dropping. I don't think countries like El Salvador want to be some subsidiary of the Trump organization. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1751.12s)]
*  So let's go at the world's quote unquote coolest dictator this way. This guy's such a tough guy [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1758.6399999999999s)]
*  that he's basically a bag man for Donald Trump. That's not strength. He doesn't look like a strong [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1764.1599999999999s)]
*  man sitting there kissing Donald Trump's ass and taking direction from Stephen Miller. I [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1768.8799999999999s)]
*  shouldn't say this in case I end up ... But seriously, this is just a sign of we'll get [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1774.96s)]
*  to the elections later in the thing. But Trump is not exactly a brand you want to associate with. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1783.92s)]
*  You can do it in the Gulf because there's no opposition there. But I think people are going [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1789.92s)]
*  to find in other parts of the world that hitching your wagon to this is not the best move. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1794.72s)]
*  Yeah. Look, there's no doubt that Bukele took some really drastic unconstitutional steps to [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1798.72s)]
*  address an acute need, which was a murder rate that was shockingly high. I think it went from 51 [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1804.72s)]
*  murders per 100,000 people in 2019 to 1.9 people per 100,000 in 2024. So you can't overstate [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1810.32s)]
*  how important that increase in security and safety is for people on the ground. But the poverty rate [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1818.0s)]
*  in El Salvador went from 26.8% in 2019 to 30% in 2023. So people can't find work, they can't find [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1824.48s)]
*  food. You can't just continually arrest people until poverty is solved. That's just not how it [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1832.56s)]
*  works. I mean, he'll try that. But I mean, because people want security, but then they want security [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1838.16s)]
*  to be a pathway towards a more prosperous society and more return of freedoms. And so he's following [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1842.0800000000002s)]
*  the same pattern. All these people are like, wow, look, this hard right-wing crackdown politics is [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1850.0s)]
*  successful. Well, the first couple of years it is. But then once it's a repressive police state that [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=1855.6000000000001s)]

*  All right Ben we're going to switch gears here and talk about the situation on the ground in [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2038.72s)]
*  Gaza. So you're obviously going to hear a lot more about the humanitarian situation [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2042.48s)]
*  for ordinary people in Ben's interview but there's some big political developments we want to cover [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2046.0800000000002s)]
*  too. The biggest news is that Israel's launched a massive new offensive into Gaza on Monday in [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2050.48s)]
*  Netanyahu said that Israel is quote moving toward full control of Gaza. As of this recording the [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2056.32s)]
*  New York Times says that Israel had not yet begun this long-awaited military advance which would [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2061.6800000000003s)]
*  involve thousands of ground troops but the IDF has ordered the evacuation of Gaza's second largest [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2067.28s)]
*  city, Khan Yunis, which is in line with their plan to displace people into a humanitarian zone and [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2072.56s)]
*  then begin this invasion. The international response to this ground offensive has been [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2078.4s)]
*  swift and harsh. The UK, France, and Canada released a joint statement which reads in part [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2084.32s)]
*  we strongly oppose the expansion of Israel's military operations in Gaza. The level of human [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2089.6000000000004s)]
*  suffering in Gaza is intolerable. They also said quote Israel must halt settlements which are [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2093.92s)]
*  illegal. We will not hesitate to take further action including targeted sanctions so really [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2098.56s)]
*  like you know expanding the things they're criticizing and including threats. David Lammy, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2102.96s)]
*  a friend of the pod UK foreign secretary, announced the suspension of trade talks between the UK and [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2107.84s)]
*  Israel. Here is a bit of his speech to parliament where he talks about all this. The government has [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2112.48s)]
*  always backed Israel's right to defend itself. We have condemned Hamas and its abhorrent treatment [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2116.88s)]
*  of the hostages and we have stood with families and demanded their loved ones be released. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2123.52s)]
*  It's morally unjustifiable. It's wholly disproportionate. It's utterly utterly [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2130.16s)]
*  counterproductive. Whatever Israeli ministers claim this is not the way to bring the hostages [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2137.6s)]
*  safely home. Good for Lammy there. There's been a lot of pressure from the left in the UK for the [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2145.04s)]
*  Labour Party to step up and do and say more so good to hear him do that. So Ben like we just we [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2151.36s)]
*  talked about this war for so long that you've you kind of run out of words for how terrible things [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2156.24s)]
*  are like just to lay out a couple facts as we've as we speak the Israeli government has had a near [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2160.48s)]
*  total blockade of Gaza for about 11 weeks. A top UN official named Tom Fletcher said that 14,000 babies [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2165.28s)]
*  in Gaza could die in the next 48 hours if aid doesn't get in. Airstrikes have drastically ramped [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2171.92s)]
*  up in advance of this new ground offensive. There are sites like Dropsite News have done a great job [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2177.44s)]
*  of recirculating clips from Palestinian journalists of the aftermath of these airstrikes and it's [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2184.4s)]
*  as bad as anything you've ever seen. People are being displaced for the third, fourth, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2189.76s)]
*  fifteenth time and let's just be honest like as Lammy said there Ben Israeli hostages are far more [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2193.84s)]
*  likely to die as a result of this operation and the starvation of people in Gaza than to be saved [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2199.76s)]
*  by some military campaign. So it's just there is no military rationale for this war. There's no [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2206.32s)]
*  moral justification for it. This is Netanyahu continuing the slaughter of human beings in Gaza [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2211.92s)]
*  for political reasons so he can appease his kind of right wing base and government and meanwhile [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2218.4s)]
*  like frenemy Donald Trump is working on an ethnic cleansing plan that would send a million Palestinians [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2224.08s)]
*  to live in exile in Libya. Yeah I um there's no military rationale for this right. Hamas is not [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2229.6800000000003s)]
*  like fighting there's there's absolutely no threat that is being addressed by this military [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2240.56s)]
*  operation right. I mean there are this is a population that lives in a place that has been [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2247.68s)]
*  entirely destroyed right like the almost every structure destroyed or damaged. You've had you [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2254.96s)]
*  know we I talked about in the interview but like the death toll is much higher than you know they [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2261.12s)]
*  can report anymore. It's probably like somewhere over 100,000 people. They've not let any food into [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2266.0s)]
*  the Gaza Strip. Now they're made let a dribble in right. They're just killing these people [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2272.56s)]
*  and they're mainly almost entirely killing civilians at this point you know. And so I [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2281.12s)]
*  I have to say Tommy like I talked to Feroz and he said everybody in Gaza expects to die right. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2286.96s)]
*  That's a genocide okay and and people don't like to hear that term but I don't really know [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2294.32s)]
*  what other what the military rationale is to starve children and bomb innocent people in tents [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2300.48s)]
*  and just kind of keep moving this war around and and and keep talking about ethnic cleansing [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2309.6800000000003s)]
*  people to other places. Like well I'm out of words to describe what is happening you know. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2314.08s)]
*  And we I think the reason you see some of these governments saying these things is because they [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2319.6800000000003s)]
*  know what's happening and you know they're they're creating a bit of a record you know that they were [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2325.68s)]
*  calling this out because I just don't know what to say about this anymore you know. I mean I [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2331.12s)]
*  I didn't mean I just don't know what else to say. Listen I'm with you. I like I bet listeners to the [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2336.96s)]
*  show have probably not. We've you've heard us talk to really smart human rights lawyers about the [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2341.44s)]
*  genocide filing in the case by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. The elements that [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2347.3599999999997s)]
*  go into a determination of genocide but like I have not thrown around the term because I think [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2353.44s)]
*  it's the worst thing you could ever accuse someone of and you want that you want to do so in a way [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2359.2000000000003s)]
*  that's based in fact and the letter of the law and also used to be mindful of the history of the whole [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2365.2000000000003s)]
*  cross-reference. Yeah no I'm mindful because I have it in my family. No no I know I know and so but just so [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2371.52s)]
*  no folks know but like in the in the like in the present convention of human rights genocide means [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2375.92s)]
*  any of the following acts committed with the intent to destroy in whole or in part a national [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2382.8s)]
*  ethnic racial or religious group that involves killing members of the group causing bodily harm [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2386.88s)]
*  and mental illness to members of the group preventing births or forcibly transferring children [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2390.96s)]
*  but to constitute genocide there must be proven intent on the part of the perpetrators to physically [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2395.28s)]
*  destroy a national ethnical racial or religious group. I think what you just said is the key point [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2400.0s)]
*  when you start talking about starving an entire population what else is that? I'd like I mean [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2405.6s)]
*  honestly at this point the because again I'm not a human rights lawyer right and so I'm not making [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2414.64s)]
*  some like legal determination here the question I have is what are they doing because they're not [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2419.68s)]
*  rescuing hostages these are not like hostage hostage rescue operations you know they're not [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2425.04s)]
*  I mean they've killed the leadership of Hamas like I don't like there should actually be an [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2432.0s)]
*  onus on Netanyahu and these Israeli ministers to describe what why are you starving people [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2436.96s)]
*  why is there no aid getting in what why why are you doing ground operations for the umpteenth time [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2445.12s)]
*  in in these what is the purpose of this because nobody can describe a military purpose anymore [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2451.28s)]
*  and sure they say it's because they have to release the hostage that is not what is happening here [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2457.04s)]
*  this is not about hostages because you would get the hostages out by doing a deal right that's [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2462.3199999999997s)]
*  been well established even Trump says that right so I just like this is just me saying like I don't [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2468.3999999999996s)]
*  know what else is going on here like I don't the Israeli government cannot provide like a military [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2474.3999999999996s)]
*  rationale for for starving children bombing civilians and doing ground operations in Gaza [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2480.7999999999997s)]
*  a year and a half after October 7th and when you when you read the words of like top Israeli [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2488.08s)]
*  officials like cabinet ministers like the finance minister minister Smotrich he said that Israel's [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2494.24s)]
*  goal is quote destroying everything that's left of the Gaza Strip we are conquering cleansing [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2498.88s)]
*  and remaining in Gaza until Hamas is destroyed what is that I mean what is that how does that [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2504.32s)]
*  overlap with the definition you read yeah pretty pretty one I mean well there's an entire other [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2510.24s)]
*  definition which is just ethnic cleansing yeah well that's and that's actually you know that [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2514.48s)]
*  that's very clear yeah that there's a version of that happening it's um it's it's horrifying [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2518.64s)]
*  and again like Israel allowed five trucks into Gaza on Monday on Tuesday I think they let in [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2524.48s)]
*  93 trucks I think the human rights at this point people are so they're starving so much that they [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2531.36s)]
*  need like 500 a day yeah and despite a couple trucks getting in or 93 plus five trucks getting [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2538.56s)]
*  in no aid has been distributed according to the UN what is going to happen to these kids [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2544.08s)]
*  like babies babies children I mean JD Vance apparently was considering visiting Gaza this [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2550.4s)]
*  week he decided against it Axios reported that was because he didn't want to be seen as endorsing [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2555.68s)]
*  this latest offensive if you're offended if JD Vance is offended yeah he claimed it was [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2560.4s)]
*  logistics that is bullshit yeah you know nothing better to do you're a fucking vice president [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2564.08s)]
*  and that's my suspicion about these statements and that is that people we can't see what's going on [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2567.7599999999998s)]
*  inside but some of these governments you know they have intelligence agencies I think people [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2573.28s)]
*  are aware that what is happening now is like next level even from what we've seen you know [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2577.6800000000003s)]
*  and that's why we're I mean that's why we're having an uncomfortable conversation about it [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2583.1200000000003s)]
*  right now yeah I mean like there were obvious reasons where like the weeks after October 7th [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2587.1200000000003s)]
*  that Israel would launch some sort of military and intelligence operation we're a year and a half [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2592.48s)]
*  into this thing like the leaders of Hamas are dead more than that actually we're you know over [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2596.88s)]
*  yeah the only hot the way the only way we're getting hostages home alive is through a deal [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2601.12s)]
*  yeah and Netanyahu just won't cut one because it doesn't serve his political ends yeah is what it [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2605.84s)]
*  is also the other major conflict then is the war in Ukraine last week we previewed these Trump [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2609.6800000000003s)]
*  endorsed talks between Ukraine and Russia in Turkey it was their first direct talk since the [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2617.2000000000003s)]
*  invasion started Trump was in the Middle East he was pushing for the talks to happen he at first [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2621.76s)]
*  suggested he might join the talks himself and then of course he didn't show up Putin didn't show [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2626.32s)]
*  up and then Trump defended Putin for not showing up which is just perfect the talks accomplished [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2631.04s)]
*  very little they agreed to exchange a thousand prisoners that was the largest prisoner swap yet [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2636.96s)]
*  but Reuters headlines summed it up well Istanbul peace talks lay bare chasm between Ukraine and [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2642.0800000000004s)]
*  Russia then on Monday Trump talked with Zelensky on the phone then he called Putin for two hours [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2647.1200000000003s)]
*  and then he had a conference call with Zelensky and leaders from Germany France Italy Finland and [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2652.24s)]
*  the European Commission to kind of like sync up on what had been said in short this call [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2656.48s)]
*  accomplished absolutely nothing it was like talks about starting talks Trump got no concessions from [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2660.16s)]
*  Putin doesn't sound like he pressured him in any way my takeaway then is that Trump is sick of [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2664.56s)]
*  this process he wants out of it and he wants to push it onto the Vatican am I is that too cynical [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2669.92s)]
*  am I missing anything it seems like you know he's sick of it and he realizes that his plan [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2675.68s)]
*  you know is going nowhere because his plan was essentially to come in and pressure Ukraine and [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2683.12s)]
*  the war and the Ukrainians agreed to everything Trump pressured them to do and then Putin just [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2687.2799999999997s)]
*  ignored Trump and Putin like clearly doesn't feel any pressure from Trump I mean that's what's [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2692.56s)]
*  what's amazing I mean it is you know I'm not like putting on like you know uh [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2698.3999999999996s)]
*  wants a tin resistance hat here but but I mean Trump like loses his shit kind of Mueller time [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2703.92s)]
*  darling well no but the thing is is like Trump loses his shit when anybody disrespects him Putin [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2709.36s)]
*  is totally disrespecting him and he won't even say a bad word about him you know he won't even [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2714.64s)]
*  like say that it's his fault he won't even say the things about Putin that he says about Zelensky [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2718.64s)]
*  you know and and if Putin doesn't feel like the cost to him doing that is some big new package of [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2723.04s)]
*  military assistance to Ukraine or something something that would be material or bad for Russia [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2730.8s)]
*  Putin has no incentive to stop what he's doing which is really escalating the war we've seen [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2735.04s)]
*  like ways of drone attacks we've seen like grinding on the front line here and and it does [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2739.76s)]
*  feel like Trump's rather than pivoting to pressuring you know Putin he's probably going to look to just [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2744.7200000000003s)]
*  offload this back to the Europeans and and then the question is if that happens does he cut the [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2750.7200000000003s)]
*  Ukrainians off anyway you know and and that's a we don't know the answer I think what Ukraine's [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2756.1600000000003s)]
*  been trying to do is go to the extra mile to appear reasonable right Zelensky goes to Turkey [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2760.48s)]
*  exactly Putin doesn't show up Zelensky agrees to a 38 ceasefire Putin doesn't and I think what [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2764.4s)]
*  Zelensky and the Europeans are hoping is that if it's so clear that Russia is the reason why [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2768.88s)]
*  this Trump you know peace effort failed that they'll continue to provide weapons and intelligence to [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2772.88s)]
*  Ukrainians we don't know the answer to that yeah I think there's like three billion dollars that's [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2778.16s)]
*  ready worth of military assistance that's ready to go and Trump just won't send it I do think [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2782.32s)]
*  the intelligence piece is probably the biggest thing it's under discussed and if Trump cuts off [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2786.96s)]
*  intelligence cooperation fully with the Ukrainians that will be devastating for them then it also [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2792.6400000000003s)]
*  seems like Putin is floating to wit cough and then to Trump some kind of vague opportunity for [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2797.92s)]
*  increased trade between the US and Russia but before the Russian invasion in 2022 the full-scale [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2803.12s)]
*  Russian invasion US exports to Russia accounted for 0.3 percent of total US exports imports were [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2808.2400000000002s)]
*  about 1.1 percent of total US imports so like the big countries we're talking a big dollar [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2814.72s)]
*  number like 36 billion dollars in 2021 but it's not it's like not enough to juice the US economy [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2820.3199999999997s)]
*  yeah you know right yeah yeah yeah Putin is just clearly stringing Trump along I mean [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2826.64s)]
*  Dmitry Peskov his spokesman said that there cannot be any deadlines for these kind of like [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2830.24s)]
*  memorandums they're going to put together about restarting talks because the devil is in the [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2836.7999999999997s)]
*  details so they're just giving themselves like a string it out forever plan I'm with you I think [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2840.64s)]
*  I guess all I wonder is I hope the Europeans have come to grips with the fact that Trump is walking [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2846.96s)]
*  away from Ukraine and they are doing what they can to prepare in the little bit of time they're [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2852.7999999999997s)]
*  getting here from this stupid process yeah but like the part of the problem here is that nobody [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2856.72s)]
*  really knows because Trump like they don't like you've got Trump he's got some play he's running [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2865.28s)]
*  you've got JD Vance who you know in the JD Vance version of history I mean this all happened because [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2873.1200000000003s)]
*  you know NATO membership was dangled for Ukraine well you know what we've now removed that and [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2881.2000000000003s)]
*  Putin is still fighting the war you know so that turns out to not be correct right and then Marco [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2887.28s)]
*  Rubio is out to lunch Steve Witkoff is just flattered he gets to be in the room with Putin [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2893.04s)]
*  got a painting and we got a painting painting and but the point is that nobody knows every just kind [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2896.96s)]
*  of guessing like what is Trump actually doing here like what when this if this fails like [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2902.08s)]
*  nobody knows what his plan b is doesn't feel like there's a lot of consultation going on with the [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2907.6s)]
*  Europeans about you know if x happens then y will happen and that's what's so strange about this is [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2911.36s)]
*  it's like it hasn't been like a methodical effort to develop a peace strategy it's basically been [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2917.92s)]
*  like you know chasing like Putin is Lucy with the football and and like Lucy pulls back the football [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2923.84s)]
*  and then Trump goes and kicks Zelensky in the balls you know like that's what all we've seen and [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2929.92s)]
*  and so we it's hard to see where it's going if again if what ends up happening is we end up cutting [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2934.88s)]
*  off Ukraine without a peace deal then Putin is rewarded for sticking it to Trump and [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2941.44s)]
*  Zelensky is punished for agreeing to all the terms that Trump demanded that he agreed to he I mean [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2947.84s)]
*  didn't agree to all of them but he agreed to the ceasefire ones so and the minerals deal stuff this [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2952.7200000000003s)]
*  is not the art of the deal I mean not to use a no this is just a mess it's a failed negotiation [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2956.88s)]
*  he said he would end the war in 24 hours obviously that hasn't happened he seems fed up all his [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2961.44s)]
*  cabinet members are whining about it because they had to do their jobs for 100 days because it's not [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2966.88s)]
*  as simple as it is JD Vance hit on the all-in pod would make it seem yes that's exactly right and [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2970.72s)]
*  meanwhile all of Europe is terrified speaking of Europe and this past weekend Europe had three [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2975.9199999999996s)]
*  elections we wanted to highlight so their elections in Romania Poland and Portugal start [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2981.04s)]
*  with Portugal on Sunday Portugal center-right democratic alliance which is led by prime minister [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2985.2799999999997s)]
*  Luis Montenegro they won a snap election it was the third election in three years which sounds [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2990.3199999999997s)]
*  really annoying yeah it'll allow the ruling party the government to continue as a minority [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=2995.8399999999997s)]
*  government but the biggest and most worrying story coming out of the results was the rise [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3000.16s)]
*  of the country's far-right Chaga party which means enough in Portuguese this party was founded only [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3005.44s)]
*  six years ago Chaga got 22 percent of the vote they might surpass the second place finishing [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3010.64s)]
*  socialist party for the number of parliamentary seats and again just for context Chaga went from [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3016.24s)]
*  having one lawmaker in 2019 to probably about 58 now the last time a far-right party held this [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3020.3199999999997s)]
*  much sway in Portugal it was a nationalist dictatorship yeah not good a little fascism [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3026.64s)]
*  back there yeah so in Poland Rafal Trzykowski who is aligned with the prime minister Donald Tusk [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3032.48s)]
*  narrowly won the first round of an election where the second third and fourth place were [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3038.64s)]
*  each taken by the far right there's going to be a runoff in Poland on June 1st so that's another [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3042.56s)]
*  very important election to watch and then in Romania the Bucharest mayor Nikasar Don took [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3046.3199999999997s)]
*  almost 54 percent of the vote which was surprising he beat a Christian nationalist named George Simeon [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3050.96s)]
*  who had won the first round it has been as we've discussed on the show a crazy six months [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3056.08s)]
*  remaining politics so like last year there was this a different far-right pro-russian candidate [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3061.6s)]
*  named Killeen Georgevcu he won the first round of their election back in November 2024 the results [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3067.84s)]
*  were annulled because of concerns about Russian interference Georgevcu was banned from running [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3073.84s)]
*  again by Romania's constitutional courts which led to the second election so Ben just like [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3078.88s)]
*  stepping back there's a couple trends here that seem interesting to me I would love to know what [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3084.72s)]
*  your thoughts are out of all this one across Europe you're just seeing like this unsettlingly [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3088.24s)]
*  large chunk of the electorate voting for far-right populist parties it's like 20 to 40 percent of the [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3094.16s)]
*  vote in a lot of places including scary parties like the AFD in Germany but also Cega too you're [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3099.4399999999996s)]
*  seeing incumbents just getting smoked in a lot of places voters are very open to new parties [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3106.72s)]
*  including parties that were literally created just a few years ago the thing that was interesting [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3112.32s)]
*  about Romania though it was sort of hopeful to me that the new party doesn't have to be nationalist [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3117.1200000000003s)]
*  yeah institution like Don is pro-nato he's pro-eu but I don't know what did you take away from [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3124.4s)]
*  I don't know these these three elections I mean it's an interesting picture into the kind of [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3130.2400000000002s)]
*  fluidity of politics in Europe right now in the sense that okay you have these very worrying [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3134.7200000000003s)]
*  signs about the rapid evolution and growth of the far right as we see in Portugal but on the other [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3141.44s)]
*  hand like I didn't see that outcome in Romania kind of like I thought the far right guy was going to [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3148.96s)]
*  win in Romania and and and that makes you again question is there some reconsideration of a full [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3152.7200000000003s)]
*  move to the far right kind of post-Trump election post kind of seeing you know there's something [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3160.32s)]
*  sobering about getting right up to the edge and looking over I mean because what we've seen in [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3165.52s)]
*  their edging yeah well but what I've seen what I have seen in Europe we've seen we saw in France [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3170.0s)]
*  right like most notably people kind of these far right parties grow and grow and grow and they [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3176.8799999999997s)]
*  kind of get right to the edge of taking power and people kind of look over that cliff and they're [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3182.7999999999997s)]
*  like well maybe let's just dial back a little bit right yeah it's like I want to protest vote for [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3187.9199999999996s)]
*  them but I don't really want them to run I don't really want them to run stuff you know now Poland [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3191.3599999999997s)]
*  will be interesting because you know we we had the center-left coalition win this is and that's [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3194.3999999999996s)]
*  already the the parliamentary majority the question is do you ever get a president aligned with that [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3198.96s)]
*  so the Polish runoff will be really important to watch because if if the center-left can win [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3203.52s)]
*  which will be hard because if you add up all the numbers of the different parties like you know they [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3207.36s)]
*  they're not winning right now but then that would kind of consolidate a positive trend in Poland but [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3212.48s)]
*  the point is it's it's fluid it's push and pull the far right can't quite make it over that hump [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3217.28s)]
*  in most places and and you got to hope that they're receding a bit and the Romanian election might [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3222.32s)]
*  indicate that because people are like yeah you know what maybe this isn't the right protest vote [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3227.28s)]
*  to your point I mean like traditional social democratic parties are not doing great there [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3232.32s)]
*  may be an opening for like some enough parties on the left like not a bad name by the way yeah [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3237.1200000000003s)]
*  enough like I'd vote for the non-far-right version of enough in this country at this point you know [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3241.44s)]
*  yeah yeah what's like uh how do you say fuck off in Romania fuck off elites yeah you're the [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3247.1200000000003s)]
*  describing the politics as fluid I think is spot on and kind of at times even internally incoherent [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3253.04s)]
*  like yeah you have a pro-nato pro-eu uh a candidate winning in Romania but there was a February 2024 [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3258.48s)]
*  survey that found that less than 20 percent of you of Romanians think they should continue providing [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3266.0s)]
*  support for Ukraine so it's like hardly like a global spring these are not resounding uh [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3270.56s)]
*  endorsements either way though the far right is getting traction but they're not getting like some [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3276.32s)]
*  resounding norseman either like people are just they're not happy with their political choices is [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3279.92s)]
*  what's interesting yeah I mean the big issue in Romania it's it remains one of the poorest [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3284.0s)]
*  countries in the EU if you look at uh GDP per capita uh actually Poland is pretty far down there [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3288.16s)]
*  too I mean the number one the highest uh do you know what the number one rated country is but in [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3294.0s)]
*  terms of uh per capita GDP in the EU I'm quizzing you I'm gonna say it's Lichtenstein or Luxembourg [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3298.64s)]
*  Luxembourg you nailed it and Ireland I knew it was when I was little guys Ireland yeah good for [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3304.48s)]
*  you Ireland sure they have all that uh tax revenue from all our yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3308.96s)]
*  tech companies yeah probably drives at the GDP yeah but like the the Romanian population from [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3312.88s)]
*  1990 to 2024 Romania's population declined by about four million people because there were just no [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3318.16s)]
*  job opportunities and the labor market stagnated so it was a tough life the last thing I saw that [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3323.92s)]
*  was interesting do you see that have you been to Romania I've not been no no no I'd like to get [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3328.2400000000002s)]

*  that the French government came to him and asked him to silence conservative voices in Romania [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3338.56s)]
*  the French government denies that but I thought that was interesting given the context did he say [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3344.08s)]
*  that from his prison cell in France or maybe I bet he escaped before we should check up on that guy [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3348.0s)]
*  yeah I didn't know what happened then yeah I don't remember either they arrested him did they let him [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3352.64s)]

*  be here. All right so I want to get to asking you to kind of compare the two times you've been in [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3630.8s)]
*  Gaza but let's just start at the beginning how does a trauma surgeon from California end up in [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3638.2400000000002s)]
*  European hospital in Kanyunas? Yeah yeah so the first time the so the the the humanitarian sphere [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3643.2000000000003s)]
*  is like completely disjointed totally disorganized as you can imagine and but so I got a I got an [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3652.4s)]
*  email from the Society of Critical Care Medicine which is just a professional society that I'm [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3660.0s)]
*  part of and say uh uh letting people know that if you want to volunteer in Israel after the October [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3664.24s)]
*  7th attacks this is how you can do it and if you want to volunteer in uh Gaza this is how you can [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3671.12s)]
*  do it and um uh that that call for volunteers the the call for volunteers was to work with the WHO [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3675.84s)]
*  in Gaza uh because you can't really work with the Ministry of Health directly because you'll be [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3682.72s)]
*  considered you know because yeah exactly you'll be considered working with a terrorist organization [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3687.2s)]
*  so um so that and that call went out through the Palestinian American Medical Association so I [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3691.52s)]
*  contacted them um and they uh they sent us over and uh at that time we went to Cairo we could take a [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3696.56s)]
*  whole bunch of supplies with us and stuff because the Rafah gate was still open but now obviously not. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3702.3999999999996s)]
*  So obviously we want to focus on your experience there um and I guess it is worth contrasting here [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3706.96s)]
*  so how would you compare the two different times you you spent there I assume that you know just [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3715.12s)]
*  as someone who's following this that what what was already not a significant amount of health care [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3723.52s)]
*  infrastructure um has basically been destroyed yeah um but but what what did you see differently [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3728.96s)]
*  the the last time you were there from the first time? Yeah so the first time I went I was at [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3736.16s)]
*  European on the eastern edge of Khan Younis and at that time European hospital like most of the [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3740.56s)]
*  hospitals in Gaza was a displaced persons camp so there were 10 to 15 000 people sheltering on the [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3745.52s)]
*  grounds of the hospital but then also within the hospital like lining the corridors of the hospital [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3750.88s)]
*  there were families living in tents um because it's better to live inside than outside have some [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3755.44s)]
*  electricity something like that um so like women were cooking pita bread in the emergency room [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3759.92s)]
*  during mass casualty events uh women you know there were there were people trying to drain out uh you [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3765.04s)]
*  know canned vegetables in the ICU sink like it was a total disaster there was no way for a hospital [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3769.6s)]
*  to function this way and um so that is that is the fact that that wasn't going on when I went back [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3773.36s)]
*  this time I went for I got I entered Gaza this time on March 6th and I left on April 1st if I [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3780.64s)]
*  remember right and um so when I went back uh every hospital in Gaza has been forcibly uh [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3785.7599999999998s)]
*  emptied at some point and uh when it's when people have been allowed to come back in the [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3792.4s)]
*  administration and the ministry of health have kind of decided together that we're not going to [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3796.88s)]
*  let Palestinians camp in the hospital anymore just it's not you know they don't have anywhere to go [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3800.2400000000002s)]
*  but at the same time there's just no way for them to um the the hospital can't function like that [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3805.52s)]
*  even though it's sheltering people it's not being a hospital at that point so Nasser I went back to [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3811.6800000000003s)]
*  Nasser Medical Complex which is on the other side of Khan Younis and um the only the thing that was [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3816.1600000000003s)]
*  better was that Khan Younis or that that Nasser was not a DP camp so the hospital could actually [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3822.08s)]
*  function uh but everything else was worse um I arrived during the ceasefire you know March 6th [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3826.32s)]
*  to April 18th was still ceasefire time and uh we were seeing trauma cases for sure like one or two [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3831.6s)]
*  people shot every day uh sometimes it was from Israel some Israeli forces sometimes it was [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3836.96s)]
*  actually because there was a dispute going on between two families in uh in Khan Younis and [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3842.24s)]
*  the Hamas government couldn't suppress it like they normally would um but the uh uh but the other [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3846.8s)]
*  types of trauma cases we were seeing were uh people who were there was no widespread bombing [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3854.16s)]
*  going on at this point so the the other type of trauma we would see was from bombings that had [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3858.88s)]
*  happened like six months ago and people's homes would collapse on them when they tried to go back [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3863.52s)]
*  in the main thing was actually to retrieve their loved ones bodies but also like to try and get [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3867.84s)]
*  their possessions out uh you know if they had cash that had been in the building when it had [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3871.44s)]
*  been destroyed things like that um and uh and yeah so but the uh but unfortunately the you know [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3875.76s)]
*  the destruction of Gaza was far far more severe well when I was there the first time the battle [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3882.96s)]
*  of Khan Younis was still going on like Israeli troops were basically moving from north to south [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3887.76s)]
*  um and uh the hospital was constantly shaking even though uh European hospital is on the outskirts [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3891.6800000000003s)]
*  of Khan Younis um the the hospital was just literally swaying back and forth almost the [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3897.28s)]
*  entire time there were windows broken on the third floor um one of the guys I went there with Mark [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3901.92s)]
*  Perlmutter he was thrown into a wall by an explosion broke one of his teeth um you know so [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3906.96s)]
*  it was it was the it was close up when I got back to Nasser or when I went when I went to Nasser from [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3910.96s)]
*  the second to the 18th there was no bombing at all um so it was you know they were shooting but not [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3917.04s)]
*  not bombing so it was relatively quiet but then after the 18th when you know at 2 30 in the morning [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3922.0s)]
*  about the uh the Israelis resumed the really widespread bombing of of Gaza mostly to kill [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3927.04s)]
*  Hamas's political leadership they said and it was that that was the biggest that was the start of [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3931.84s)]
*  the biggest mass casualty event I've ever seen in my life like I was a resident during the Boston [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3938.16s)]
*  Marathon bombing and it doesn't even it that was like an order of magnitude off of what we saw [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3941.52s)]
*  on the 18th and then not just the 18th but going forward and who like what kind of who how many [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3947.52s)]
*  people that you're treating are children are civilians I mean I mean how take us inside like [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3953.92s)]
*  the kind of um the pace and the kind of patients you're seeing yeah and the kind of injuries you're [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3960.96s)]
*  seeing yeah well so yeah so at uh at Nasser when I went this time everything was uh after March 18th [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3966.7200000000003s)]
*  everything was explosions uh there were I don't actually I'm trying to think maybe or you know [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3972.4s)]
*  actually the only shootings that I saw after March 18th that I can remember off the top of my head [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3977.44s)]
*  were from a helicopter gunship not like you know not not small arms or medium arms but really big [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3981.12s)]
*  big weapons um and of course all those people died but the um uh the types of injuries that we [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3986.56s)]
*  were seeing were mostly explosive and shrapnel injuries now if if a bomb just shreds someone to [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3993.7599999999998s)]
*  pieces they're they're dead there's nothing we can really do about it but uh the types of injuries [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=3998.24s)]
*  we can do something about our injuries basically you know shrapnel injuries from the neck down to [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4002.24s)]
*  the pelvis um and then the the arms and legs obviously but those aren't those usually are [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4006.0s)]
*  less life-threatening just because you can amputate someone's arm if you need to or their leg um [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4010.8s)]
*  and uh yeah in terms of children because I I'm a trauma I'm a I'm trained in trauma [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4015.44s)]
*  surgery which means my job is mostly to stop people from bleeding to death so because of that [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4022.16s)]
*  during mass casualty events I go to what's called the red zone like the red triage area [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4026.2400000000002s)]
*  where the most severe patients are coming and I would say most of those patients were were small [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4030.16s)]
*  kids not like 17 and a half year olds but like you know pre-teen children like you know 12 and 12 and [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4036.24s)]
*  under um that's not because most of the injuries are actually in children but most of the severe [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4041.7599999999998s)]
*  injuries seem to be in children if that makes any sense and it kind of tracks because you know if [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4047.8399999999997s)]
*  you expose you or me to a bomb versus a five-year-old the five-year-old is going to be much more seriously [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4052.64s)]
*  injured yeah um so yeah we were dealing with a lot of a lot of injured children unfortunately [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4056.96s)]
*  but you you wrote a piece for the times last fall in which you talked about surveying 65 [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4062.16s)]
*  healthcare workers like yourself and of them 44 said they quote saw multiple cases of pre-teen [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4070.2400000000002s)]
*  children who had been shot yeah in the head or chest um I mean that should be jarring to people [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4076.56s)]
*  how are these children being shot like this yeah so this was um all of this so the the that that [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4084.48s)]
*  survey was done mostly of people who were in gaza during the during the ground invasion um [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4091.2000000000003s)]
*  when in other words when there was there were israeli troops in the vicinity of the hospitals [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4097.36s)]
*  that they were working in and um and i'm that that i think that's just what explains it i mean [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4101.4400000000005s)]
*  there there are um it's unfortunate but every society's army has people who are sadistic or [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4106.72s)]
*  cruel um and will do things like that like shoot a shot shoot a child in the head um but yeah no the [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4113.44s)]
*  the large majority of us did regularly see children shot in the head or the chest on a on a regular [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4120.08s)]
*  basis like for me i was there um uh like i said march uh 25th to april 8th of that year and every [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4124.719999999999s)]
*  day like on average i saw one kid shot in the head every day um and that's despite the fact that i'm [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4132.24s)]
*  not even the person they call for this like i'm not a neurosurgeon right so that's not i'm not it [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4138.24s)]
*  was just i happened to be there so i'm sure there were many more but but yeah you know what explains [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4142.32s)]
*  it i don't i it's it's conjecture on my part so i'm not i don't know exactly what explains it but i [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4147.2s)]
*  think uh with the you know the october 7th attacks were a shocking atrocity to to israelis especially [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4152.799999999999s)]
*  and there was also a lot of atrocity propaganda that happened afterwards you have the beheaded babies [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4161.679999999999s)]
*  the widespread rape and these kinds of things that there isn't any evidence for so when you've got a [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4169.2s)]
*  when you've got an army that feels like it's fighting for its national survival [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4177.04s)]
*  against people who are constantly being called animals and vermin and other such things um and [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4180.96s)]
*  furthermore there's a humongous power just power disparity like it's like you know like the [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4187.76s)]
*  palestinians have basically very very very little means of self-defense less than one israeli soldier [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4193.12s)]
*  has been killed per day in gaza since the invasion started and so i think palestin or i think israeli [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4197.92s)]
*  soldiers just have the opportunity to do these things if they want to and it's kind of clear [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4205.36s)]
*  that the israeli army is not going to stop them from doing it to just stay with the the circumstances [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4209.04s)]
*  for the palestinians there's a lot of focus on well actually i have a couple questions but i mean [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4214.96s)]
*  short one is the death count seems low to me and and most people that have evaluated this thing [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4222.32s)]
*  it's i mean what is your assessment and i'm not asking you to give me a count but is there how do [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4227.84s)]
*  you even keep track of yeah the number of people who are being killed yeah so this is important [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4232.5599999999995s)]
*  for people to understand the uh in the media it's often said the hamas run ministry of health [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4237.12s)]
*  says this many people have killed have been killed but it doesn't distinguish between [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4242.24s)]
*  combatants and civilians that's all accurate that's all accurate um but it's a little bit [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4245.679999999999s)]
*  misleading firstly i don't know i literally don't know anyone with one exception i don't [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4250.08s)]
*  know anyone who has treated a combatant in gaza uh the um everyone i treated in both the first [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4255.2s)]
*  time and the second time i was there everyone came in with their family and you know you can [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4262.48s)]
*  say whatever you want about hamas no one thinks they're dragging their wives out to the battlefield [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4266.88s)]
*  yeah that's silly the um so i i suspect that combatants are not even really counted in that [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4270.16s)]
*  in that group but the um uh it's basically 100 civilian casualty that we're seeing i'm sure [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4276.799999999999s)]
*  there's one fighter somewhere in there that we just can't see but that's not the common [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4282.639999999999s)]
*  common situation um there is actual data on this question of like like just sticking with violent [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4286.48s)]
*  deaths forget the starvation and the disease and the other things but just sticking with violent [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4291.839999999999s)]
*  deaths there are uh there was once there was a study that was just done in the lancet which is [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4296.5599999999995s)]
*  a major british medical journal and um what they showed so they got the ministry of health's entire [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4301.52s)]
*  database not the aggregate numbers but literally line by line person by person data and they [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4307.040000000001s)]
*  compared that to um a survey that had been done and um uh social media postings and they they [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4311.84s)]
*  kind of did what air wars does where they needed two points to to verify that somebody had been [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4319.200000000001s)]
*  killed like a social media posting and a survey or a social media posting and the ministry of health [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4323.52s)]
*  data something like that and they found that even just sticking to violent deaths the ministry of [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4328.24s)]
*  health was undercounting publicly verifiable deaths by 40 so there's that aspect of it on top of that [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4332.8s)]
*  there's the the major question of uh of what's broadly called famine but it's usually people [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4340.96s)]
*  think of famine as meaning there isn't enough food right but famine really encompasses more than that [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4346.48s)]
*  it encompasses displacement lack of water like drinking water lack of sanitation hygiene [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4350.719999999999s)]
*  infrastructure lack of food obviously um and lack of health care as well and these things these are [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4356.8s)]
*  all things that are under direct and sustained attack um by uh during this assault so the so [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4362.320000000001s)]
*  yeah so nobody knows what the death count is because people aren't allowed to study it it's [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4370.08s)]
*  important for people to understand that with fifty thousand dollars and about three weeks we could [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4374.16s)]
*  answer that question like not me but a public health researcher and the u.s government could answer [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4379.68s)]
*  that question uh it probably could it probably has access to israeli intelligence reports about [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4385.44s)]
*  what's actually going on um but the they probably could yeah at least they could give some sensible [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4390.16s)]
*  some sensible number beyond what what it is but but you know even just like a you could have an [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4398.4s)]
*  academic from yale or or hopkins school of public health or harvard school of public health um answer [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4404.639999999999s)]
*  that question literally in three weeks with 50 grand if the israelis would just allow this study [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4410.799999999999s)]
*  to be done but they won't let these people in so that that's it's just it's one of those things [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4414.56s)]
*  about our own society that we that's how little we care about how many people we're killing [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4418.4800000000005s)]
*  yeah their humanity i mean uh so i i so we're talking about death count that you know [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4422.160000000001s)]
*  could somewhere be in the neighborhood of a hundred thousand um but i i want to talk about [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4429.04s)]
*  wounded people i mean you're a trauma care person you save somebody's life you stop them from [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4433.120000000001s)]
*  bleeding to death look if i was shot or got shrapnel in me you know not that that's going [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4437.68s)]
*  to happen here i imagine i'd recover for a long time in a hospital and then i'd have some kind [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4444.96s)]
*  of home care and i'm trying to imagine people that kind of come through the hospital and out [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4449.200000000001s)]
*  and they are people with horrific wounds they've lost limbs they've lost blood they are risk of [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4454.88s)]
*  infection and they're just turned back out into tents where they're dropping more bombs i mean [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4460.72s)]
*  what is your set look when we hear about famine lack of aid um what do you think about the patients [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4465.52s)]
*  you treat about where how and where they're recovering yeah well yeah so we we uh there's a [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4472.8s)]
*  there how are they recovering honestly a lot of them are not um we see we very regularly find [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4479.92s)]
*  wounds with maggots in them like not from not in the hospital but people coming in from from outside [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4486.160000000001s)]
*  although at european we did find them in the hospital as well just because it was so overcrowded [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4490.240000000001s)]
*  but if you uh if you walk around uh in god like i like i walked between uh there's a um i was at [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4495.04s)]

*  i walked between the two it's maybe like a mile or a mile and a half um and when you're walking [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4507.12s)]
*  around you see tons and tons of people with amputations but they still have like cotton [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4511.2s)]
*  dressings on them and they're just soaked i mean like it's just like they're obviously infected [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4516.24s)]
*  there's no no uh two ways about it but they're they're just trying to power through and and deal [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4520.8s)]
*  with it you know um and yeah i mean obviously there's no rehabilitation there's no like you [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4526.88s)]
*  know the one of the things actually that's uh kind of um remarkable i saw a report from it might have [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4532.56s)]
*  been saved the children i can't remember but it's actually it's very difficult to assist um disabled [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4538.08s)]
*  children but also disabled adults simply because there are very few flat spaces left in gaza like [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4545.2s)]
*  places where you don't have to well yeah well you where you can lie down but also where the [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4550.8s)]
*  the one part of the floor isn't like this and another is is bent and crooked and like [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4554.96s)]
*  just because everything has been bombed and run over by military vehicles and it's just [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4558.8s)]
*  the um and and a lot you got also like a lot of these people are living in bombed out uh homes [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4563.76s)]
*  like the the two walls are missing or the floor is unstable or whatever so if you have to like [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4570.4800000000005s)]
*  climb up a destroyed and slanted roof to get into your second floor apartment because the stairs have [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4576.08s)]
*  been destroyed and then you're there's rubble everywhere like it's just like yeah it keeps the [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4581.76s)]
*  rain off of you but uh like a lot again you actually see this when you're walking around [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4586.24s)]
*  people actually like picking someone up putting them on their back and then trying to ascend up [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4590.08s)]
*  like a mountain of rubble to get into their apartment um it's it's it's wild yeah but yeah [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4594.4s)]
*  there's there's the the ability for people to recover from these injuries because like like [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4600.08s)]
*  you were kind of saying that stopping someone from bleeding to death is the like baseline [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4604.0s)]
*  yeah of medical care that's not real medical care right i mean you didn't die great great but like [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4608.88s)]
*  you're not going to recover you're not going to thrive just because you didn't lead to death if [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4612.96s)]
*  your arms are broken and you're you know blah blah you have a head injury whatever it might be [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4616.400000000001s)]

*  super important and none of that can be done in Gaza right now literally none of it well and [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4626.64s)]
*  you're not a mental health person you're a trauma surgeon but uh what is the mental state that the [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4630.8s)]

*  they all expect their families to die they all expect their children to die um and it's it's [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4661.92s)]

*  through the left side of her brain but it stayed on that side so it's a recoverable injury actually [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4994.48s)]
*  and actually she did quite well from that standpoint uh she didn't talk for after she she left the [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=4998.719999999999s)]

*  you know we're looking it's just a room full of kids lying on the end there were adults too but [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5013.679999999999s)]
*  mostly full of kids lying on the ground and you're just trying to pick out like which one should i [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5018.16s)]
*  start with you know these are triage decisions as a way of doing them but it's still pretty [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5022.48s)]
*  overwhelming at the time but so i find this little girl and i look at her and she's not breathing [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5025.759999999999s)]
*  properly so i do a jaw thrust like if you've ever done like a cpr class they teach you know you just [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5030.08s)]
*  pull the jaw forward that lets somebody's uh because they're kind of obstructing their own [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5033.919999999999s)]
*  airway but by doing that um and all these kids are lying on the ground and kids have big heads [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5037.759999999999s)]
*  and either just getting pushed down like that but anyway so i draw thrust her and she starts [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5042.08s)]
*  breathing again oh good okay this is one we might actually be able to save so i tell the nurses like [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5046.719999999999s)]
*  get ready to let's intubate this girl it's just stuff we have to do so i just have to stand there [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5050.8s)]
*  holding her jaw up for you know three four or five minutes something like that while they're [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5054.8s)]
*  getting set up to do the stuff we need to do and trying to make space and things like that [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5058.16s)]
*  and i still remember while i was looking at her and i'm just looking at this wound bleeding on [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5062.0s)]
*  her face it's not bleeding badly but i'm just looking at it and i remember thinking like [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5066.08s)]
*  did i pay for this shrapnel or did my neighbor or did their neighbor like it's weird like it's it's [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5069.92s)]
*  kind of wild you know i mean it's not like nobody wants shrapnel to be in this little girl's brain [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5074.64s)]
*  like literally no one yet we're doing it's very odd you know um so that was one thing um [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5081.360000000001s)]
*  but the uh the other was that on uh so the last operation i did on march 18th was in a kid named [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5088.88s)]
*  ibrahim barhomi was a 16 year old boy and um on march 23rd he was ready to go home he had injuries [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5094.88s)]
*  to his colon and his rectum from shrapnel uh so we repaired them and we gave him a colostomy where [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5102.88s)]
*  your the colon's coming out to the skin uh and he's 16 most 16 year olds would be pretty pissed [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5107.12s)]
*  off about this but he was pretty chill about it actually he was a nice kid and um uh on the 23rd [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5112.16s)]
*  it was it was the evening and that he had done pretty well that day now he was eating he was [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5120.56s)]
*  walking around like his gut was starting to function in other words so i was like okay he [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5124.64s)]
*  can go home the next day great so at like uh i don't know probably 8 30 or 9 at night i went uh [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5128.08s)]
*  we used to live on the fourth floor of the hospital and the surgical ward the men's surgical ward was [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5133.44s)]
*  on the second floor so i i left our little living quarters after iftar the the evening uh meal in [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5138.32s)]
*  ramadan and went to so so i'm walking to the stairs and i walked past the icu on the fourth [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5144.08s)]
*  floor and there was a doctor i think her name was hanib she grabbed me and she was like for [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5150.32s)]
*  us there's a kid named mohammed that was um transferred over here from another hospital [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5154.8s)]
*  he's bleeding to death like he needs to go to the operating room so i took a look at him that took [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5159.12s)]
*  about 10 minutes and um uh and he was bleeding so i just told them look you guys get the operating [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5162.56s)]
*  room going i'm gonna go change ibrahim's bandages talk to his family about how to take care of this [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5168.320000000001s)]
*  colostomy and um because he's gonna go home the next morning and then i'm gonna come back up here [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5172.8s)]
*  and we'll take care of this kid's case and like literally as i walked out of the icu ibrahim's [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5178.24s)]
*  room exploded the um the israelis fired a missile at uh it's probably a drone fired missile but who [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5182.48s)]
*  knows um at the room uh killing ismael barhoun who they said was the prime minister of gaza [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5187.5199999999995s)]
*  and uh and ibrahim because they were their distant cousins and they had the same last name [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5194.799999999999s)]
*  so the nurses had put them in this into the same room just to make family visits and stuff easier [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5199.04s)]
*  and um so ibrahim was killed as well and you know i uh so the whole the whole hospital went [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5203.599999999999s)]
*  unlocked actually the one i actually didn't even realize that the bomb had hit the hospital it just [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5210.32s)]
*  felt like all the other ones but the palestinians somehow knew right away so they like grabbed us [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5214.4s)]
*  and like put us in like the foreigners and put us in the uh the safer corner of the hospital they [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5218.08s)]
*  thought but the um after about an hour the the administration lifted the lockdown to the hospital [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5222.08s)]
*  because you know they don't know if like are we going to get invaded is there going to be another [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5226.32s)]
*  bombing who knows they lifted it after about an hour so i ran down to the er to see if there was [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5229.28s)]
*  anybody that needed to come up for an operation because this kid mohammed still needed to go to [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5233.36s)]
*  the or and uh when i was down there uh three or four guys ran down with a body in a sheet [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5237.12s)]
*  because you know you couldn't evaluate people in the in this in the blown up ward it was just [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5244.72s)]
*  yeah a disaster so they ran down the the um the stairs with the body and so i said no go go to [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5248.5599999999995s)]
*  the trauma base so i followed them in and when i pulled the sheet off i recognized ibrahim's [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5253.599999999999s)]

*  weigh it weighs on you a little bit but it's it's more just like the like you you know how senseless [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5278.48s)]
*  all of this is you know it's not making anyone safer you know it's not doing anything to help [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5286.08s)]
*  anyone yet we're all just sleepwalking into doing it there's a there's a there's a book i [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5289.92s)]

*  human being in his day-to-day life but uh he and me and he and my politics would not line up at all [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5349.4400000000005s)]

*  when i went to gaza uh the first time he was like oh just be careful you know he's kind of kind of [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5361.92s)]
*  implying that like these these muslims are crazy you gotta watch out you know when i came back though [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5367.6s)]
*  he came to a presentation that i did at the hospital just for like our little local research [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5372.64s)]
*  day about gaza and when i you know i just showed the the people i treated and what i saw and after [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5376.88s)]
*  it he was like froze i had no idea this stuff this is awful like this is crazy you know yeah [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5383.200000000001s)]

*  know he as soon as he saw what was actually going on it was totally untenable for him to continue to [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5403.52s)]
*  to support he just couldn't and um and the vast majority i think with like maybe one exception [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5411.04s)]
*  of normal human beings that i've talked to uh you know they're not people who have some partisan [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5417.2s)]
*  interest but just normal people um are just appalled by this they just can't understand it [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5421.52s)]
*  you know what the hell why why why on earth are we doing this yeah and so but that's the reason [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5426.96s)]
*  that so much of this is hidden you know what i mean like that's the reason there's no press in [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5432.400000000001s)]
*  there well there's nobody's allowed exactly exactly no one no one who is a truly objective observer [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5436.400000000001s)]

*  neoconservative odd strange people the the in the few reporters that do go in with the israeli [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5452.8s)]
*  military and are serious actually still come out with shocking stories like i don't remember there [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5458.56s)]
*  was a there was a cnn reporter who went in um and saw the israelis destroying a cemetery and so he [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5462.8s)]
*  asked him why are you that's how could that have any military oh well there's a tunnel right [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5469.360000000001s)]
*  underneath he said oh can you show no no it's too dangerous please just show it to me so they did [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5473.84s)]
*  and just by simple uh aerial footage and geolocation it's pretty easy to see that [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5478.56s)]
*  they were not under the cemetery at all they were just destroying the cemetery to destroy a cemetery [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5482.8s)]
*  to humiliate people to you know obliterate their cultural heritage to you know make people really [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5486.88s)]
*  feel like we don't belong here you know it's not we have to leave in other words there's nothing [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5492.160000000001s)]

*  making an entire society homeless no nobody is in favor of obliterating obliterating hospitals of [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5522.96s)]

*  yeah that i yes do i want to scream at everybody yeah for sure but um but i also recognize that [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5536.0s)]
*  the reason they're not screaming themselves is because they don't know what's going on and if [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoTBgtQw5k&t=5541.44s)]
