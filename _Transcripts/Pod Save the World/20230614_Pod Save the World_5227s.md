# Donald Trump’s Classified Documents & The Threat to National Security
**Pod Save the World:** [June 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg)
*  Welcome back to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Ben Rhodes. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2.0s)]
*  Ben, I saw our former colleague, it's funny to call her that, Hillary Clinton last night, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2.96s)]
*  our former boss colleague, opponent, really good person. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=7.76s)]
*  Was my boss, but was superior. How about that? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=11.36s)]
*  Yeah, it was funny, right? She certainly outranked us. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=14.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  We never worked directly before her. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=18.48s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=19.52s)]
*  She was at our Pod Save America show in New York last night. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=20.48s)]
*  Lovett and I tried to bait her into a lock him up chant, but it sadly didn't work. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=23.36s)]
*  What a surprise that Lovett couldn't land that plane. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=28.08s)]
*  You will like it though. I asked her about a conversation she had with Vladimir Putin [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=33.04s)]
*  about the horrors that his father lived through during World War II and the siege of Stalingrad, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=42.8s)]
*  the siege of Stalingrad, which people don't know, millions of people died in this battle [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=49.44s)]
*  in World War II, and how that impacted Putin's psychology. It was pretty fascinating. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=53.44s)]
*  There's a lot that is informing Putin's psychology today. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=62.56s)]
*  Bachmuth is like a mini, mini, mini Stalingrad, just a gruesome, grinded out urban warfare. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=67.12s)]
*  This is how much we have a little mind meld on this show, because that was exactly what I said. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=75.84s)]
*  We're going to play a clip so that people can hear a piece of it, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=79.28s)]
*  and we'll play the full things on Pod Save America if you want to hear it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=82.4s)]
*  He starts trying to pull this body out of the pile of bodies, and the body collector is screaming [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=84.72s)]
*  at him, stop it, stop it, you know, get away from there. And he says, no, no, that's my wife, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=89.44000000000001s)]
*  that's my wife, I know it's my wife, and he keeps trying to pull her out. And finally the body [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=93.92s)]
*  collector said, well just take her, take her body, but then you have to return it, you have to get [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=97.92s)]
*  rid of the body. So he took her and she was alive. And he took her back to their apartment [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=101.92s)]
*  and nursed her back to health. And then a few years later, Vladimir Putin was born. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=110.24s)]
*  So he tells me this story, and I'm sitting there thinking, wow, this explains so much. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=116.96s)]
*  Think about this story, and think about the trauma that his family and so many Russian families [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  went through. And in some people, that kind of trauma makes them feel like never again, no war, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=133.04s)]
*  we have to be more compassionate and caring, we have to help people. And in some people, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=140.88s)]
*  it makes them think, I'm going to be on the side that wins. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=147.6s)]
*  So Ben, what you were just saying was exactly my question, which is, you know, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=150.95999999999998s)]
*  this is a story about her dad coming sort of back from the front of the siege, seeing his wife in [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=153.76s)]
*  this situation that she described here. And I asked her, like, how do you make sense of a guy [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=160.24s)]
*  whose family lived through that experience? And then he sends his own people into a very [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=165.04000000000002s)]
*  similar meat grinder in a place like Bakhmut, where young Russian soldiers are just dying at [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  horrific rates. And this was part of that conversation. Yeah, that's a very powerful [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=176.56s)]
*  story and very insightful armchair psychology there by Secretary Clinton. I mean, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=183.2s)]
*  really interesting, because if you consider, okay, that happened in Stalingrad, the most [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=191.11999999999998s)]
*  horrific battlefield of the 20th century, then Putin is kind of born in St. Petersburg, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=197.11999999999998s)]
*  which undergoes this gruesome siege during the war. People don't have enough to eat, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  people are dying of malnutrition. That's kind of where, that's what Vladimir Putin comes from. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=209.12s)]
*  And then he has the trauma of, you know, as we've talked about, packing up the KGB office in East [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=216.64000000000001s)]
*  Germany at the clout of the Soviet Union, there's a lot of anger and kind of rage that informs the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=223.04s)]
*  psychology of Vladimir Putin. And it doesn't start, you know, it's funny, like these debates about [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=230.72s)]
*  the war and its origins in Ukraine. Sometimes they started like the Maidan, the protest movement in [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=238.32s)]
*  Ukraine. Sometimes they start with like NATO enlargement. Sometimes they start with like the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=245.2s)]
*  Iraq war or something or Chechen war. But like, actually, she's right, you start all the way at [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=250.72s)]
*  the beginning and it probably makes more sense. You got to know this guy, you know his family, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=257.6s)]
*  you know his background. Super interesting story and longer conversation with Hillary Clinton about [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=261.52s)]
*  the indictment, how to run against Trump, lots of stuff. So check that out. So Ben, I know we say [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=266.0s)]
*  this a lot, but this might be the craziest news week ever for like POP Day of the World purposes. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=271.76s)]
*  Like if we had an enemies list, we'd be checking them off. Yeah, man. We don't have one. Don't cross us. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=277.68s)]
*  We don't have one. That's the message. Yeah. So today we're going to cover the Trump indictment. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=282.56s)]
*  There's reports of a Chinese spy base in Cuba. I'm sure you'll have thoughts on that. The latest [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=287.84s)]
*  from Ukraine, food aid in Ethiopia, how the conflict in Sudan is really spiraling out of [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=292.72s)]
*  control in a scary way, how cryptocurrency is fueling North Korea's ballistic missile program. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=297.52000000000004s)]
*  Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is dead and then some news out of Iran and Senegal. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=302.96000000000004s)]
*  And then Ben, you just talked with a Pod Save the World fan favorite, the right honorable David [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=309.04s)]
*  Lammy, Labor MP. I'm guessing maybe Boris Johnson came up. What did you guys talk about? Yeah, you [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=315.84000000000003s)]
*  know, he's very right and honorable today. We talked about Boris Johnson's resignation, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=320.32s)]
*  very dramatic, bombastic resignation from parliament after he was going to be found by [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=325.84s)]
*  a parliamentary committee as having lied, which we all knew. And the kind of chaos he's trying to, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=332.0s)]
*  you know, there's some allies of his that are resigning the Tory party. What does that mean [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=338.08s)]
*  for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and the Tories? What does it mean for labor as they get ready [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=341.6s)]
*  to go into election year? We talk about the arrest of Nicola Sturgeon, the former guest of [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=345.36s)]
*  Pod Save the World and leader of the Scottish National Party until recently. You know, interestingly, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=351.44s)]
*  like SMP is a left of center on a lot of things, but they're obviously a competitor to the Labor [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=356.96000000000004s)]
*  Party. So that big time also helps labor can win back those Scotland seats and defeat the weekend [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=363.12s)]
*  Tory party. They're going to be on a roll. That's what David said, basically, to give it a bit of [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=368.16s)]
*  a preview. And then we just talked a bit about how the Trump indictment looks from the perspective [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=372.88s)]
*  of London. And, you know, I think you can hear in David's answer, like, you know, obviously he [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=378.64s)]
*  is very supportive of the rule of law and the checks and balances on display in the US system. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=384.64s)]
*  But like, you know, people in other countries don't know that Trump's not going to be president [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=388.48s)]
*  again, too. And that's a very strange thing to realize when Trump is, as we speak, presenting [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=393.92s)]
*  himself in a Miami courthouse. So it's a good interview. People should check it out. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=401.44s)]
*  Excellent. Always love hearing from David Lammy. I also cannot wait to listen to [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=404.08s)]
*  Pod Save the UK this week, because I imagine those guys, Nish and Coco have been on like a three day [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=407.52s)]
*  Bye Bye Boris vendor. It's been very fun. But so Ben, let's start with Trump and Mar-a-Lago [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=413.04s)]
*  documents. We finally have an indictment in the Mar-a-Lago documents hoarding case. It's a doozy. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=419.52s)]
*  He is charged with 37 criminal counts. 31 of them are related to the willful retention of national [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=425.52s)]
*  defense information. There's five counts of obstruction of justice and two counts of making [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=430.8s)]
*  false statements to the FBI. Trump is being arraigned as we speak on June 13th. Here's a [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=435.44s)]
*  sampling of some of the documents that led to charges against him. This is a description by [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=440.72s)]
*  the government in the document. It's in the indictment. A document concerning military [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=446.32s)]
*  capabilities of a foreign country and the United States. That one is classified top secret slash [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=450.40000000000003s)]
*  si slash no foreign slash FISA means it was gathered via information was gathered via signals [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=456.48s)]
*  intelligence in some sort of collection on a US person that was authorized by a FISA court. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=461.84000000000003s)]
*  There's a document concerning nuclear weaponry of the United States. It was classified secret [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=466.16s)]
*  slash formerly restricted data, which is a category of data related to the military utilization of [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=471.52000000000004s)]
*  atomic weapons. There was a document dated June 20, 20 concerning nuclear capabilities of foreign [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=476.8s)]
*  country. The classification marking on that was top secret slash redacted slash redacted slash [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=482.16s)]
*  or con slash no foreign that I've never seen a classification demarcation redacted before. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=488.72s)]
*  But or con means the agency that collected the data controls its dissemination. No foreign means [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=494.96000000000004s)]
*  you can't give it to non-US citizens. Then there was something about military activity in a foreign [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=499.44000000000005s)]
*  country. That was top secret slash HCS dash P bunch of other acronyms that I won't get into, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=503.36s)]
*  but HCS dash P means information that came from human intelligence, CIA assets, CIA spies around [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=508.96s)]
*  the world. So we're going to leave it to the legal analysts out there to tell us if he's guilty or [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=515.4399999999999s)]
*  not. You know, strict scrutiny is going to record an emergency episode about this. But a couple of [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=521.04s)]
*  things that jumped out at me, Ben, from a national security perspective. First, as we expected, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=526.4s)]
*  the documents Trump took were not like memos from his staff. They were intelligence community and [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=532.0799999999999s)]
*  Pentagon documents, the most sensitive ones possible. Two, DOJ has not said that they know [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=536.96s)]
*  for sure that they've gotten all these documents back. And I think that's interesting and notable. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=542.5600000000001s)]
*  And then, you know, third, despite reports that the special counsel's office had subpoenaed records [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=546.88s)]
*  relating to Trump's business dealings, there's no mention of that in this indictment. Doesn't mean [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=552.48s)]
*  those connections don't exist necessarily or will never be drawn. But you know, you have to assume [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=558.0s)]
*  that if Jack Smith had solid evidence that he had sold these documents or give them to a foreign [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=563.12s)]
*  national, that would be in this indictment, which is sort of gets to the last point, which is [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=567.28s)]
*  it's a very unsatisfying thought that we might never know. We probably will never know whether [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=572.16s)]
*  any of these documents are fell into the wrong hands. I'm sure the Intel community is doing a [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=577.44s)]
*  damage assessment as we speak, but like that won't necessarily be conclusive. So very bad. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=582.24s)]
*  Give me your hottest takes on this thing. What have you been thinking about since you read it? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=589.44s)]
*  I mean, first of all, the when this first broke, right, there was a spectrum of what these documents [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=592.56s)]
*  could be. The most benign end of that spectrum, as we said, was like, you know, the letters with [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=599.5999999999999s)]
*  Kim Jong-un or some call transcripts with foreign leaders that bring back good memories. Then the [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=605.68s)]
*  next rung of the spectrum would essentially be like the intelligence reports that you and I used [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=613.28s)]
*  to read, right, like that are kind of like 10, 15 page analytical summaries of some issue in the [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=619.12s)]
*  world that they're really interesting. Maybe they have some kind of cool insight or anecdote. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=625.44s)]
*  Yeah, the stuff on Discord. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=630.32s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. The stuff that we're reading on Discord. Exactly. What is really shocking to me [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=631.6s)]
*  about this is he's at the far end of the spectrum in terms of the most damaging possible documents [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=640.32s)]
*  in that they're the documents that have the most cost associated with them in terms of [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=647.2s)]
*  U.S. national security and the documents that are like least possible to say they're like, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=652.6400000000001s)]
*  you know, they're dealing with something in the past, you know, so, you know, maybe they [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=659.0400000000001s)]
*  could have shown something about collection like to hone in on one, for instance, as it's been [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=662.96s)]
*  reported widely that one of these documents is like the U.S. war plan to attack Iran, right, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=667.44s)]
*  and attack its nuclear program. Like, there is no way in which that document could possibly not be [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=673.12s)]
*  incredibly sensitive because it's about something in the future, you know. It's not even like an [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=680.8s)]
*  analytical assessment of something that happened already. It's about plans for things that would [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=685.52s)]
*  have to happen in the future. And if you looked at that document, and I've looked at, you know, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=689.92s)]
*  similar documents over the years, like it would, you could look at it and you could not only [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=695.44s)]
*  understand like what do we want to strike or what do we understand about the Iranian nuclear program [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=700.72s)]
*  and, you know, where we might want to target, but also you can kind of surmise from that. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=705.2s)]
*  Where would the U.S. position military assets to carry out an attack? Would we need cooperation [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=710.5600000000001s)]
*  from other countries in terms of positioning resources or airspace permissions and things [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=716.88s)]
*  like that? I mean, this is something that if it's out in the open, like the Pentagon has to revise [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=722.32s)]
*  its plan around this. And to be clear, like, I hope we'd never have to use that plan, but like, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=728.96s)]
*  it is incredibly sensitive, right? Yeah, just to clarify, like, people might be thinking, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=733.6s)]
*  why the hell was the Pentagon drawing up war plans with Iran? Because that's their job. The [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=738.0s)]
*  Chairman of the Joint Chief's Office, they have plans for everything. That's what they do. And to [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=741.44s)]
*  your point, Ben, Trump claiming that he declassified the thing, I mean, someone should probably have [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=745.6s)]
*  told the Pentagon that because now they have to write up a new war plan if that were to be true. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=749.76s)]
*  I mean, it just like exposes how ludicrous these arguments are. And that's my point. It's like, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=753.9200000000001s)]
*  you literally can't really declassify that, you know, because if it was a document that's [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=757.52s)]
*  something that already happened, okay, you have to do a damage assessment. You have to say, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=761.6s)]
*  would the revelation of this document allow someone to figure out, you know, that we were [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=766.3199999999999s)]
*  listening in on certain conversations or we had a spy somewhere? This is about something that hasn't [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=770.3199999999999s)]
*  happened, right? So that jumped out to me. The fact that this does include documents that rely [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=775.68s)]
*  on human sources demonstrates that like the revelation of these documents or they get in [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=780.72s)]
*  the wrong hands, that that could literally put someone's life in danger. That is not an [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=785.04s)]
*  overstatement, you know, because that's the nature of human intelligence. That's the nature of spying. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=788.9599999999999s)]
*  And the things that jumped out to me, like the hot takes, I would add to this initial conversation, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=794.4s)]
*  again, we know from reporting that like there's this recording of him talking to like Mark Meadows [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=801.1999999999999s)]
*  biographers about like, you know, presumably- About the Iran War Plan. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=806.16s)]
*  The Iran War Plan, right? So he's taken out this document. He's like, you know, I shouldn't be [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=809.12s)]
*  showing this to you. I didn't declassify this. But what really jumped out to me about that is [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=812.88s)]
*  if he's showing this document to the Mark Meadows biographers, like who the fuck else did he show [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=817.76s)]
*  that document to? You know, like- Imagine what he's showing the caterers. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=823.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's not the only people, you know, and I know this goes beyond what- [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=825.12s)]
*  Showing off. Yeah. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=828.88s)]
*  Jack Smith can only focus on what he knows and if he has a recording, then he knows that. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=829.92s)]
*  But to your point of what we don't know, we have no idea who the hell he was showing this to for [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=833.92s)]
*  the last couple years, you know? And all these documents, we know from the kind of photos that [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=838.48s)]
*  were released that these documents were like, they were in ballrooms. They were kind of like [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=845.04s)]
*  hanging out around Mar-a-Lago. These weren't even in like a locked closet. Like this is the kind of [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=849.2s)]
*  stuff that, again, Mar-a-Lago has been likely the number one intelligence target in the entire world. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=853.9200000000001s)]
*  Hold on, Ben. That's unfair. Republican Congressman Byron Donalds pointed out that [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=861.36s)]
*  there's 33 bathrooms at Mar-a-Lago, so don't act like it's a random bathroom that guests can just [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=865.2s)]
*  go into. That's an exact quote. And Kevin McCarthy pointed out that bathrooms can lock, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=869.76s)]
*  unlike Joe Biden's garage, although he seems to have, I don't know, maybe not been inside [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=874.72s)]
*  a bathroom recently and realized that they lock from the inside usually. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=878.72s)]
*  Well, and Joe Biden- People out of bathrooms. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=881.76s)]
*  Yeah. And Joe Biden's not exactly having like weddings and parties and fundraisers and, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=883.6s)]
*  you know, bar mitzvahs and- Thousands of people. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=890.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. It's a country club. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=891.84s)]
*  I mean, again, like people have to occupy this reality because they hear people say, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=892.8s)]
*  national security, well, you know, that's hyperbolic. The Chinese and Russians, there's [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=897.3599999999999s)]
*  no question in anybody's mind that they've been trying to get into Mar-a-Lago since 2016, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=902.3199999999999s)]
*  if not before. And if you think they're not good enough to figure out how to get someone into a [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=907.8399999999999s)]
*  wedding or get someone to a party- Or a job as a caterer. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=912.16s)]
*  Yeah, job as a caterer. Like you haven't clearly watched enough spy movies because [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=915.68s)]
*  they've definitely been trying to do that. So to me, the main takeaways are this is the most [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=920.64s)]
*  sensitive possible documents you could have taken. There's real and significant risk that these [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=926.48s)]
*  documents are compromised. And yeah, we still don't know the motivation. Hopefully that comes [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=934.32s)]
*  out in the course of the trial. Maybe that Jack Smith has a couple of things up his sleeve. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=938.8000000000001s)]
*  But this is real. And like people looking at this around the world, in addition to just thinking [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=943.6s)]
*  how under this guy's still like a front runner for the Republican nomination, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=947.84s)]
*  genuinely should be asking themselves, and I'm sure are, do I want to cooperate with the United [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=952.32s)]
*  States? Do I want to spy for the United States? Do I want to share my intel with the United States [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=956.8000000000001s)]
*  if it's going to end up in the ballroom of Mar-a-Lago? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=961.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, box next to a toilet. Yeah, we've not heard anything that's indictment about [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=964.4s)]
*  the possible giving these documents to foreign governments. That doesn't mean that the kickbacks [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=968.88s)]
*  from these foreign governments haven't come in. Don't take our word for it. Let's hear Republican [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=975.36s)]
*  presidential candidate Chris Christie talking about the Trump family and the money they've made [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=979.92s)]
*  in the past few years. Pay your hotel rates on the taxpayers' dime too. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=985.28s)]
*  Because let me tell you something, everybody. The grift from this family is breathtaking. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=989.12s)]
*  It's breathtaking. Jared Kushner and Ivanka Kushner walk out of the White House and months [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=995.2s)]
*  later get $2 billion from the Saudis. $2 billion from the Saudis. You think it's because he's some [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1001.92s)]
*  kind of investing genius? Or do you think it's because he was sitting next to the president of [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1010.0799999999999s)]
*  the United States for four years doing favors for the Saudis? That's your money. That's your money he [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1014.3199999999999s)]
*  stole and gave it to his family. Know what that makes us? A banana republic. That's what it makes us. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1020.7199999999999s)]
*  Shut the fuck up, Christie. Let's cut him off. That's my line. He stole my line. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1028.56s)]
*  The thing about investment genius, I think I've used that like five times. I was going to say, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1037.12s)]
*  Chris, don't forget to rate and review the episodes. It helps people find us in the [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1041.2s)]
*  iTunes store. We really appreciate it. I like seeing him out there. Listen, I don't like Chris [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1046.0s)]
*  Christie. You don't have to like him either. But a whole bunch of us might be giving that guy $1 so [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1051.6s)]
*  he ends up on the debate stage and just get yourself okay with that. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1055.28s)]
*  It also makes you wonder, some Democrats have gone there, but why hasn't every Democrat and [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1060.3999999999999s)]
*  Congress been saying exactly that for the last couple of years? Every now and then you see a [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1065.52s)]
*  Republican do the gut punch and you're like, man, I wish we had gut punchers like that. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1070.16s)]
*  But yeah, he's raising the right questions. And to connect it to the document thing, Tommy, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1078.6399999999999s)]
*  we know that Trump was hosting live golf tour events and different, Bedminster, I think, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1082.72s)]
*  had one. You honestly think that he dusts off the old Iran war plan for the Mark Meadows biographer [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1088.88s)]
*  and he doesn't think like, oh, I got some Saudis coming for the live tour. Maybe I'll dust that bad [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1097.04s)]
*  boy off and throw in my briefcase and take it up to Bedminster for the day. This is a real issue, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1102.5600000000002s)]
*  real concern that like, what has he been sharing with the Saudis? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1108.08s)]
*  Yeah, 100% chance he has done it, in my opinion. Okay, Ben, so speaking of spying, over the weekend, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1111.84s)]
*  the Biden administration disclosed the existence of a now no longer secret Chinese eavesdropping [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1118.6399999999999s)]
*  base in Cuba. This news came out in sort of a weird way. Last week, the Wall Street Journal [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1124.3999999999999s)]
*  reported that China and Cuba had reached some sort of secret deal where the Chinese government [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1129.52s)]
*  would pay the Cubans billions of dollars for permission to establish a base on the island of [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1134.32s)]
*  Cuba. The White House initially said, no, the story is inaccurate. But it turns out what was [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1139.52s)]
*  inaccurate about the Wall Street Journal story was the suggestion that this base was new, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1144.1599999999999s)]
*  when in fact, it had been set up in 2019 and maybe had been like refurbished recently. I don't know. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1148.6399999999999s)]
*  But, you know, first of all, it's a good window into why being a national security spokesperson [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1153.28s)]
*  is very complicated because, you know, the White House reads this story, they know parts of it are [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1157.4399999999998s)]
*  wrong. But you can't explain what's right and what's wrong until you get the intelligence [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1161.36s)]
*  community to declassify a bunch of information so you can put out the real facts, which they [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1165.6s)]
*  did, I think, on Saturday. But then Biden's team clearly wanted everyone to know that this base [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1170.24s)]
*  was set up during the Trump administration, that they got briefed on it during the transition. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1176.24s)]
*  And I think Politico suggested that maybe they wanted to avoid, you know, sort of a Chinese spy [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1181.1999999999998s)]
*  balloon style blow up because Tony Blinken, the secretary of state, was supposed to visit China [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1187.2s)]
*  next week. More recently, we learned about China's attempts to build a military base in the UAE. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1192.56s)]
*  But Ben, I mean, what do you make of these reports in the sort of broader sense of the [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1198.4s)]
*  Cuba-China relationship? Is that longstanding? Does this sound new to you? Like, what was your take? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1203.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's longstanding. But my take is 2019 is a very notable year, okay? Because we have the [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1209.28s)]
*  opening to Cuba. And what that's doing is that that is providing, like, you know, an infusion of [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1218.8s)]
*  additional resources to Cubans, right? Because more Americans are traveling down there. There's [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1224.6399999999999s)]
*  kind of a tourism industry that is building out. There are these small businesses, a Cuban private [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1229.04s)]
*  sector of people that own restaurants and drive taxis and things like that. Trump comes in and he [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1234.0s)]
*  rolls back a big piece of that opening in 2017. But then Marco Rubio and all these guys, like, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1241.6s)]
*  convince him to go further and further and further and sanction and sanction and sanction [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1248.4s)]
*  through 2018. And so, lo and behold, 2019, the Cubans take the step because they have nowhere [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1252.72s)]
*  else to go, right? Like, we basically delivered Cuba into the arms of the Chinese. The timing [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1259.92s)]
*  is incredibly revelatory because that is precisely when Trump went to a maximalist sanctions policy. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1268.5600000000002s)]
*  And if you are a small island state that has been in a conflict with the United States, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1275.92s)]
*  that bets on a different approach of opening up to the United States and then gets the door slammed [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1281.04s)]
*  in your face such that suddenly you have a humanitarian crisis in your country. Suddenly, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1286.8s)]
*  like, you've got an outflow of people to the U.S. border. Like, you have nowhere to turn [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1292.56s)]
*  but to China and Russia. And so we've talked about the insanity of U.S.-Cuba policy because it hurts [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1299.36s)]
*  Cuban people. We've talked about the insanity of U.S.-Cuba policy because it is driving a [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1305.12s)]
*  migration crisis to our border. But the geopolitics of it are actually even dumber because we're [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1309.44s)]
*  basically saying, hey, there's this island 90 miles from Florida. Because of our politics with [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1315.76s)]
*  Bob Menendez and some people in Florida, we're going to have a total sanctions wall around this [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1321.44s)]
*  country such that not only can they not get U.S. investment but they can't get any investment from [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1326.8799999999999s)]
*  Europe either. What do you think is going to happen? They're going to turn to the only option [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1331.28s)]
*  they have, which is China and Russia. So the U.S., the United States government is kind of like a [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1336.0s)]
*  co-investor in that base because we gave the Cubans nowhere else to go. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1342.96s)]
*  Yeah, we got some equity in that base. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1347.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's absolute insanity and it just shows you how stupid this policy is. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1349.68s)]
*  Part of why I found Hillary Clinton's story about Vladimir Putin's father so interesting [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1354.16s)]
*  is that the heart of diplomacy is trying to have empathy for your adversaries and your friends, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1359.76s)]
*  right? And sort of like see the world from their perspective. So Vladimir Putin thinks [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1365.3600000000001s)]
*  the Nazis would have slaughtered us all if we didn't fucking take the fight to them, right? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1370.56s)]
*  To your point, the Cubans couldn't hold their May Day parade this year because the island had [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1374.88s)]
*  run out of gasoline. That's how desperate they are. This comes after COVID, after U.S. sanctions. So [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1381.44s)]
*  I'm not defending the decision to set up a Chinese spy base, but of course, let's look at a place you [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1387.04s)]
*  would turn for an infusion of capital. No, in my experience, right? So I negotiated with the Cubans [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1392.24s)]
*  over many years. I spent hundreds, probably thousands of hours with senior members of the [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1398.72s)]
*  Cuban government up to Raul Castro, who was then the president of Cuba. And what was very clear to [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1403.76s)]
*  me is that there were divisions inside of that system, right? So you had some people that were [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1408.72s)]
*  more pragmatic who were thinking, there's still guys that we don't agree with. There's still [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1413.44s)]
*  autocrats, but they're thinking like, you know what? We need to diversify. We should open up [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1417.44s)]
*  to the U.S. We should open up to Western investment. It's a better bet for us in the long run. If it [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1422.08s)]
*  means we have to tolerate the internet coming online in Cuba, tolerate people coming here with [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1426.96s)]
*  different political ideas, we're willing to take that risk. I knew at the time that there were [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1432.4s)]
*  hardliners in the Cuban system that did not like the opening. The kind of really retro guys in the [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1437.6000000000001s)]
*  Cuban military and other aspects of the Cuban system that didn't like the opening. And Fidel [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1443.04s)]
*  Castro himself criticized the opening. He was clearly in a different place, even from his brother. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1448.16s)]
*  And what happened is when Trump slammed the door in their face, it dramatically undercut all the [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1452.56s)]
*  people that had participated in, negotiated, and supported that opening of the United States. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1458.56s)]
*  And the hardliners came in and said, you are wrong. We should just throw our lot in with the [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1463.76s)]
*  Chinese and Russians. It's the only way that we can get any resources. And look, the check that [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1468.1599999999999s)]
*  they get from the Chinese with that base is not the kind of sustained revenue that would come from [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1472.8s)]
*  travel from Americans, who, by the way, want to go to Cuba. But yeah, it doesn't make them right, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1477.36s)]
*  but it makes them rational, self-interested actors that if the United States government is [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1482.08s)]
*  not going to give them any capacity to do any business with anybody that is one of our friends [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1486.96s)]
*  and allies, they're just going to be left with Russia, China. The same thing has happened in [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1491.36s)]
*  Venezuela, where Russia and China have enormous influence. So you know what? The Biden administration [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1495.84s)]
*  can't say out of one side of its mouth, we're running a strategy to try to prevent Russian [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1500.8799999999999s)]
*  and Chinese influence in this hemisphere. And the other hand, set up a bunch of policies that give [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1505.84s)]
*  countries in this hemisphere no choice but to deal with Russia and China. It's insanity. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1510.08s)]
*  Pod Save the World is brought to you by the International Rescue Committee. The International [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1514.32s)]

*  style, and they just cleared a huge wait list. It's designed for everyday wear, made with organic [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1592.56s)]
*  cotton canvas, and comes in timeless shades like white, gray, red, and blue. The perfect pair for [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1596.8s)]
*  all your summer outfits and days spent on your feet and out in the sunshine. We love the lace-up [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1601.9199999999998s)]
*  Oka for years, and now Karyuma recently launched Canvas Slip-ons. They're 100% vegan. They're made [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1606.08s)]

*  Listen, it's particularly great when you need to slip something on, run out, walk the dog, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1621.1200000000001s)]
*  you're moving fast, get those slip-ons. Karyuma's always keeping it fresh with epic collaborations [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1624.4s)]

*  summer shades, made in collaboration with Pantone. Three new sneakers bursting with life for a season, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1633.1200000000001s)]
*  packed with fun, full of flavor, lots of very fun new colors. You should all check them out. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1637.6s)]
*  Karyuma is B Corp certified and has a dedicated reforestation program based in the Brazilian [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1641.52s)]
*  rainforest. Their co-founders Dave and Fernando both grew up there, so this project is especially [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1646.16s)]
*  close to home. For every pair of sneakers sold, Karyuma plants two trees, and they're already [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1650.96s)]
*  planted over 2 million trees. To date, that is a lot of trees. Karyuma ships all their sneakers [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1655.44s)]

*  time. Speaking of Russia, Ben, so lots of news out of Ukraine this week. The long awaited [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1683.04s)]
*  Ukrainian counteroffensive has officially begun. Zelensky has confirmed as much. The reporting so [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1689.12s)]
*  far seems to suggest that the Ukrainian military is probing the Russian lines in a whole bunch of [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1693.6s)]
*  places before deciding where to go all in with these newly trained, newly armed units. There's [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1700.0s)]
*  been some limited success so far. They've retaken some small villages, but things have been [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1706.8s)]
*  complicated by rainstorms and mud that make it hard to move heavy equipment. Rain or shine, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1711.36s)]
*  though, this is going to be a very difficult, long process getting through these Russian minefields [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1715.84s)]
*  and fortifications. So expect this to take months before we, I think, have a verdict on whether it's [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1720.0s)]
*  worked or not. Last week, we mentioned this sabotage, the Kakovka Dam in eastern Ukraine, [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1724.64s)]
*  which is holding back a body of water the size of the Great Salt Lake in Utah, which is now [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1731.2s)]
*  pouring into the ocean. Seems clear now that the dam was blown up probably from the inside by the [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1735.76s)]
*  Russians who were occupying it at the time. The floodwaters have displaced thousands of people. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1740.48s)]
*  It's creating this ecological catastrophe that is being routinely described as the Ukraine's worst [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1744.8s)]
*  environmental disaster since the Chernobyl nuclear meltdown. Think about that for a minute. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1750.64s)]
*  Massive amounts of farmland is unusable. Landmines are washing down screen. Oil and gas, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1755.68s)]
*  it's just a disaster. The Ukrainian government in the UN are providing relief to those affected [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1759.84s)]
*  in Ukrainian-occupied areas, but the Russians are doing nothing to help the people in the areas [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1765.68s)]
*  they control that are getting flooded out despite being there to liberate them ostensibly. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1772.0s)]
*  They won't even give the UN security guarantees so they can go in and help. Instead, the Russians [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1775.92s)]
*  are shooting at people evacuating the flooded parts of Ukraine. So that tells you who they are. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1779.92s)]
*  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made a surprise visit to Ukraine, pledged some money. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1786.8s)]
*  Joe Biden pledged another $325 million in aid. Leaders of France, Germany, Poland got together [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1791.04s)]
*  in Paris to reaffirm their support. So lots of diplomatic activity happening. So then lots going [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1795.68s)]
*  on here. There is this big ongoing debate that I think has both military implications and political [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1799.92s)]
*  implications for Joe Biden and everybody else supporting this war about what success looks like. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1806.16s)]
*  The New York Times tried to shorthand it in a piece I think over the weekend. They talked about [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1811.04s)]
*  it being Ukraine retaking and holding important territory and brushing back the Russian military [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1815.76s)]
*  to the point where it kind of raises fundamental questions about their capacity. Failure would be, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1821.3600000000001s)]
*  we give Ukraine all this new equipment, all this new training, and it just has no impact [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1828.48s)]
*  militarily. Does that sound about right to you? Yeah. I mean, we've talked about this [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1832.8799999999999s)]
*  expectations question and it's been interesting to see that in the run-up to the offensive, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1836.72s)]
*  the expectation setting was very maximalist. It was like victory, victory, victory. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1842.6399999999999s)]
*  And then as soon as it began, it's like, I think a smart effort to lower expectations. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1846.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, in my mind, it would seem like, and you see this in the reporting that like, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1852.0s)]
*  if they could break that land bridge, if they could take back pieces of southern Ukraine that [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1858.56s)]
*  separate Crimea from what Russia controls in eastern Ukraine, that that would be a very [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1862.16s)]
*  successful counteroffensive. But that's not easy at all given that Russia has been able to dig in [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1866.8s)]
*  and fortify. It's harder to make progress the longer the Russians have had to prepare. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1873.2s)]
*  The only other thing I'd put into this mix, Tommy, after your good summary is that there's been this [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1877.9199999999998s)]
*  question of like, what would Russia do to escalate? I think the damn explosion, presuming that was [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1885.04s)]
*  Russia and it certainly seems that way. That's a pretty good indication that they are willing to [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1891.52s)]
*  do some shit that, as you said- Massive war crime. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1896.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And no caring for even their own people. The only reason there was some question over who did [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1899.12s)]
*  this at first is that it hurt a lot of people in Russian controlled areas. It hurt kind of a water [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1905.04s)]
*  resource for Crimea. The fact that the Russians clearly just look at Ukraine as like a map and [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1909.52s)]
*  could give a shit about any people there, including the people that, like you said, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1916.96s)]
*  they claim to liberate the Russian speaking populations. That's worrying to me because [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1920.72s)]
*  it is a sign that they're willing to escalate beyond just kind of bombing war crimes to more, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1926.8s)]
*  in this case, an ecological disaster. The nuclear question is still out there. So it does suggest [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1934.08s)]
*  that there's places that Russia can go in defense of the territory it's claimed [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1941.52s)]
*  that are quite escalatory. And Ukraine's going to be dealing with the after effects of this dam [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1949.12s)]
*  for a very long time. Yeah, for years and years and years. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1954.1599999999999s)]
*  So I mentioned the politics of this and sort of like what it means for Joe Biden in sustaining [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1957.76s)]
*  political support. I just want to talk about two examples, one on the Democratic side and one on [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1961.6s)]
*  the Republican side of sort of where the policy conversation is shifting. The first is just a [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1965.36s)]
*  quick clip of now Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. talking about Ukraine. It's [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1971.1999999999998s)]
*  on Fox News. Worst of all, we've killed 350,000 Ukrainian kids for a sham, something that, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1977.6s)]
*  we're, they are going and fighting, believing that they're fighting for their nation. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1989.1200000000001s)]
*  But we're not doing that, right? That's the Russians doing that. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=1994.64s)]
*  Well, but what was our history of provocations? You had George Kennan, who's our senior, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2000.32s)]
*  the most important diplomat in our country in our history, who designed the containment policy [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2008.08s)]
*  during the Cold War. Bill Meyers, who was the, excuse me, President Clinton's secretary of state, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2013.76s)]
*  William Barrie, who said, both of them and the current CIA director, Bill Burns, have all warned [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2028.88s)]
*  in advance, if you try to move NATO East to the Russian borders, it is going to force the Russians [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2037.6s)]
*  into a war with the United States. And then, you know, we spend $5 billion. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2044.9599999999998s)]
*  You would want to put an end to that. I bet. Okay. People can debate that. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2051.8399999999997s)]
*  So I just want to be clear that we didn't choose that clip to like [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2055.44s)]
*  mock his voice in any way. He's got a rare disorder that impacts the muscle in his larynx. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2059.12s)]
*  The issue we had was the substance of what he's saying there. Like, RFK Jr. is blaming George [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2063.12s)]
*  Kennan, an American diplomat who was born in 1904 and died in 2005 for Putin's decision to invade [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2067.92s)]
*  in 2020. You and I have had a number of conversations. We had Peter Beinart on the [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2075.68s)]
*  show to talk about NATO expansion and how it made the Russians feel boxed in. It was maybe a bad [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2079.68s)]
*  idea at some points. But the idea that we, the U.S., forced Putin to invade Ukraine is fucking [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2086.08s)]
*  ludicrous. And this guy is polling at like 20 percent. Jack Dorsey, former Twitter CEO, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2093.36s)]
*  is endorsing him. Elon Musk is lifting him up on social media. The debate is getting very weird on [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2098.88s)]
*  this stuff then. No, there's a kind of zeitgeist out there that RFK Jr.'s in, which is like the [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2105.44s)]
*  you know, libertarian, anti-woke, anti-establishment. And it's easy to kind of [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2113.52s)]
*  roll your eyes at it. But I think that you can miscalculate how profoundly there's a vein of [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2124.8s)]
*  public opinion on both the left and the right that just distrust U.S. foreign policy. And it's [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2133.12s)]
*  post-Iraq war chiefly. I mean, it's always been there, but I think since the Iraq war in Vietnam, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2139.68s)]
*  it's very pronounced. And I think that there are these assumptions about support for something like [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2145.52s)]
*  the war in Ukraine that are just really shallow. Because even at the height of support for Ukraine, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2150.96s)]
*  even in the early days of the war, when there was this kind of outpouring and the media kind [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2158.32s)]
*  of reflected a sense of total support for Ukraine, you look at a poll and it was like a hover and 50% [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2163.04s)]
*  support. I just think people in the foreign policy establishment and the political establishment [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2172.24s)]
*  ignore at their peril. It's not to say he's not right. I'm not saying that. I'm saying it's wrong [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2178.16s)]
*  to treat that as like some quack view. Or that it's self-evident that it's a quack view. Because [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2183.92s)]
*  it probably sounds compelling to a lot of people. Yeah, it is. Well, why should we? Someone [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2189.6s)]
*  expanded NATO's foreign military alliances to Mexico. What would we do? There are all kinds [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2194.3199999999997s)]
*  of ways of framing it. The bottom line is that that's Donald Trump's position. That's the only [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2200.4s)]
*  challenger to Joe Biden, the Democratic Party's position. That's the position of a bunch of people [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2205.12s)]
*  in Congress. And it's kind of the position that could travel in an election year. So I think [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2208.7999999999997s)]
*  the point is you should never take for granted this support. That Joe Biden is going to have to [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2216.16s)]
*  explain all the time why we're doing this. And not just assume that everybody agrees that it's a [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2222.0s)]
*  great thing that we're in this war through a proxy that we're arming them. Because I think that there's [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2228.3999999999996s)]
*  more traction out there for that view than people might think. I do too. There's another guy on the [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2234.96s)]
*  Republican field named Vivek Ramaswamy. He's a sort of businessman who came out of nowhere, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2239.92s)]
*  is doing surprisingly well. It's early. I don't think he'll necessarily sustain it. But his plan [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2244.96s)]
*  when it comes to Ukraine is to basically end US military support for Ukraine and try to cut the [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2250.16s)]
*  following peace deal, which is to get Russia to agree to end its military alliance with China, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2256.32s)]
*  withdraw weapons from sort of the Ukraine region, rejoin the START Treaty, and then exchange. He [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2262.32s)]
*  just wants to give the Donbass region and Eastern Ukraine to the Russians, end Ukraine's effort to [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2268.64s)]
*  join NATO. Because I guess he doesn't think partitioning a country has ever ended badly, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2274.88s)]
*  or he apparently thinks that Putin would actually abide by this agreement over the long term. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2280.6400000000003s)]
*  But this guy is getting some traction. Well, and to your point, Vivek and RFK Jr. are both the kind [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2285.6800000000003s)]
*  of guys who swim in the sea of Elon and David Sacks, the all-in-pod bros. Little Joe Rose. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2295.52s)]
*  Little Joe Rogan flavor. And the thing is actually, those people are incredibly powerful [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2305.28s)]
*  people. Not David Sacks, but Elon Musk owns Twitter. Jack Dorsey. These are people with a [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2311.2000000000003s)]
*  lot of resources who, if they want to push certain content, they want to drive certain arguments into [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2320.48s)]
*  the mainstream, they can do that. And so I just think that the people, when they talk about [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2327.6800000000003s)]
*  Ukraine, are going to have to explain core principles of why we're doing this, because [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2334.64s)]
*  this is going to be a building sentiment. And if the Ukrainians don't get a lot done in this [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2341.92s)]
*  counteroffensive, and if there's more loss of life, then there's another argument of, well, we should [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2347.52s)]
*  stop the killing in Ukraine. We're prolonging a war that isn't leading someplace. So I just think [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2352.24s)]
*  it's not that I agree with those views, but you've got to make the argument. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2358.16s)]
*  All right. So some troubling news out of Ethiopia, Ben, where the US government is suspending food [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2361.6s)]
*  aid after an investigation found that Ethiopian government officials were stealing food assistance [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2366.3199999999997s)]
*  from USAID and the World Food Program, and using it to feed the military, and then also selling [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2371.68s)]
*  grain to millers in Ethiopia, who then ground it into flour and re-exported it to places like Kenya [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2376.9599999999996s)]
*  and Somalia. The USAID told The Post after a country-wide review, USAID determined in [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2383.44s)]
*  coordination with the government of Ethiopia that a widespread and coordinated campaign is diverting [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2390.64s)]
*  food assistance. We cannot move forward with distribution of food assistance until reforms [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2394.4s)]
*  are in place. So this is like a hard stop on USAID's work. Ethiopia, as we talked about before, [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2398.96s)]
*  they've been fighting this horrific civil war for the last two years. The entire Horn of Africa [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2404.8s)]
*  is struggling after five failed rainy seasons, which have led to droughts and failed crops. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2409.12s)]
*  20 million people in Ethiopia are on the brink of starvation, and it's the largest recipient of food [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2414.24s)]
*  aid in the world currently. So USAID did this in phases. They first cut off food aid to the northern [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2419.12s)]
*  part of the country because it was being used to feed rebels up there. But I think this investigation [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2425.44s)]
*  they did basically found diversion of food aid in every area they looked at. The Ethiopian Foreign [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2430.48s)]
*  Ministry said they're going to work with us on an investigation, but I don't know, even if this was [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2438.08s)]
*  mostly done by local officials, you got to assume there's pretty serious questions about what Prime [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2443.12s)]
*  Minister Abiy Ahmed's government knew or allowed to happen, or questions about the World Food [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2448.24s)]
*  Program's ability to monitor its own programs. The theft was not at all subtle. The Washington Post [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2453.36s)]
*  pointed out that there was one town in Ethiopia that had two flour mills, despite the fact that [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2459.04s)]
*  there were no wheat fields within 300 miles of these facilities, and there were just bags labeled [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2464.24s)]
*  USAID and World Food Program sitting out in front of them. So it didn't take Sherlock Holmes to figure [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2469.7599999999998s)]
*  this out. But Ben, you read a story like this, and it's the most demoralizing thing in the world [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2475.2799999999997s)]
*  because well-intentioned programs are getting stopped and won't be able to help these people. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2480.72s)]
*  It's so damaging for people in Ethiopia. It's so damaging for political support for foreign [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2486.3999999999996s)]
*  assistance programs when opponents of them can lift up programs like this. It's just like, [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2491.6s)]
*  makes you just want to scream. Yeah, and it could exacerbate, obviously, the near-term food and [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2497.12s)]
*  nutrition issues in Ethiopia. I would hope that the goal is to try to find some new mechanism for [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2503.2s)]
*  delivery rather than just kind of pull up stakes. I mean, I understand why USAID took the step they [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2510.4s)]
*  did, obviously, but you really don't want the U.S. to be absented from the capacity to provide food [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2515.04s)]
*  aid to someplace like that. So hopefully, the goal is, can we find some other delivery mechanism? [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2521.12s)]
*  Can they make an example of some local officials? Because if the U.S. is kind of out of that space [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2526.56s)]
*  and other countries, potentially donor countries, are out of that space, then you're just going to [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2534.7999999999997s)]
*  create an even worse situation in terms of not just humanitarian crisis, but it kind of like, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2539.3599999999997s)]
*  the worst actors are often empowered by our absence. So my hope is that they can try to [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2544.56s)]
*  work to remedy this and resume, recognizing that there's a higher bar now, as there should be, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2554.48s)]
*  because otherwise, it's pretty grim. Yeah, it's dire. Staying in Eastern Africa, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2560.72s)]
*  unfortunately, things are getting far worse in Sudan. So back in April, the Sudanese military [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2565.2799999999997s)]
*  started fighting with a paramilitary force in Sudan called the Rapid Support Forces, or RSF. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2570.0s)]
*  They had been partners, the military and the RSF, following a 2021 military coup that deposed the [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2575.52s)]
*  civilian government, but then they broke out to the Civil War. The heaviest fighting started in [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2581.92s)]
*  Khartoum, Sudan's capital, but it has spread to other parts of the country, including the Darfur [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2586.96s)]
*  region, where militia groups are using the power vacuum to take territory, settle old scores, [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2591.04s)]
*  etc. I'm sure a lot of listeners know that Darfur is the place where one of the worst [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2597.52s)]
*  genocides in modern history occurred. That was when Arab militias called the Janjaweed [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2602.4s)]
*  slaughtered mostly non-Arab tribal groups. Many of those Janjaweed militias later became the RSF, [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2607.6s)]
*  so a lot of the same actors here. So you're starting to see activists sound the alarm [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2614.32s)]
*  about fear that the Darfur genocide is restarting. The governor of Darfur called on citizen [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2619.12s)]
*  to take up arms and defend themselves from attacks from the RSF. According to Al Jazeera, [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2627.44s)]
*  there's a doctor's association in Darfur compared the intensity of fighting in one city to the [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2632.4s)]
*  Rwandan genocide in 1994. The US and the Saudis have been trying to organize these peace talks [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2637.28s)]
*  in negotiating these sporadic ceasefires, but they seem to quickly get broken. And to the extent that [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2642.8s)]
*  the ceasefires have worked, it's really seemingly only in Khartoum, not in the Darfur region. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2650.08s)]
*  On top of that, Ben, the Sudanese government declared that the head of the UN mission in Sudan [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2655.7599999999998s)]
*  was Persona Nangrada, so they're basically booting the guy out of the country. The latest stats are [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2660.24s)]
*  about one and a half million Sudanese people have been internally displaced in the country. Another [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2666.0s)]
*  half million have been forced to leave the country. Half the country of Sudan needs humanitarian [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2669.92s)]
*  assistance. So Ben, this is the worst nightmare scenario. I'm starting to see calls for the UN [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2675.6s)]
*  to deploy peacekeepers to Sudan. Previously, there was a joint UN-African Union peacekeeping [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2683.28s)]
*  mission. That mission ended in 2020. Do you think that's the right move? And if so, how quickly can [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2688.96s)]
*  something like that happen? Well, I mean, first of all, we're seeing, as you said, the worst case [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2694.96s)]
*  scenario play out because what happens is you have two warlord-type figures that decide to fight [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2699.52s)]
*  for control of the country. That can very quickly become zero-sum, as we've talked about, because [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2705.6000000000004s)]
*  whoever loses is, that's it. They're out. They'll probably be killed or they're certainly never [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2711.6s)]
*  going to be anywhere near power. And so then as it becomes zero-sum, these guys need every advantage [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2717.76s)]
*  they can get. So then they start stoking ethnic tensions and factional tensions and regional [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2723.6s)]
*  tensions because it serves their purposes. They clearly don't care how many people get killed. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2730.8s)]
*  And so you have this kind of spiral where what starts as a power struggle, [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2736.24s)]
*  they go around lighting every brush fire that they can to their advantage and you get this kind of [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2740.64s)]
*  killing and violence. It's just horrific. I think the daunting challenge is the geopolitics are much [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2746.7999999999997s)]
*  worse today than they were in the past when peacekeeping missions were authorized. The UN [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2755.04s)]
*  is a shell of itself because the UN Security Council is totally paralyzed by the geopolitical [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2762.56s)]
*  competition between the US and Russia and China. So getting a UN Security Council resolution around [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2767.68s)]
*  anything of any consequence is incredibly complicated. And that would normally be the [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2772.7999999999997s)]
*  umbrella for something like a peacekeeping mission or some peace deal. The African Union as the chief [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2777.44s)]
*  regional entity, you'd want to be playing a lead role, but it doesn't have the same clout that the [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2784.0s)]
*  UN Security Council once did and what countries are going to put peacekeepers in the middle of a [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2791.84s)]
*  civil war like that. And so I think, yeah, ideally you'd want some UN backed peace process for [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2797.1200000000003s)]
*  dialogue and ceasefire coupled with the deployment of some peacekeepers. But man, there's a lot [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2804.6400000000003s)]
*  working against that right now. I think that's a long shot. Yeah, I do too. And look, these are [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2810.32s)]
*  enormous places that these peacekeepers would have to cover. You've got to send a lot of people. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2814.4s)]
*  And to your point about the geopolitics, I mean, we know that the Russians, the Wagner group is [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2819.2000000000003s)]
*  probably benefiting from some of this instability, extracting more minerals and things from various [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2823.6s)]
*  countries. So yeah, it's just, it's dire. Switching gears here, Ben, there was an interesting report [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2828.2400000000002s)]
*  in the Wall Street Journal about how North Korean hackers have managed to steal more than $3 billion [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2833.44s)]
*  worth of cryptocurrency in the past five years. And they are using it to fund about half of North [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2841.6800000000003s)]
*  Korea's ballistic missile program. Wonderful. Just the solution we were looking for from [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2847.28s)]
*  cryptocurrency. So the first major crypto heists by the North Korean started in 2018. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2852.4s)]
*  There were more than 42 successful attacks identified in 2022, according to the James [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2857.76s)]
*  Martin Center for nonproliferation studies. North Korea has long been known to have a surprisingly [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2862.4s)]
*  strong sort of cyber force. I say surprising because it's, you know, I don't think you think [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2868.7200000000003s)]
*  of them as the most online culture out there or necessarily educated, but they have, North Korea [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2873.68s)]
*  has workers in countries all over the world. Many of them apply for jobs at like crypto companies. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2879.6s)]
*  They get hired and then they set up a back door for future access or otherwise cause mischief. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2886.64s)]
*  There was the, they, a bunch of North Korean hackers infected a bunch of hospitals with ransomware a [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2892.08s)]
*  couple of years ago. So these activities have become a critical lifeline for North Korea to [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2897.68s)]
*  get around sanctions. And experts say they have basically shifted most of their cyber operations [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2902.72s)]
*  from traditional espionage to theft. So I don't know. I don't want to, am I being too hard on [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2908.56s)]
*  cryptocurrency here by blaming them? It's North Korean stealing the stuff, but [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2914.56s)]
*  man, did it make it easier it seems. Well, if you set up, and I know the crypto [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2918.16s)]
*  enthusiasts will not like this, but like if you set up a whole kind of currency mechanism, whose [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2922.8799999999997s)]
*  chief attribute in your view is that it can evade government regulation, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2928.72s)]
*  guess who's going to move into that space pretty rapidly. Like what's interesting about North Korea [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2935.7599999999998s)]
*  is they've kind of established themselves as like the bottom feeders around global capitalism. So [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2940.3199999999997s)]
*  they have a cyber theft capability where they've essentially trained a bunch of hackers who've [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2946.3999999999996s)]
*  like either through ransom attacks or just outright theft have created a source of revenue. Now they're [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2952.48s)]
*  getting in the crypto space. By the way, we should add, this is like a very close first cousin of [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2957.2s)]
*  RFK and that whole set of people, the same people that have theories about the Ukrainian war are [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2962.56s)]
*  often crypto enthusiasts. That's not all crypto. There's some great people in crypto. I'd want to [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2971.68s)]
*  check. Dorsey changed the name of his company to block blockchain. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2976.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. So there's that too. But I mean, the whole point here is that like, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2980.64s)]
*  I really do think for even the kind of better intentioned, more earnest crypto investors, [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2984.24s)]
*  the idea that you're going to have a completely unregulated currency system, [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2989.9199999999996s)]
*  the big countries that don't like that, like the United States and China for that matter, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2994.08s)]
*  are going to start building up walls and start prosecuting people as we've seen with [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=2998.8799999999997s)]
*  FDX. And the North Koreas of the world are going to be, or the guy in El Salvador, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3002.64s)]
*  Bukele, who's building Bitcoin cities, those are going to be the people that [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3008.88s)]
*  rush into this space. And again, I think the interesting thing about the North Koreans is [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3014.0s)]
*  they don't need, because they don't care about their own people, a ton of money. They need [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3018.1600000000003s)]
*  a few billion dollars to sustain nuclear and ballistic missile stuff. And they're finding [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3022.96s)]
*  ways to do that by exploiting these kind of new unregulated kind of wild west slash tech. I'd look [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3027.76s)]
*  for what North Korea is going to do with AI, for instance, because AI is a shortcut to having a [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3035.2s)]
*  lot of capabilities. Their capacity is to kind of hang out and surf the next wave. First it was [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3041.6s)]
*  crypto, then it'll be AI next year. I think this is going to be part of their model. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3048.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's not great. Ben, Henry Kissinger might still be alive. We can celebrate him while he's [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3053.68s)]
*  living. But Silvio Berlusconi, the former prime minister of Italy, is now dead at 86. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3060.48s)]
*  He's probably the foreign leader who most resembles Trump. He's sort of like Trump before Trump. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3066.48s)]
*  Unlike Trump, he was a self-made mogul. Actually successful mogul. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3073.6s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, he set up like, he figured out TV early. He made massive amounts of money setting [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3076.96s)]
*  up all the TV stations and a bunch of, he had a media empire. He was crass, he was corrupt. He [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3081.12s)]
*  used to host sex parties with prostitutes called bunga bunga parties. He was later accused of [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3086.0s)]
*  having sex with an underage prostitute, although he was acquitted on those charges. He was convicted [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3091.84s)]
*  of tax fraud in 2012. But despite all these controversies and scandals, Berlusconi was [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3096.48s)]
*  prime minister four different times and a dominant figure in Italian politics for several decades. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3102.32s)]
*  His politics were kind of center right to right wing. He dabbled a lot with right wing populism. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3107.68s)]
*  He was more of a cult to personality than anything else. His buddies with Putin, [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3113.76s)]
*  he was recently caught on tape blaming Ukraine for the Russian invasion. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3117.2000000000003s)]
*  I think that here at Times, one of the stories about him described his brand of politics as [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3122.1600000000003s)]
*  populist buffoonery, which I thought was pretty perfect. He was incompetent when it came to [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3126.0s)]
*  economic management. Ben, I think in summary, here's what your take is on his legacy. He was [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3132.2400000000002s)]
*  certainly a close US ally in all our biggest mistakes, like the Iraq war, Libya, some might [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3138.32s)]
*  say, right wing populist, a real scumbag, but also just a towering towering figure in Italian politics. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3145.2000000000003s)]
*  First of all, his political resilience and success is helped a lot by the fact that he owned all [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3153.6000000000004s)]
*  these television stations. People ask, because he often ran the Italian economy in the ground, [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3160.0s)]
*  and he obviously had these personal scandals, but when you own the TV stations, it'd be almost [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3165.04s)]
*  as if Rupert Murdoch was also a politician or something. That's the degree of how much he could [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3169.36s)]
*  rely on a mouthpiece for the last 20 years. That to me explains his resilience, but in a way, [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3176.0s)]
*  you're right, he's an innovator. He anticipated Trump. He was a showman. He attracted attention [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3182.96s)]
*  to himself. He had no shame. He was ahead of the curve of what people like Trump figured out or [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3188.4s)]
*  Boris Johnson that if you do not have the capacity to be shamed, you can get away with [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3194.64s)]
*  stuff because you don't have to apologize and resign because you don't give a shit. That's one [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3200.8799999999997s)]
*  thing. I am struck by the US centric view of Berlusconi. I remember my consciousness of him [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3205.52s)]
*  started around the Iraq war because he was all in with Bush. Do you remember that debate when [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3212.24s)]
*  John Kerry criticized the war and said the US is going it alone and Bush started yelling, [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3218.72s)]
*  tell that to Silvio Berlusconi? Remember that? Well, it's the same thing. He was like, [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3223.28s)]
*  you forgot about Poland because France and Germany had obviously broken the US and Berlusconi stood [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3226.88s)]
*  by our side. It just goes to show that Bush, we don't drag Bush enough sometimes because remember [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3233.36s)]
*  he was looking into Putin's soul and he was buddy of Berlusconi. My memory of Berlusconi that stands [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3241.1200000000003s)]
*  out is, Tommy, were you at the G20 in Cannes and France in 2012, I believe? Yes. So at that, [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3246.72s)]
*  that's at the height of what was the Eurozone crisis, which was essentially Greece was defaulting, [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3256.08s)]
*  the Italian economy was falling, Greece down a rabbit hole. There was a concern that Italy [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3262.9599999999996s)]
*  and Greece were going to literally drag all of Europe into some massive financial crisis and [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3269.04s)]
*  another recession, which would have been existential to the Obama presidency as well. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3273.04s)]
*  What was clear in all the meetings that the leaders were having, like Merkel and Obama and [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3278.64s)]
*  all these people, Sarkozy, is that there was no solution to this problem unless Silvio Berlusconi [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3283.36s)]
*  resigned as Italian Prime Minister because he was so incompetent and gave so little of a shit of [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3288.8s)]
*  making a deal to rescue the Italian economy that you just couldn't do anything. There was this [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3293.92s)]
*  massive peer pressure from within Italy and from within Europe to be like, [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3299.12s)]
*  just step aside and let some technocrat in. And he did actually. He finally was like, okay, fine, [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3304.0s)]
*  I'll let some technocrat take over, stabilize the European economy. Then he came back. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3308.88s)]
*  So he was this weird, flexible guy in a way because usually if a bunch of people are like, [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3314.0s)]
*  yeah, you need to resign, you'd fight. But I think Berlusconi knew that he always could come back [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3318.32s)]
*  because of these TV stations. So I just remember watching him, everybody in the room was pissed [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3322.64s)]
*  at him, the entire G20 is like, you are the obstacle to solving this fucking problem. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3328.96s)]
*  And he just didn't seem to care that much. Just having a good time. Yeah, just hanging out. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3333.6s)]
*  It was in Cannes. So can you imagine what kind of parties he was going to while [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3337.52s)]
*  Angela Merkel and Obama are designing a bailout package? Yeah, making spreadsheets. Was that the [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3340.7200000000003s)]
*  one where we stayed up literally all night long drinking with some Brits the night before and [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3346.16s)]
*  halfway through the night, we realized they were all like MI5 and MI6. And then I basically went [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3351.44s)]
*  from the bar to the bus to fly to the next event. That was not the only time that probably happened. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3356.08s)]
*  That was Doviel. That was a G7 or G8. I think I got my G's wrong. Yeah, that was another G. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3367.04s)]
*  And let's just say I remember having to fly to that one and attend a meeting with Dmitry Medvedev [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3372.72s)]
*  during which I had the worst hangover I had. And I remember looking across at Lavrov and all the [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3380.56s)]
*  Russians had the same hangover. Like everyone was sweating bullets in this room. It was too hot. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3385.68s)]
*  And I was like, I'm going to have to run out of this room. And I look at Lavrov and I'm like, [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3391.68s)]
*  I think he's feeling the same way I am. Who's that guy? Full of shame and drinks from the night [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3395.9199999999996s)]
*  before. All right, a couple of quicker things to close. In Senegal, violent clashes between [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3401.04s)]
*  police and supporters of a leading opposition figure named Usmane Sonko have left at least [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3406.3999999999996s)]
*  23 people dead and 390 people injured according to MNC International. Senegal is known as one of [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3411.44s)]
*  Africa's most stable democracies, but there have been major protests since Sonko was sentenced to [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3417.68s)]
*  two years in prison earlier this month, which will bar him from running in future elections. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3423.2000000000003s)]
*  He was actually facing much more serious charges, specifically rape, but he was not convicted there. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3428.64s)]
*  Many people are furious at President Macysel for the brutal police response to the protesters. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3435.76s)]
*  That includes firing live ammo. People are just getting killed indiscriminately. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3441.68s)]
*  They're also mad at him about high unemployment and corruption. Human rights groups are also [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3446.0s)]
*  concerned about a broader erosion of democratic norms in Senegal, including the arrest of journalists [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3450.32s)]
*  and opposition politicians. So not good. Yeah, Macysel, what's interesting is Macysel came into [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3456.08s)]
*  power as like the democracy candidate backed by civil society who is denying like someone with [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3462.64s)]
*  autocratic tendencies from sticking around. He's got a choice to make. There's a about whether to [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3470.56s)]
*  be one of these guys who tries to extend his time in office or whether to back a successor. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3479.84s)]
*  Look, you can never measure places against the perfect, but I think the important point here is [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3485.36s)]
*  that Senegal has an election upcoming and it has been, along with Ghana, like a mainstay of some [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3490.96s)]
*  semblance of democracy and stability in West Africa, this is the same region where we've seen [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3497.44s)]
*  coups in places like Burkina Faso and Mali. And so you really hope that that stability holds and [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3505.36s)]
*  they get through this election in a democratic way. And so this is something to watch because [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3513.76s)]
*  it does have an impact, not just on Senegal, but like on this wider region that had been one of the [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3519.04s)]
*  bright spots in terms of democracy. You hate to see that go up in flames. So the Senegal election [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3525.52s)]
*  is one to watch here. Yeah, for sure. Also, we have talked many times on the show about the murder of [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3534.0s)]
*  a young woman named Massa Amini by the so-called morality police in Iran. Her murder led to this [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3539.2s)]
*  wave of anti-government protests, a brutal crackdown by the security forces in response. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3545.12s)]
*  It turns out now Iran is prosecuting two women who simply reported on Massa Amini's story. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3550.32s)]
*  Nulufar Hamidi and Elahe Mohammadi are journalists. They have spent eight months in prison [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3556.6400000000003s)]
*  before going on trial last week. They were charged with conspiring with foreign intelligence agencies [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3563.52s)]
*  to undermine national security. Those accusations are self-evidently ridiculous, but if convicted, [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3568.96s)]
*  their punishments could be death. There has been a surge of executions in Iran lately. The Wall [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3575.04s)]
*  Street Journal reported that at least 142 people were executed in May alone, the highest monthly [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3580.56s)]
*  number since 2015. About half of those are drug charges, but a lot of them are protesters and [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3587.36s)]
*  people who are just sort of expressing frustration with the government. So awful story, Ben. I'm [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3593.68s)]
*  hoping that some more attention on this will lead to some sort of international diplomatic effort [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3598.0s)]
*  to pressure Iran to release them, to at least not use capital punishment. I mean, something to walk [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3602.56s)]
*  this back. Yeah, no, it's horrific. And the challenge is that we've seen in the aftermath [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3608.72s)]
*  of the breakdown of the Iran nuclear agreement, but then also the obviously most acutely in the [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3614.64s)]
*  aftermath of these protests in the war in Ukraine, as the Iranians kind of just go all in with Russia, [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3620.16s)]
*  their capacity to be influenced by... The US has always had some limited capacity, but Europe [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3630.2400000000002s)]
*  was a voice that Iran sometimes listened to. It's just harder and harder to affect Iranian behavior. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3636.96s)]
*  And there's clearly this kind of zero-sum crackdown that's happening in Iran. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3645.04s)]
*  I think part of what's lurking in the backdrop too is that, and there have been some reporting [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3650.7200000000003s)]
*  about this recently, the Supreme Leader is old, very old. He's been in poor health. So there's [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3654.24s)]
*  succession issues looming on the horizon. The capacity for Iran to be a very volatile place [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3660.24s)]
*  continues to be acute. You would hope that in the interim though, that international tension, [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3666.72s)]
*  international spotlight can at least try to curb some of these excesses and protect some of these [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3672.08s)]
*  journalists. There's no what aboutism in the world that could ever justify what's happening. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3677.6s)]
*  So the point I'm about to make is not at all to let Iran off the hook. It would be nice if the US [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3688.08s)]
*  opposed the killing of journalists as a general matter in the Middle East. And that's harder [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3695.52s)]
*  when the Saudis are buying up professional golf and hanging out with us after they killed the [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3703.52s)]
*  journalists. So it'd be good to have that moral authority too. Yeah, that's a fair point. Yeah, [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3711.44s)]
*  not great. Not great that Mohammed bin Salman is welcomed back into the fold after that. Although [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3717.52s)]
*  the Saudis also leading the charge when it comes to executions globally. So another great thing. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3722.48s)]
*  Yeah, we're in that club too, the US. I mean, it's an argument against the death penalty here, [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3727.04s)]
*  not that we have to go down that road that the other countries that utilize it are good [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3732.08s)]
*  advertisement for not doing that. I could not be more opposed to the death penalty. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3736.3199999999997s)]
*  Last thing before Ben's interview. Ben, Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber, died recently in his [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3740.48s)]
*  jail cell. Thoughts and prayers to all the Harvard grads out there. I know you lost a real one. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3747.68s)]
*  Did you know that he was subjected to the CIA backed MK Ultra experiments while at Harvard? [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3752.08s)]
*  No, is that true? I had no idea. I saw it mentioned in one of the obits I read that linked me to a [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3759.44s)]
*  really long Atlantic piece about him that said that there's an experiment where these subjects [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3766.08s)]
*  were put under essentially mock interrogations. They had like blinding spotlights. They were [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3774.08s)]
*  verbally abused and they just like shouted them down about their beliefs and harshly criticized [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3778.6400000000003s)]
*  them. There's no evidence that LSD or other substances were used on Ted Kaczynski that, [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3784.56s)]
*  for those who don't know MK Ultra, is this crazy CIA backed program of like the most famous piece [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3790.24s)]
*  of it was giving people LSD to see if you could get like truth serums or mind control or just like [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3794.7999999999997s)]
*  that shit crazy Cold War thinking. But yeah, the Unabomber was subject to MK Ultra backed [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3799.68s)]
*  experiments while at Harvard. Seems like that one didn't work out. I did go down like the obit rabbit [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3805.92s)]
*  hole with him and you know what's interesting is if you go back and look at I mean first of all, [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3813.2s)]
*  it's extraordinary that the New York Times and Washington Post like literally published this guy's [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3817.2799999999997s)]
*  like 30,000 word manifesto. Yeah, why did they do that? They did it because he said he wouldn't [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3820.96s)]
*  kill anybody anymore if they did and that's true and actually the irony of it is the publication [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3825.9199999999996s)]
*  of his manifesto is what tipped off his brother's read the manifesto. He's like, holy shit, I think [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3832.8799999999997s)]
*  that's my brother and that's how they got him. That's gotta be a tough phone call. But like the [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3837.8399999999997s)]
*  you know, like if you look at his ideology, right, it's kind of anti everything, anti tech, [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3843.52s)]
*  anti you know, like like today he'd be in like a Twitter space or something or he'd be in like a [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3849.2s)]
*  4chan or something like he he's actually like a very recognizable character today [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3854.96s)]
*  as this kind of anti world government, you know, but you know, he was a man tragically ahead of [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3860.3999999999996s)]
*  his times in some ways. Yeah, and there's so I guess there is a question of whether these [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3869.76s)]
*  experiments were done on him sort of aggravated what I think was later diagnosed as schizophrenia [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3873.36s)]
*  and that led to this behavior where he sent these package bombs, killed three people, injured 23 [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3878.4s)]
*  others and these completely random just heinous crimes against people. Yeah, horror, horrific and [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3883.1200000000003s)]
*  sometimes it's totally random people married with children. We should always like there was a bit of [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3888.48s)]
*  a like, I guess there's like a boom lid and like people that like look up to him and like, man, [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3893.6000000000004s)]
*  don't don't don't separate out the crime from what this guy was saying. You're also a fucking idiot if [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3899.44s)]
*  you think he was some sort of genius. No, it's what you said. It's like completely wrote like [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3904.72s)]
*  Twitter spaces. Yeah, it's like Twitter spaces ranting like, you know, in Unabomber form. Yeah. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3908.72s)]
*  Okay, that's it for us and for the Unabomber. We're going to take a quick break and we come back, [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3915.04s)]

*  cratered it killed Merlot, even though it wasn't actually about the quality of the wine. It was [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=3958.48s)]

*  the times of Boris Johnson's ascent and descent from his election to his resignation. As Prime [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4040.48s)]
*  Minister, we had to have you on here to discuss the most recent turn of events with Boris stepping [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4047.04s)]
*  down as a Member of Parliament and some chaos ensuing in the Conservative Party. Why don't we [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4055.44s)]
*  just start with what happened and what is your reaction? Well, your audience will know that [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4061.2s)]
*  Boris Johnson got himself into difficulties because of lies. And the big lies he told was he [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4068.08s)]
*  crafted the rules that governed our behavior during the pandemic, and then it turns out that [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4077.68s)]
*  he was partying with his staff in number 10. But the problem is in our parliament, there is a clear [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4083.4399999999996s)]
*  rule that you must not lie. Sometimes, accidentally, people speak, you know, they misspeak or there's [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4091.12s)]
*  an untruth. You correct the record very quickly. Boris Johnson did not do this. There was a catalog [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4098.48s)]
*  of events and things that he said in parliament that were problematic. So it was then investigated [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4106.0s)]
*  by a what we call a select committee. This is the Privileges Committee of Standards across Parliament [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4111.599999999999s)]
*  that look at these issues. It's a cross-party committee of parliamentarians. Actually, the [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4118.64s)]
*  majority of the committee are conservatives. It's chaired by a very eminent Labour MP, Harriet [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4125.4400000000005s)]
*  Harman. And they wrote to Boris Johnson to tell him where they were, where they had got to. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4133.4400000000005s)]
*  It was that that led to him effectively writing this, crafting this letter that knocked the [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4140.160000000001s)]
*  committee, called it a kangaroo court. And I think that's very interesting because I saw that [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4147.28s)]
*  language used by Donald Trump on exactly the same day in the United States of America. And also, [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4152.5599999999995s)]
*  attack Rishi Sunak. Why? Because Rishi Sunak, on the same day, Boris Johnson has a list of people [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4162.48s)]
*  that he can give honors to. You know, in the UK, you can put people in the House of Lords, [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4170.16s)]
*  or you can make them knights or dames. And it seems that Rishi Sunak knocked back some of those [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4174.8s)]
*  recommendations of Boris Johnson, or didn't do quite what Boris Johnson wanted him to do, [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4182.88s)]
*  even though the list was full of cronies and people who were associated with partying and [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4187.28s)]
*  some of the worst aspects of populism in this country. So it was a day in which he then ultimately [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4193.84s)]
*  resigned and two of his close colleagues who did not appear on that list but expected to, [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4201.12s)]
*  Nadine Doris and Nigel Adams also resigned. So we now have three by-election, and this is [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4206.88s)]
*  hugely undermining Rishi Sunak because he's likely to do very badly in those by-elections. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4213.2s)]
*  And the Labour Party are likely to do very well. Again, your listeners will have followed that we [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4219.2s)]
*  are doing very well in the polls here in the UK, and a lot of people are predicting that Labour [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4226.48s)]
*  is likely to return to government at the point at which there's the next general election. So [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4231.5199999999995s)]
*  that's a summary of what's gone on. And what is Boris's next play here? Does he have a path back [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4234.959999999999s)]
*  to power, or is he just a chaos agent? Is he just got a vendetta against Rishi Sunak? Like, what is [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4240.16s)]
*  he doing with this kind of performative resignation and trying to get his allies to step aside? [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4245.599999999999s)]
*  Is this part of a plan, or is this just him being Boris? Well, let's just deal with the [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4251.44s)]
*  fundamentals first, because let's just look at the populist playbook first. One, there's an [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4255.6s)]
*  undermining of the institution that is parliament. You know, it is actually serious when you have [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4261.280000000001s)]
*  lied, when a panel of your peers have looked into this. It's unprecedented in wrongdoing to undermine [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4267.360000000001s)]
*  a committee of the Parliament of the House of Commons. The cronyism, you know, favouring your [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4276.240000000001s)]
*  own in this way, and giving them honours and expecting the new prime minister to do your [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4282.16s)]
*  bidding is also deeply, deeply flawed and undemocratic, and is all about his judgement. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4286.639999999999s)]
*  What's his play? Well, his play is he wants to return as leader of the Conservative Party. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4294.4s)]
*  He expects that Rishi Sunak will not be successful in the next general election. He wants probably [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4300.96s)]
*  to get back into parliament, either in one of these seats. We'll see that in the next week play [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4308.0s)]
*  out, or a little bit later on, and to return as probably the leader of the opposition for the [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4313.12s)]
*  Conservative Party. You know, in a way, the opposition plays to him because he's got no [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4318.88s)]
*  responsibility, but then to lead the Conservative Party back to victory, it's a playbook that we see [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4323.04s)]
*  in other parts of the world. It's very, very dangerous, very, very worrying. You know, [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4332.4s)]
*  Americans might think he's a clown, but it's far more problematic than that. And the other thing [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4338.0s)]
*  that I think is a real issue are the enablers. The enablers in the Conservative Party that have [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4344.48s)]
*  allowed this to happen and still hold up this figure that's become so corrosive to British [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4350.0s)]
*  political life. And I say that, of course, I disagree on policy terms with my Conservative [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4357.44s)]
*  colleagues, but I have huge respect for the Conservative Party as a political force. It has [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4363.5199999999995s)]
*  been so depressing to see them moving to the far right, really, of the political agenda and taking [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4369.919999999999s)]
*  on this populist mantle. And I think that Boris Johnson is destroying a once great party, and [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4377.839999999999s)]
*  certainly the party of Margaret Thatcher, Macmillan, and others in the 20th century. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4382.56s)]
*  Yeah. No, it sounds like a similar play to what we've seen in the Republican Party here. We'll [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4387.76s)]
*  get to that in a second. But that's interesting. I mean, essentially, like maybe let Rishi Sunak [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4391.92s)]
*  take the L, as we'd say here in the United States, take the loss to labor, and then come back as a [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4397.360000000001s)]
*  leader. I do want to ask you, like you've got dominoes falling all around you, David. A friendlier [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4402.240000000001s)]
*  party in terms of ideology on some issues, obviously not all issues, has been the Scottish [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4409.44s)]
*  Nationalist Party, the SNP. We woke to the news that Nicola Sturgeon, the former leader, former [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4416.0s)]
*  guest on this podcast, was arrested in a payment scandal, a kind of corruption scandal. That doesn't [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4423.36s)]
*  necessarily mean she's going to be charged in the context of UK law, but what is going on in the SNP? [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4429.759999999999s)]
*  And for our listeners, labor often is sometimes competing for votes in Scotland with the SNP. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4437.04s)]
*  What does this mean for the SNP, and what does it mean for your strategy heading into an election [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4444.64s)]
*  where you have been competing with that party over the years for a working class vote in Scotland? [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4449.92s)]
*  Well, look, I mean, for too long, and your listeners may not have appreciated this, [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4455.44s)]
*  but there's been a culture of secrecy and cover-up that's been allowed to fester at the heart of the [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4461.04s)]
*  Scottish Nationalist Party, and I think this is now coming home to roost. And, you know, it's very [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4468.08s)]
*  sad to see the situation that Nicola Sturgeon and her husband find themselves in in relation to the [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4477.12s)]
*  finances of that party and loans made to that party and whether rules have been broken. Now, [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4486.4s)]
*  there's an ongoing police investigation, so I can't get into the weeds on that, except to say that [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4496.639999999999s)]
*  clearly it does present the British Labour Party with an opportunity in Scotland under our leadership [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4503.28s)]
*  of Anna Sarwar and a revival in Scotland, because it means that the debate now moves beyond just the [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4514.32s)]
*  question of independence. The Labour Party is a party that believes in the union, and people start [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4522.08s)]
*  to focus on public services in Scotland. They start to focus on the real issues. Hang on a minute, [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4528.88s)]
*  what are the SNP doing about cost of living? What are they doing about health? What are they doing [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4534.96s)]
*  about education? You know, are these guys in it for themselves? Are some of the questions that [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4540.88s)]
*  are being asked in Scotland, and that presents the Labour Party with an opportunity. Now, I don't want [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4546.24s)]
*  to say it's any more than an opportunity, because we have to be clear on our offer to the Scottish [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4551.84s)]
*  electorate, but you know, you do need a bit of luck sometimes in politics. You need fortune to [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4559.28s)]
*  come your way. I've looked at the polls more recently in Scotland, and it looks like the same [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4566.0s)]
*  revival that we're seeing here in England is being replicated in Scotland, and we could be on course [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4572.16s)]
*  to win between 12 and 20 seats, which would be a huge revival of our fortunes. And a lot of people [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4578.56s)]
*  said that it would be very hard for us to get over the line and walk into number 10 if we did not see [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4587.44s)]
*  votes pick up in Scotland. And we now have the opportunity for that to happen. And I think good [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4593.84s)]
*  leadership in Scotland means that things are looking brighter than they've looked for some time. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4601.68s)]
*  So one more British political question here, because part of what's interesting here is [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4606.72s)]
*  for people who've listened to this podcast for a while, like, you know, the SNP and the Tories are [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4610.72s)]
*  very different in a lot of ways. SNP has been more progressive on a bunch of issues. But [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4615.28s)]
*  one common thread you mentioned kind of potential political corruption, we should say, [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4619.68s)]
*  because it's not as if Boris Johnson didn't have some scandals around dark money payments and things [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4625.2s)]
*  like that. But also nationalism and populism, right? I mean, you know, SNP is fundamentally a [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4629.5199999999995s)]
*  nationalist movement, kind of a populist nationalist movement. So even though it's more on the [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4635.04s)]
*  left side of the equation, it has some of that DNA. You've called for a general election [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4641.76s)]
*  right away. Rishi Sunak is unlikely to do that. There will be an election no later than kind of [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4648.8s)]
*  the end of next year. We see Rishi Sunak, he was just in the US with President Biden, we see him [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4653.6s)]
*  really trying to present himself as this kind of technocratic statesman, you know, who's resolving, [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4659.68s)]
*  making agreements, and he's hosting summits on AI, and he's, you know, hugging Zelensky. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4664.64s)]
*  What do you guys need to do to close the deal here over the next year to take that contrast that you [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4671.04s)]
*  already have on nationalism and populism and corruption and turn it into like a governing [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4676.24s)]
*  majority? Well, let me just take the first point, and this is to say that we are up against as [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4681.04s)]
*  progressives, the politics of division, the nativism of populism, often playing to the worst [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4687.12s)]
*  instincts of humanity that divide us, don't bring us together. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4698.96s)]
*  What I see in Joe Biden when I look from across the Atlantic is an attempt to bring a nation together [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4703.2s)]
*  in hugely divisive times, and I hope that the Labour Party presents that opportunity as well. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4712.5599999999995s)]
*  What do we have to do? Well, you know, we have to answer the vision question. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4720.4s)]
*  In British politics, what can happen when a political party comes out too early with its [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4725.679999999999s)]
*  its policy operates manifesto is that you're a political opponents if they're clever, steal [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4730.48s)]
*  some of your clothes. So we're now going into the cycle where we lay that out very clearly, [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4735.2s)]
*  certainly by the time we get to our conference season, which is a bit like a convention, [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4740.96s)]
*  and we'll have that in October of this year, so that the country is very clear on what Labour's [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4747.5199999999995s)]
*  offer is. And that's for us, it's key domestic issues. What are we saying about inflation and [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4753.84s)]
*  cost of living? Inflation here is running at 8.7%. What are we saying about public services? Key [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4760.639999999999s)]
*  there is health and education. Childcare is a very big issue on the doorstep here in the UK. We have [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4768.88s)]
*  to have a good offer on childcare, particularly. And crime, crime is rising. There is concern about [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4775.52s)]
*  antisocial behaviour in neighbourhoods. We also have to be very clear in those key domestic [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4783.76s)]
*  portfolio areas. And then by the election, people, you know, it's almost like that pledge card, [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4790.0s)]
*  people have got to know the four or five things that you were saying. Keir Starmer, no one thought, [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4796.96s)]
*  frankly, after the loss in 2019, the worst defeat for the Labour Party since 1935, [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4804.0s)]
*  no one thought three years later that we would be in this position. So credit to Keir Starmer [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4810.96s)]
*  for getting us into this. I mean, I cautioned Keir Starmer that maybe we should have a 10-year [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4817.76s)]
*  plan because, you know, five years was pretty ambitious. But he has got us back into the game [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4822.24s)]
*  and now we've just got to seal the deal. Yeah. No, I remember you came on after that [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4829.12s)]
*  victory and you said, you know, hopefully you can be done in five years, but it might be 10. But [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4833.68s)]
*  it seems like the timetables may be moving fast. Well, one more question for you, David, [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4838.16s)]
*  since the theme of this podcast interview seems to be crimes, misdemeanours and lies. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4842.88s)]
*  Donald Trump is, you know, presenting himself in a Miami courthouse as we speak, not to diminish [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4849.92s)]
*  the New York indictment, but this is kind of a far more serious charge because it touches on national [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4856.4s)]
*  security. We know from the indictment it touches on the Iranian war plan. What is the view of this [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4861.52s)]
*  latest turn in Donald Trump's and American politics from abroad? Because on the one hand, [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4870.72s)]
*  I could see, well, this is justice working and this shows that there's still like a legal system [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4875.84s)]
*  in the US that can take on someone with the political power of Trump. But also, it also could [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4881.68s)]
*  be seen as kind of the chaos of American politics, the strangeness of it, Trump's kind of resilience, [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4886.88s)]
*  that he's still the Republican front runner despite this. And frankly, the national security [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4892.24s)]
*  concern of like, hey, can we trust the United States with our secrets? I mean, one of the [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4896.8s)]
*  documents that was reported in the indictment was shareable only with the UK and New Zealand and [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4900.32s)]
*  Australia. So you guys are in on this. How does this look from London? Let me just say, and, you [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4905.28s)]
*  know, I was in the Indo-Pacific just a couple of weeks ago. I was in Singapore for the Shangri-La [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4911.84s)]
*  conference. All of the globe is looking carefully at what's happening in the United States. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4920.64s)]
*  We worry about a different political view is part of a healthy democracy, but [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4928.24s)]
*  huge deep divides, I think, are very problematic. I think if the United States were to move into an [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4936.400000000001s)]
*  isolationist position where it is hostile to NATO, and we did see that before under the Donald Trump [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4943.12s)]
*  presidency, where the debates are so internal that it sort of departs almost from the international [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4952.08s)]
*  stage, I think that that is incredibly dangerous. And we have huge geopolitical forces that could [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4960.08s)]
*  capitalize on that. And I'm thinking of Russia, Iran, China. I'm thinking of what Putin's thinking [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4966.24s)]
*  at this time as he looks closely at what's happening in the United States. Obviously, [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4972.72s)]
*  I'm in the, you know, I'm shadow foreign secretary. And I think that's a very, very [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4978.8s)]
*  important point. I'm in the, you know, I'm shadow foreign secretary. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4985.2s)]
*  The Britain has a historic special relationship with the United States where part of the five [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4990.8s)]
*  eyes intelligence system, some of the best intelligence capability in the world, sensitive [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=4996.5599999999995s)]
*  documents, you know, put good people in harm's way and must never ever fall into the hands of [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=5002.48s)]
*  those who would do us harm. So the issues here are not knock around issues. These are very, [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=5013.28s)]
*  very serious issues indeed. And we will follow very closely what happens. As you know, [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=5019.759999999999s)]
*  that the relationship that we have with the USA really goes way beyond who is in the White House [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=5026.639999999999s)]
*  because of, you know, how close really our military and our intelligence particularly [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=5034.8s)]
*  and our historic cultural ties. But the world is in a very, very challenging geopolitical moment. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=5042.8s)]
*  And we need calm heads. And it's been worrying to watch the extremes [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=5050.96s)]
*  of political flavor really enter the US political scene. And, you know, and I, [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=5062.4s)]
*  you know, the justice stuff has to play out and I can't comment on how the justice system [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=5070.799999999999s)]
*  moves forward in the United States. But I can see that there's quite a lot of rancor [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=5075.36s)]
*  in America. And that does worry me because I'm, you know, I love the United States of America. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=5081.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. No, it's well said. I mean, you, if you guys get in, presumably next year, [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=5087.92s)]
*  you will have a five year window dealing with, as you and I have talked about, kind of offline, [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=5093.04s)]
*  you know, Ukraine, China, AI, all these issues. I'll say it, you don't have to say it. It'll be [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=5097.76s)]
*  easier for you to deal with those issues if we have a kind of rational competent administration. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=5105.28s)]
*  But look, David, it's been great talking to you. Maybe we'll check in with you after the [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=5111.6s)]
*  around the party conference to see your part of that agenda and continue to, you know, be very [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=5114.88s)]
*  impressed by how you guys have positioned labor heading into an election year. So [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=5122.32s)]
*  thanks for coming on. Thank you so much. And we should just say, despite the doom and gloom, [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=5125.92s)]
*  both of these stories do also remind us that, yes, there are some populist tides in both of our [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=5131.76s)]
*  countries, but there are also hugely important democratic checks and balances. And that's what [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=5137.52s)]
*  I always remind people who are looking at these issues from afar. Keep an eye on the checks and [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=5145.120000000001s)]
*  balances that exist because in the end, you know, that's what the people in Ukraine are fighting [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=5150.080000000001s)]
*  for, to have that kind of deep democracy. And I know that the United States is still writing [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=5157.68s)]
*  that story and we too in the UK are doing the same thing. Yeah, no, it's good. It's a great [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=5163.28s)]
*  point because these types of leaders in countries without those checks and balances, it'd be a little [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=5167.92s)]
*  more complicated. So it's a good good note to end on. All right. Thanks, David. Good to see you. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=5175.04s)]
*  Great. Thanks a lot, Ben. Thanks again to David Lamey for joining the show. Thanks again to Boris [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=5179.5199999999995s)]
*  Johnson for resigning. Yeah, I wish we had some champagne. I was sitting in the studio with you. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=5183.92s)]
*  We did pour one out for him. But I mean, you know, he's Trump, Boris, like we're working [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=5188.96s)]
*  through them. We've got some other ones that Sylvia. Yes, Sylvia. Like I. Yeah, thanks to [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=5193.68s)]
*  Hillary Clinton for like a penetrating insight about. Yeah, there we go. All right. Talk to [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=5200.56s)]
*  us this week. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgTNEOHyecg&t=5206.16s)]
