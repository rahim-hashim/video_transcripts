Video Description: This week on Pod Save The World, Tommy Vietor and Ben Rhodes talk about negative headlines surrounding Ukraine’s counteroffensive, Russian warlord Yevgeny Prigozhin’s re-emergence in Africa, a Human Rights Watch Report about Saudi Arabia’s horrendous abuse of Ethiopian migrants, a fun twist in the Mar-a-Lago documents case, and rare good news for climate change from voters rejecting oil drilling in Ecuador and a drop in deforestation in Brazil. They also discuss Canada’s unprecedented wildfires, Ecuador’s election runoff a week after the assassination of a presidential candidate, the rise of a far-right political party in Germany, GOP candidate Vivek Ramaswamy’s remarks on America’s commitment to Israel, and the crash of a Russian lunar probe. Then Tommy is joined by Kurt Campbell, President Biden’s Coordinator for Indo-Pacific Affairs, to break down the historic summit at Camp David the US hosted between Japan and South Korea’s leaders.

# Justin Trudeau Hammers Meta/Facebook for Blocking Canadian Wildfire News
**Pod Save the World:** [August 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA)
*  Welcome back to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Ben Rhodes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=0.0s)]
*  Ben, how many times have you watched the new Hard Knock season with the Jets? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3.04s)]
*  It's making me like Aaron Rodgers and I don't like that feeling. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=8.24s)]
*  It's been kind of strange, hasn't it? Yeah. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Because I'd written the guy off as a kind of red-pilled Joe Rogan. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=12.72s)]
*  Kind of a dickhead. Yeah, but, you know, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=18.16s)]
*  he's kind of likeable and he can still throw the ball. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=21.52s)]
*  We'll see if I still like him, you know, week three of the season. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=23.92s)]
*  Week eight. Yeah. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=26.48s)]
*  Also, Sauce Gardener is just a cornerback. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=27.84s)]
*  Yeah. Now, the problem is we've had previous [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  seasons where the Jets looked really good coming out of Hard Knocks. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=33.44s)]
*  And then let's just say the momentum kind of dissipated around week three. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=36.400000000000006s)]
*  Yeah. We'll see. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=41.68s)]
*  Well, we will try not to butt-fumble on the show today. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=42.64s)]
*  I think that was a Hard Knock season. That was a Hard Knock season. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=46.64s)]
*  We're going to talk about fears that Ukraine's counteroffensive [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=50.0s)]
*  has stalled amidst a new funding request to Congress from the Biden administration. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=52.56s)]
*  This horrifying report by Human Rights Watch about [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=57.12s)]
*  Saudi Arabia's treatment of Ethiopian migrants. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  Some bad news for Trump in the Mar-a-Lago documents case. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=62.0s)]
*  Good news about climate change and then some scary climate change news out of Canada [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=65.12s)]
*  where they're dealing with these horrific, massive wildfires. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=68.56s)]
*  Get an election in Ecuador, the far right in Germany, and then a little more flavor [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=71.92s)]
*  from our friend Vivek Ramaswamy, the Republican candidate for president, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=76.8s)]
*  who's saying, you know, look, to his credit, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=79.92s)]
*  he's saying different and interesting things about foreign policy. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=82.16s)]
*  I mean, it's great for a weekly segment. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=85.12s)]
*  It's great for content. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=89.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=89.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=89.68s)]
*  We'll start with- [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=90.08s)]
*  The Vakes takes. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=90.48s)]
*  Vakes takes? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=91.44s)]
*  I like that. Space, dining and dashing and more. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=92.08s)]
*  And then I just spoke with President Biden's top Asia hand, Kurt Campbell. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=95.52000000000001s)]
*  We talked about the historic summit at Camp David last weekend with, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=100.16000000000001s)]
*  last Friday, with the presidents of South Korea and Japan. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  We also talked about China, China's economy, how China might view, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=106.88000000000001s)]
*  you know, sort of the US building up defensive alliances in the region. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=111.76s)]
*  We talked about North Korea and the threat from its nuclear program was a lot of fun. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=115.68s)]
*  Actually. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=119.68s)]
*  Yeah. Kurt is definitely the, you know, the center of things on Asia policy [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=120.0s)]
*  and just a huge personality, good guy. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=125.04s)]
*  Can we call him a czar? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  He's a czar. He's the Asia czar. He's the Indo-Pacific coordinator, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=128.16s)]
*  which I think whenever the word coordinator is in your title, that's czar. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=131.20000000000002s)]
*  That makes you a bigger deal. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=134.72s)]
*  That's code for czar. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=135.28s)]
*  He's not just your run-of-the-mill senior director here. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=137.20000000000002s)]
*  He's a BFD. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=139.36s)]
*  He's a czar. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=140.0s)]
*  Also just like a very funny guy who can tell a great story. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  But I digress, Ben. Let's start with Ukraine. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  Because you and I both noticed there's a bunch of reporting over the weekend or last couple days [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=146.4s)]
*  that was very similar about how the Ukrainian offensive is struggling. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  We both kind of wondered, like, was there a briefing? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=154.32000000000002s)]
*  Like, what's going on here? Why are these all popping at the same time? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=156.08s)]
*  Here's a few examples. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=159.44s)]
*  The Financial Times, quote, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  US officials are increasingly critical of Ukraine's counteroffensive strategy [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=162.4s)]
*  and gloomy about its prospects of success. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=165.84s)]
*  Wall Street Journal, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=168.16s)]
*  Russia's war on Ukraine is in danger of becoming a protracted struggle that lasts several more years. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=169.12s)]
*  The Washington Post, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=173.44s)]
*  Ukraine appears to be running out of options in a counteroffensive [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=174.24s)]
*  that officials originally framed as Kiev's crucial operation to retake significant territory. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=176.56s)]
*  The Post, again, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=182.16s)]
*  US intelligence community assesses that Ukraine's counteroffensive will fail to reach the key [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=183.04s)]
*  southeastern city of Melotopol. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=186.72s)]
*  Blah, blah, blah. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=189.6s)]
*  You get the point. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=190.56s)]
*  We're not trying to be downers here. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=192.24s)]
*  And like, obviously, like, the military situation can change quickly. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=193.84s)]
*  We saw that last year in that offensive. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=196.56s)]
*  But I do think the coverage in Washington is relevant, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=199.12s)]
*  given that President Biden is asking for another $24 billion to arm Ukraine. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=202.8s)]
*  That funding request is tucked into a broader funding package that includes [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=207.6s)]
*  disaster relief, border security, I think anti-drug stuff for fentanyl. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  So hopefully that makes the politics of voting against it harder. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=216.96s)]
*  But Ben, I'm increasingly nervous about what Kevin McCarthy [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=219.84s)]
*  can or will be able to do when it comes to getting this passed. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  Ben Felsenfeld Yeah, I mean, first of all, I don't think [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=226.56s)]
*  we should be that surprised that this has been a hard fight. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=229.44000000000003s)]
*  We've talked a lot about how the Russians are dug in, how this is a bit of a war of attrition. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=232.0s)]
*  Frankly, from the get-go, you would think that this might be a multi-year war, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=236.96s)]
*  not something that wraps into years. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=241.44000000000003s)]
*  I think the headline coming out of those stories, though, to me is [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=243.04000000000002s)]
*  a sense that the US is in a different place than the Ukrainians. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  The subtext of the stories was not just that the Ukrainians are having trouble, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=251.11999999999998s)]
*  it's that there's some disagreement on tactics and strategy between the Ukrainians and the Americans. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=255.67999999999998s)]
*  They really kind of boiled down to a couple things. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=262.08s)]
*  One thing that's been reported a lot in the last few weeks is that the Ukrainians tried out the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  kind of new US and NATO-trained approach to combined arms, and that's like trying to [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=268.4s)]
*  merge capabilities. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=274.8s)]
*  The Ukrainians would like more air capabilities, but tanks and something, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=276.88s)]
*  long-range artillery and infantry capabilities. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=280.64s)]
*  Instead, after suffering a lot of losses doing that and not making a lot of territorial gains, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=284.32s)]
*  they've reverted back to a grinded out artillery struggle, and that the US would like to see them [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=289.6s)]
*  make better use of all the weapons we're providing through these different tactics. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=295.04s)]
*  Put that aside because that's like the military experts can nerd out on that. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=299.36s)]
*  The more fundamental thing that I saw in some of this reporting was the US really wanting them to [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=304.0s)]
*  focus on just breaking this land bridge. The idea is that the Ukrainians are spread too wide, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=309.52s)]
*  they're fighting on too many fronts. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=315.44s)]
*  Too many guys in Bakhmut. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=316.88s)]
*  Yeah, this kind of comes out of the Bakhmut criticism. Why are you fighting in the Donbas [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=318.0s)]
*  in eastern Ukraine? You really have to focus on the south because if you can kind of break [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=321.44s)]
*  the connection between Crimea and eastern Ukraine, the parts of Russia controls, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=325.2s)]
*  that's what the US really wants to keep Ukraine as a viable state. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=329.59999999999997s)]
*  The Ukrainians want to take back all their territory. To me, this is really important [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=333.68s)]
*  because I don't think that the Biden administration believes that they wouldn't say this, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=339.12s)]
*  but that it's feasible in the near term that they're going to take back Crimea, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=345.28s)]
*  they're going to take back every inch of eastern Ukraine. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=348.47999999999996s)]
*  They would want Ukraine to throw everything at just kind of that, breaking that land bridge. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  That's a fundamental disconnect. I think if you see the bad headlines, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=354.79999999999995s)]
*  yes, that could lead to fatigue in Congress, that could be a rationale for people, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=359.59999999999997s)]
*  and you already hear on the right people saying, why are we pouring weapons into this [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=362.8s)]
*  counter-offensive that's not making progress? But also it could create tensions between [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=366.48s)]
*  Washington and Kiev, where if you see more grumbling like this from American officials, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=370.24s)]
*  well, the Ukrainians are going to come out and say, we're the ones dying by the tens of thousands. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  Stop telling us what to do. This kind of relationship that has worked pretty well this [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=379.12s)]
*  far could get a little scratchy, and that would obviously be very counterproductive. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=384.0s)]
*  Into that end, Ben, I saw Jake Sullivan came out and briefed reporters today by the National [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=388.8s)]
*  Security Advisor. He said, we do not assess the conflict as a stalemate, which sort of [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=393.52s)]
*  counter to a lot of the reporting we've read. I guess maybe they mean Ukraine is making incremental [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=398.0s)]
*  progress. In slightly more positive news, the Washington Post reported that US clustered [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=402.08s)]
*  munitions are proving highly effective in stopping Russian counterattacks, though they [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=407.84000000000003s)]
*  aren't necessarily helping the Ukrainians break through Russian lines. Yes, I'm very aware, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=412.64s)]
*  listeners, of how depressing and gross it is to consider anything to do with clustered munitions [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=417.36s)]
*  to be positive, but this is a war and it's awful. Denmark and the Netherlands have agreed to provide [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=421.36s)]
*  Ukraine with F-16s, but that's obviously a ways off. As we discussed before, the US and South [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=426.32s)]
*  Africa have been butting heads over the war for many months, especially after there's reports that [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=432.16s)]
*  South Africa was selling weapons to the Russians. This week, South Africa will host the annual BRICS [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=437.04s)]
*  Summit, which brings together leaders from Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=442.56s)]
*  There's a lot of concern in Washington. I think that Putin himself was going to fly to South [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=447.44s)]
*  Africa to attend this summit in person, but it turns out now he is going to zoom in and [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=452.24s)]
*  avoid an ICC arrest warrant and I guess not give the world the middle finger like an in-person [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=459.44s)]
*  visit would have done. The South African President, Syo Ramefosa, reiterated that South Africa is not [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=464.72s)]
*  taking sides in the war, so it does seem like it's good diplomatic work to get us back on [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=470.0s)]
*  sides a little bit with South Africa there. Then, Ben, this isn't good news, but everyone's favorite [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=474.16s)]
*  insurrectionist warlord, Yevgeny Prigozhin, is in the Sahel region. He released a video saying he's [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=479.36s)]
*  going to make Russia great again, so great. Well, first of all, one of the things on the [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=484.96s)]
*  counteroffensive that occurs to me is that, and your point about the counteroffensive from the [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=490.56s)]
*  Russians brought this to mind, expectations were way too high for this counteroffensive at the [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=494.96s)]
*  beginning. We were trying to throw cold water on this idea that they're going to rout the Russians [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=499.84s)]
*  and there was so much hype around this. They may have inadvertently set expectations too high by [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=505.12s)]
*  talking about victory. They actually may be intentionally lowering expectations now. I think [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=510.64s)]
*  maybe the reason the US- It's like the Iowa caucuses. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=514.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Maybe the reason the US and the Ukrainians might be backgrounding, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=516.4s)]
*  oh, this counteroffensive isn't going well, so that when they do make some gains but not enormous [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=518.88s)]
*  gains, it looks like a success. That's one thing. On the BRICS summit, it's a mixed bag. On the one [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=523.68s)]
*  hand, it's pretty disappointing that almost two years into this full-scale invasion of Ukraine, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=529.28s)]
*  this entity, the BRICS that Russia's at the center of, that's meant to be this alternative [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=537.76s)]
*  world order to the US institutions like the G7 and others, it's still a hot ticket. In addition [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=542.0s)]
*  to the BRICS countries, other countries are being invited and it's meant to be this parallel [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=549.52s)]
*  alternative world order. The fact that that is happening with Russian participation indicates [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=554.48s)]
*  the degree to which it's just the West that's seen the Ukraine war as this seismic shift in [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=561.12s)]
*  geopolitics. It's business as usual for the BRICS countries and a lot of the others. By the way, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=567.04s)]
*  that includes like in India that was just given the red carpet treatment at the US state visit. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=573.36s)]
*  At the same time, the fact that Putin has to zoom in is an indication that something has changed. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=580.08s)]
*  It does diminish him, for sure. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=584.64s)]
*  Yeah, it diminishes him. It reminds everybody. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=585.28s)]
*  We've all zoomed into the group meeting. You feel like an asshole. You're up on screen, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=588.32s)]
*  you're talking over people, you never know who's in there really. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=591.12s)]
*  We've zoomed in, but we've never zoomed in because the ICC had an arrest warrant out. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=594.16s)]
*  As far as you know. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=597.6s)]
*  So every time that people see Putin zooming in, it's kind of a reminder that, okay, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=598.5600000000001s)]
*  this guy is like a person in Angra and the international parts of the national community. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=605.28s)]
*  So that's positive. The progrosian thing though does indicate that the Russian bet [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=610.24s)]
*  on parts of Africa is still there. We've been speculating that one of the reasons why [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=615.28s)]
*  progrosian is still alive is that he's the only guy who knows where the networks are in Africa, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=619.9200000000001s)]
*  where the money trail is in Africa, who they're paying off. And I think this video kind of [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=625.12s)]
*  confirms that. That this guy is not in Belarus at some military camp just hanging out. This [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=629.12s)]
*  guy is back doing what he was unfortunately good at and indispensable to Putin at, which is kind [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=634.4s)]
*  of running coups and mercenaries and all manner of natural resource grabs in Africa. And I think that [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=640.5600000000001s)]
*  is problematic. The Wagner group, a little bit of military expertise and hardware and willingness [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=648.24s)]
*  to use utter brute force can be very useful to a coup government in a place like Niger as it was [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=655.92s)]
*  in Burkina Faso or Mali, but not good enough to fight jihadist networks that have made gains when [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=662.16s)]
*  Wagner replaces the US or French. So something to watch here, is this just PR from progrosian or [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=671.2s)]
*  the start of another push by Wagner to take advantage of what's happened in Niger? I imagine [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=678.8s)]
*  unfortunately it's the latter. Yeah, I think it's the latter too. Probably not hopeful news for those [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=682.8s)]
*  who want the coup resolved quickly or at all. I guess this coup didn't work in Russia, but they [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=686.64s)]
*  could work more easily in Niger. Yeah, yeah. Hope springs eternal when you're an insurrectionist. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=691.44s)]

*  Let's switch gears to Saudi Arabia, Ben, because there was a horrible report released by Human [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=814.24s)]
*  Rights Watch on Monday which says that Saudi security forces have murdered hundreds, maybe [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=818.88s)]
*  thousands of Ethiopian migrants attempting to enter Saudi Arabia from Yemen. This report says [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=823.84s)]
*  that Saudi border guards have been shooting migrants at close range, firing rocket launchers [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=829.2s)]
*  and mortars at groups of hundreds of innocent people. It appears to be a policy of deliberately [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=834.32s)]
*  targeting migrants and asylum seekers with lethal force. Oftentimes these groups are mostly made up [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=840.48s)]
*  of women and children. The report covers the period from March 2022 through June 2023. Human [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=845.6800000000001s)]
*  Rights Watch says the killings are still happening as we speak. Migrants who survive these attacks [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=852.72s)]
*  are often taken to detention centers where they are tortured. One survivor interviewed said that [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=857.52s)]
*  male migrants in this group were forced to rape teenage girls they were traveling with by these [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=862.8000000000001s)]
*  Saudi security forces. Just like absolute sadists. One man who refused was murdered. An estimated [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=867.68s)]
*  750,000 Ethiopians live and work in Saudi Arabia but in recent years many more have fled Ethiopia [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=874.8s)]
*  to escape the civil war or just sort of general economic challenges. The people who attempt this [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=880.3199999999999s)]
*  journey they have to cross the Gulf of Aden. They're paying smugglers, they're paying human [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=884.88s)]
*  traffickers and they're being abused by both the Saudi government and by the Houthi rebel groups [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=888.9599999999999s)]
*  in Yemen. Human Rights Watch gathered a ton of evidence for this report. They interviewed [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=893.9200000000001s)]
*  dozens of migrants or their relatives and friends, analyzed hundreds of photos and videos. They found [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=898.72s)]
*  satellite images of mass graves. So Ben, I mean a couple thoughts. I hope the US and every other [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=903.2800000000001s)]
*  country denounces this and pressures the Saudis to change this policy immediately. The UN should [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=910.08s)]
*  do some sort of investigation. I believe Human Rights Watch recommended that. And then finally, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=915.36s)]
*  I don't think anyone should need another reminder of who Mohammed bin Salman is. But this is another [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=920.8s)]
*  reminder of who Mohammed bin Salman is and why the US should probably not be cutting some diplomatic [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=926.16s)]
*  deal with the Saudis where we give them a security guarantee that's NATO-like or a nuclear program. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=931.6s)]
*  It just doesn't seem like the best timing or the best idea to me. Call me crazy. I think you put [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=937.44s)]
*  your finger on the most important thing which is like this is who the Saudi government is. This is [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=941.84s)]
*  who Mohammed bin Salman is. This wouldn't be happening. This isn't just a few excessive uses [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=946.72s)]
*  of force. This is clearly a systematic use of totally extrajudicial killing and torture and [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=952.08s)]
*  brutality. By the way, at times to deal with migrants that are a result of the Saudi war in [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=958.48s)]
*  Yemen which caused its own humanitarian crisis. What MBS is good at doing is we've talked about [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=965.9200000000001s)]
*  the sports washing. He's buying golf. He wants you to look at the line city, the weird thing. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=973.52s)]
*  He'll never get built. Neom or whatever. Yeah. The kind of New York City highline except it [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=978.64s)]
*  goes on forever in Saudi Arabia. Or he'll make some change like women can go to the movies or [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=983.84s)]
*  something and everybody's like, oh, look at this guy. He's changing the Saudi society. He's a [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=989.76s)]
*  modernizer. Well, no. He massacres people like this. One of the problems, ironically, tragically, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=992.64s)]
*  of the Jamal Khashoggi crime is it was so horrific to just member this Washington Post journalist. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1000.4s)]
*  But that kind of became the one thing that we talked about. How can we be buddies with this guy [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1006.88s)]
*  MBS who massacred Jamal Khashoggi? Well, he's also a guy that continues to systematically arrest [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1013.12s)]
*  and mistreat and intimidate any political opposition. They continue to not be anywhere [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1020.0s)]
*  near where they should be on basic things like women's rights. They continue to engage in wars [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1025.36s)]
*  in places like Yemen that have caused mass humanitarian crises. They continue to back [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1032.0s)]
*  warlords across the Middle East and North Africa or military governance in places like Egypt that [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1036.8s)]
*  has been a disaster or the guys in Sudan that they were kind of playing both sides are now fighting [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1043.28s)]
*  civil war. The Khashoggi is the tip of an iceberg in terms of this guy's human rights records. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1048.56s)]
*  All the sports washing and all the money and all the diplomatic dance around the Abraham Accords [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1053.84s)]
*  is meant to avert your gaze from this stuff. Absolutely. Thank you to Human Rights Watch for [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1059.1999999999998s)]
*  documenting it. Tragically, usually it's worse than what they can uncover because if- [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1064.24s)]
*  Oh, exponentially. Yeah. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1068.8s)]
*  Hundreds is what they can prove. What they can prove. Imagine that's what a human rights [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1070.0s)]
*  organization working that's not literally on the ground in these prisons can see. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1073.9199999999998s)]
*  Imagine what the broader reality is. To me, we constantly have to be vigilant to not allow the [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1078.8s)]
*  reputation laundering, whether it's diplomatic or sports or whatever else it is, to avert our gaze [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1086.08s)]
*  from the true nature of what kind of leader MBS is. To your point about the normalization deal, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1092.56s)]
*  is this somebody that we want to be in business with permanently saying that they're basically [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1102.24s)]
*  have the status of a NATO ally. I don't know. This should make people deeply uncomfortable. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1106.96s)]
*  I also would love to know if any US assistance is going to these units conducting these massacres [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1111.6000000000001s)]
*  because that should trigger Leahy Law provisions that would have to stop any support or cooperation. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1117.04s)]
*  Right? That's a really good point. Also, part of the normalization talks are apparently mass amounts [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1123.28s)]
*  of increased arms sales too. Exactly. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1129.2s)]
*  So at a minimum, I hope that we're raising this diplomatically in addition to public. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1131.92s)]
*  In Congresses too. Speaking of staying in Saudi Arabia, the foreign minister of Iran apparently [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1136.88s)]
*  traveled to Saudi Arabia last week for talks, including with MBS, the Crown Prince. After the [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1142.56s)]
*  meeting, Iranian state news reported that MBS had agreed to reciprocate the visit and will go to [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1147.1200000000001s)]
*  Tehran sometime in the future. It's a big deal because in 2016, Iran and Saudi Arabia broke off [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1151.8400000000001s)]
*  diplomatic relations. They agreed to restore them in March of this year in this China-backed [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1157.6s)]
*  rapprochement. So one of those weird stories where obviously it would be great if Saudi Arabia [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1163.9199999999998s)]
*  and Iran could get along and not wage constant proxy and covert wars against each other. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1170.7199999999998s)]
*  But it also, again, makes it seem like a security guarantee for Saudi Arabia, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1178.08s)]
*  which is mostly about deterring attacks from Iran, might be even less necessary than people [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1183.44s)]
*  are leading us to believe. Yeah. I think if you look at MBS's behavior, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1188.56s)]
*  it's like he's trying to close all the accounts. The normalization deal, get all this stuff from [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1192.96s)]
*  the US, patch it up. I think he already gets along pretty well with Israel under the table, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1199.28s)]
*  but normalize there, maybe diffuse things in Iran. But what it is, is it's an access of total [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1204.8s)]
*  autocracy. So the Iranians want a lifeline at a time when they're facing a protest movement. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1212.32s)]
*  Maybe MBS wants us off this plate because he wants to be in a bigger weight class and fighting proxy [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1217.84s)]
*  wars with Iran. The Israelis obviously now in this far-right government stand to benefit. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1221.84s)]
*  It feels like this is an effort to close all the accounts and lock in the autocratic order [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1229.2s)]
*  in the region. And look, I'm glad they're talking. I'm glad that there's this, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1234.56s)]
*  I'd rather the Saudis and Iranians are engaged in diplomacy. I would just hope that there's some [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1239.92s)]
*  space to even at least incrementally press on these values issues from the United States [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1245.52s)]
*  standpoint. They still need us a lot. And look, I think that this could probably also be a part of [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1250.8000000000002s)]
*  the US and the West doing another nuclear deal, and the Saudis are more open to that because they [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1259.28s)]
*  have this line in with the Iranians. So there's good aspects to this from a state-to-state [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1265.28s)]
*  diplomatic standpoint. The question is, what does it mean for the people in the region, whether you're [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1270.96s)]
*  Iranian women or Saudi, anybody who doesn't like MBS in Saudi Arabia or one of these migrants? And [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1276.6399999999999s)]
*  there, I think we just have to continue to try to press these issues. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1283.12s)]
*  Yeah. The person who's really benefiting the most from the Saudi relationship is Donald Trump [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1285.76s)]
*  because they continue to host live golf tournament events at his courses. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1290.16s)]
*  Not to mention our friend Jared Kushner, who's sitting on a couple billion dollars. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1294.72s)]
*  Apparently not having much of a luck investing it. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1298.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. But did you see in something like 98% of his capital raised is outside the United States. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1300.5600000000002s)]
*  Of course. Shocker. Kickback. Speaking of Trump and his properties, there's a fun little twist [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1306.0s)]
*  in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case. As I'm sure everyone remembers, Trump decided to take [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1310.64s)]
*  hundreds of classified documents with him from the White House to Mar-a-Lago and then store them [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1316.0s)]
*  by his toilet. The US government shockingly didn't like that much. Trump now faces 40 separate [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1320.64s)]
*  criminal counts of stealing the documents and obstructing justice to get them back. Trump [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1326.0s)]
*  floated all these different reasons for what happened, including that he declassified all [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1331.12s)]
*  the documents before he left the White House. But according to a report from ABC News, that defense [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1334.88s)]
*  took a big hit when former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told prosecutors that he [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1340.4s)]
*  doesn't recall Trump ordering or even discussing declassifying broad sets of classified materials [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1344.24s)]
*  before leaving the White House, nor was there any standing declassification order. ABC News also [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1350.16s)]
*  reviewed an unpublished draft prologue from Meadows' book that came out last year that includes [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1355.36s)]
*  a description of Trump having a classified war plan sitting on his couch during a meeting [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1362.08s)]
*  attended by Meadows' ghostwriter and his publicist. Imagine being so fucking insecure as the former [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1367.36s)]
*  president that you pretend you left the Iran war plan on the couch. This isn't a novel you were [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1373.92s)]
*  reading and put down to answer the phone. You're clearly placing that to try to impress these people. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1380.88s)]
*  First of all, it's amazing. There have been so many other indictments that we forget. This is [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1387.3600000000001s)]
*  such an open and shut case. Every couple of weeks, some other piece of information comes out that's [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1391.68s)]
*  like, not only do you do these crimes, here's nine more independent corroborations of the exact thing. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1397.2s)]
*  Here's some texting of Anka. Yeah, I did it. Yeah. Here's the Iranian war plan being passed [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1402.72s)]
*  around at Mar-a-Lago wedding or something. On his Christmas card. Yeah. Yeah. If we had the right [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1409.6000000000001s)]
*  judge on this one, maybe this is the one that could move fastest. I also like the Mark Meadows [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1416.8s)]
*  piece of this is really telling because, first of all, just to take it substantively, if you wanted [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1420.88s)]
*  to declassify, you would have to tell somebody that. Now, Trump has given this crazy Sean Hannity [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1427.52s)]
*  interview where he said he could think something is declassified. No, there's a process. He's the [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1432.72s)]
*  mentalist, yeah. The process would be you'd have to tell the chief of staff or the national security [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1436.0s)]
*  advisor or the director of national intelligence, hey, I'd like to declassify these documents [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1440.4s)]
*  because then they run a process to do that. That clearly didn't happen here. That matters for the [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1444.16s)]
*  prosecution that he has no basis to make this argument whatsoever. Even Meadows seemed to [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1451.04s)]
*  understand this. I continue to be interested in who the audience is for these Mark Meadows books. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1457.2s)]
*  Because he has his own book, which I didn't even realize it come out because it came and went. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1463.6000000000001s)]
*  It's called Chief of Chiefs or something. I do love Mark Meadows is the bumbling [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1468.16s)]
*  Forrest Gump of the Trump orbit who just bumbles his way into criminal activity and getting his [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1472.64s)]
*  boss in trouble left and right. Turning over his texts and being like, oh, I didn't want to do that. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1478.16s)]
*  Can I have them back? And the prosecutor is like, no, what are you talking about? Yeah. So this book [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1481.92s)]
*  is called the Chief's Chief, which I'm just going to own up to the fact that I haven't read it. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1485.12s)]
*  But I don't even know what that means. But these guys like Meadows and Pompeo and [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1494.0s)]
*  who's the guy who was the other acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, these guys were the [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1503.6799999999998s)]
*  complete lunatic fringe when they were elected to Congress and the Tea Party election. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1509.4399999999998s)]
*  Trying to present themselves as these more reasonable guys, but like Meadows at every turn [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1515.1999999999998s)]
*  made all the wrong decisions. At best, he did nothing. At worst, he was enabling all this [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1518.56s)]
*  behavior. Like if you were the former chief of staff, like Dennis McDonough, right? Our former [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1524.1599999999999s)]
*  boss, chief of staff, very stricter to the rules, right? If Dennis McDonough came to my house [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1530.0s)]
*  and after we left government and saw like the classified Iran war plan there. He might kill you. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1537.84s)]
*  I don't think he would just like observe it and then be like, oh, maybe that's a good [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1542.24s)]
*  anecdote to drop in my prologue of my book. Hey, Buster, we're going to burn that. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1545.52s)]
*  Yeah. It goes to show like all these people were just so casual about national security [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1549.44s)]
*  and about criminality that his thought process and seeing the classified Iran war plan isn't like, [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1553.68s)]
*  hey, maybe we should shred that thing or better off return it. It's like, oh, this could be maybe [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1559.44s)]
*  sell a few books by dropping in the prologue. Yeah. I didn't mean to imply that Dennis [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1566.48s)]
*  would obstruct justice. I meant to imply that he would dispose of it in the proper way. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1569.2s)]
*  And dispose of us. Yeah. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1573.1200000000001s)]
*  And dispose of it in the proper way. Dennis, the nicest guy in the world who emailed us both [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1574.16s)]
*  yesterday to make sure we were okay. Los Angeles had a hurricane. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1578.4s)]
*  Survived the hurricane, which was 24 hours of rain, but we did it. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1581.2s)]
*  Speaking of LA hurricanes, let's talk about climate change, Ben. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1584.72s)]
*  Two pieces of good news for people who are worried about climate change. First, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1587.8400000000001s)]
*  Ecuadorians overwhelmingly voted to ban oil drilling in a national park situated in the [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1592.24s)]
*  Amazon rainforest. So the vote was 59% said no oil drilling. 41% said yes. So pretty overwhelming. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1596.72s)]
*  The Asuny national park spans about 2.5 million acres and it's one of the most biodiverse places [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1603.68s)]
*  on the planet. So good to preserve that. Also data released last month shows that deforestation in [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1609.6000000000001s)]
*  Brazil's Amazon fell 34% in the first half of 2023 thanks to Brazilian president Lula de Silva's [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1614.88s)]
*  environmental policies. So will either of those stories solve the problem? Of course not. Far from [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1621.44s)]
*  it. But it does show how important political decisions and political leadership can be, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1627.28s)]
*  especially everybody who worked hard to get fucking Jair Bolsonaro tossed out in Brazil. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1632.8s)]
*  Absolutely. I mean, you know, Latin America is going to be absolutely fundamental to [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1637.92s)]
*  preventing the kind of deforestation that could make any effort to mitigate climate change [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1641.8400000000001s)]
*  impossible. Southeast Asia, Latin America. And these are countries where, like you said, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1646.72s)]
*  ironically, it's not like the negotiation that happens at the COP that is doing this. It is the [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1652.0s)]
*  politics in these countries that matter. And so the people that care about climate change have to [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1660.96s)]
*  care about politics everywhere. Yes. Like significantly in the United States too. Yeah. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1665.6000000000001s)]
*  If you care about climate and you're some big philanthropist, well, maybe you should be thinking [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1670.48s)]
*  about political outcomes as much as financing some well-meaning NGO. I mean, we need to do that [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1674.64s)]
*  too. Do both. Do both is the point. And I think what's also important here is that, you know, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1683.5200000000002s)]
*  you're left in Brazil and they don't want to be told what to do at the Amazon. It's like a precious [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1688.16s)]
*  resource to them. So there has to be kind of a partnership in trying to help them find solutions [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1692.3200000000002s)]
*  rather than coming in and being like, here's what you do. And this is an indication that they [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1696.88s)]
*  understand what the value of those resources are. And with the right political leadership, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1701.04s)]
*  it makes a huge difference. And you got to make economic sense, right? You got to tell Ecuador, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1705.6s)]
*  look, ecotourism is going to benefit you much more in the long run than clear cutting this place [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1708.8s)]
*  and drilling. Yeah. And that could be a tough sell, but I think it worked here. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1713.52s)]
*  And it does also show the connection between politics on democracy and climate, which we've [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1716.96s)]
*  talked about a bit, which is that, you know, Bolsonaro is like an autocratic, self-interested [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1723.04s)]
*  nationalist. He's opened it up to all the loggers and people probably like, you know, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1728.16s)]
*  corrupt, making corrupt deals to get in the Amazon. Like, so, you know, having more small [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1733.68s)]
*  D democratic leaders winning in places is also good for the earth. Yeah, huge deal. Okay. Here's [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1738.24s)]
*  some bad news for climate change. So Canada has been dealing with massive unprecedented fires [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1744.48s)]
*  this year, wildfires that started with this dry and abnormally warm spring. That meant the fire [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1750.3200000000002s)]
*  started earlier and they spread ever since. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center says [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1755.12s)]
*  1037 fires were burning as of Monday and well over half of them were considered out of control. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1761.28s)]
*  Smoke from fires in British Columbia and also Washington and Oregon have blanketed the Pacific [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1767.76s)]
*  Northwest with smoke. Tens of thousands of people in Canada are under evacuation alerts or evacuation [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1772.7199999999998s)]
*  orders because fires have gotten so close to population centers. British Columbia is under a [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1778.08s)]
*  state of emergency. Prime Minister Trudeau said he's going to deploy the military to help people [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1782.72s)]
*  get out of there. Trudeau is also hammering Facebook. Do you see this? Yeah. For blocking, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1786.64s)]
*  sorry, meta, for blocking news content. X meta. Yeah. I'm not using your dumb terms. Facebook. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1791.6000000000001s)]
*  Twitter and Facebook guys. For blocking news content in Canada. So earlier this summer, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1796.88s)]
*  Facebook started blocking news content from Canada on its platforms because Canada passed a law [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1801.52s)]
*  requiring technology companies to pay publishers when they link to or repurpose their content. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1806.32s)]
*  It seems reasonable. Trudeau said, quote, right now in an emergency situation where up-to-date [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1811.28s)]
*  local information is more important than ever, Facebook is putting corporate profits ahead of [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1816.8799999999999s)]
*  people's safety. We should note that Google also said they're going to remove Canadian news links [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1821.36s)]
*  in response to this law, but they haven't done it yet. So Ben, familiar story here, climate change [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1825.92s)]
*  leading to severe weather, horrible fires, and also tech companies being assholes. Well, and this is [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1831.28s)]
*  a good example too of like, you know, some of these tech companies, you know, make donations to [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1837.04s)]
*  environmental causes, but then when their profit margin is impacted at all, it's not like Google or [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1842.48s)]
*  meta, whatever you want to call it, are going to have some huge hit because of this Canadian law. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1850.56s)]
*  Like, come on. They're trying to draw a line in the sand for others. Yeah. Do the right thing. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1854.1599999999999s)]
*  The one thing I will say is this cries out for kind of a regional effort because [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1857.2s)]
*  do you remember the North American Leaders Summit? Oh, how could I forget? NALS, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1862.8000000000002s)]
*  an acronym that nobody is aware of, which is essentially the leaders of the US, Canada, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1866.8000000000002s)]
*  and Mexico would meet once a year and you'd work on issues. It does feel to me like when you do [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1871.0400000000002s)]
*  have a good relationship like the US and Canada do, we should be looking at like a North American [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1876.8000000000002s)]
*  climate, you know, policy that would include a significant amount of US resources being available [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1881.6000000000001s)]
*  to deal with things like Canadian wildfires. We just have a lot more capacity. We have a huge [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1887.44s)]
*  defense budget, obviously, some of which could be relevant here. So one thing that I think the US [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1892.56s)]
*  and Canada can do is try to kind of harmonize and approach the wildfires. Look, I was in New York [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1897.68s)]
*  this summer and I was having trouble breathing because of Canadian wildfires. So there's a US [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1902.16s)]
*  interest in spending some resources on a North American approach to mitigate wildfires. That's [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1906.8s)]
*  the kind of future we're going into with this extreme weather. There's going to be cross border [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1912.16s)]
*  cooperation, not just on emissions reduction, but on all this kind of climate mitigation. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1915.6s)]
*  Totally agree with that. Let's turn to Ecuador because people in Ecuador went to the polls over [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1919.1999999999998s)]
*  the weekend to vote in presidential and legislative elections. Last week, we talked about the shocking [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1923.6799999999998s)]
*  assassination of a candidate named Fernando Villavicencio as he was exiting a campaign event. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1928.9599999999998s)]
*  Luisa Gonzalez, the candidate from the Democratic Socialist Party, got the most votes with 33% in [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1935.76s)]
*  the elections. She is seen as a protege, a former president, Rafael Correa, who is living in exile [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1941.68s)]
*  in Belgium after being convicted of bribery. She will face off against a 35-year-old member of [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1946.48s)]
*  Ecuador's National Assembly named Daniel Nuboa, who got 24%. He's more of a centrist, the son of [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1951.92s)]
*  a rich banana business guy who also has run for president before. All of these candidates were [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1957.04s)]
*  incredibly on edge during voting, obviously, because one of their rivals had just gotten [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1963.44s)]
*  assassinated. Ecuador also said that there were cyber attacks on their elections from a number of [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1967.36s)]
*  countries, but the results were not impacted. Regardless, the two leaders will go head to head [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1972.9599999999998s)]
*  and run off in October. The winner will hold office until 2025 because the outgoing president [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1979.6s)]
*  called for early elections. That's the latest from Ecuador. Yeah. Look, it took a lot of courage for [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1986.32s)]
*  these people to just keep campaigning. Can you imagine? Yeah. To me, it is a sign of some [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1992.48s)]
*  resilience of democracy here, even if the people that killed a candidate made their point too. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=1997.84s)]
*  I think you did see most of the political class in Ecuador stand up against this kind of thing, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2005.3600000000001s)]
*  and there was some defiance and resiliency, which is, I think, positive here. It does certainly feel [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2010.72s)]
*  like the leftist center candidate has the upper hand. We were talking also, Tommy, about the [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2015.92s)]
*  election in Guatemala. Oh, right. Yeah. You had the outsider candidate, the progressive candidate, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2020.64s)]
*  the anti-corruption candidate, Bernardo Arevalo, apparently win a pretty decisive victory over the [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2025.44s)]
*  weekend. A real glimmer of hope in Central America, where the politics has been, let's just say, [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2031.1200000000001s)]
*  not great between Bukele and El Salvador and Daniel Ortega and Nicaragua. This is worth noting as [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2035.92s)]
*  a real win for democracy and anti-corruption and progressive values against long odds. Frankly, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2043.8400000000001s)]
*  you're kind of drawn the short straw. You kind of walk in that viper's nest of corruption and money. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2051.04s)]
*  Short term, too. Yeah. But this is definitely a good outcome. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2057.04s)]
*  Yeah. So you brought us up. I'm going to bring us back down by talking about the far right in [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2060.3199999999997s)]
*  Germany. We often talk about the rise of these far right political parties, especially [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2064.16s)]
*  right-wing populists. One such party is the Alternative for Germany or AFD party. AFD is [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2069.04s)]
*  virulently extreme and right-wing, anti-LGBT. They want to deport migrants. They talk about openly [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2076.4s)]
*  preferring a Trumpian style of communication. They talk about the great replacement theory all the [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2082.8s)]
*  time. According to the Washington Post, the AFD is now polling at around 21%, making it the second [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2087.04s)]
*  most popular party in Germany. They are riding economic concerns, anger about immigration, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2096.0s)]
*  and it is creating this sort of political conundrum for the center-right Christian Democratic party [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2102.2400000000002s)]
*  as they have to decide, do we work with these people and try to siphon off some of their support? [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2108.6400000000003s)]
*  You ostracize them. So it's like a classic conundrum that people deal with when managing [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2113.36s)]
*  the far right. So it's worrisome to have these far right parties doing well, especially in Germany, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2119.6000000000004s)]
*  of all places. The other part about this that is different in Germany is the AFD is gaining more [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2126.48s)]
*  support while becoming more radical. They're not moderating to gain support like you saw in Italy, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2134.88s)]
*  for example. This is not an unfamiliar feeling for us in America where we watched the Republican [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2140.4s)]
*  Party win elections by becoming more radical in 2016, but it is concerning and by the way, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2148.08s)]
*  it's connected to all the other things we talked about like support for Ukraine, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2153.04s)]
*  climate change, immigration, all the broader systemic problems. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2156.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's never good when the Nazis get a foothold in Germany. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2160.24s)]
*  Don't love that. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2166.16s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, the AFD has deep roots in neo-Nazi far-right ideology and they've been lingering [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2166.8s)]
*  around, but they've usually kind of hit five, 10% ceiling. And so this nudging up [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2175.2799999999997s)]
*  should be seen as a big warning sign. And look, we've taken issue with, made fun of, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2183.12s)]
*  and we'll probably do it again with Vivek in a few minutes here, these critiques of the [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2194.0s)]
*  Ukraine war. But the reality is part of what is happening is you had this massaged energy disruption, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2198.16s)]
*  you've had cost of living crises, you have lots of refugees from Ukraine now in Germany, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2204.16s)]
*  and that does present a set of challenges. And just because that doesn't mean that therefore [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2211.6s)]
*  we should withdraw our support for Ukraine. But sometimes people don't want to talk about [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2217.2799999999997s)]
*  those challenges because they think just talking about those challenges somehow delegitimizes [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2222.08s)]
*  support for Ukraine. No, I think it's very important to name these issues and to have [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2226.96s)]
*  European leaders close to public opinion on this stuff. And I think Ola Schultz has done a pretty [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2231.6s)]
*  good job as Chancellor of Germany, but clearly there needs to be constant effort to kind of [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2238.16s)]
*  name the anxieties that people are feeling in Europe so that you don't have a set of politicians [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2242.88s)]
*  who are like, no, we're doing the right thing, nothing to see here. And then the radicals seem [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2248.0s)]
*  like the ones who are telling the truth. And so I think a much more kind of honest, close to the [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2252.16s)]
*  ground conversation about politics in all these countries is going to be necessary, or else we [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2256.96s)]
*  could look up in a few years and you got the National Front in France and Maloney in Italy, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2261.28s)]
*  and maybe the AFD is not in charge, but they suddenly- They're playing a coalition or something. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2265.76s)]
*  They've knocked down the door. This is something you really got to nip in the bud. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2269.84s)]
*  It's worrisome. It's worrisome. So you mentioned Vivek Ramaswamy. The first Republican debate is [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2274.1600000000003s)]
*  happening on Wednesday, August 23rd. We record this the day before, so we don't know what's [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2279.52s)]
*  going to be discussed. But it seems like Ramaswamy is going to come under attack for some recent [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2283.92s)]
*  comments he made about Israel. Here's a clip. I'm a dealmaker. Okay. I want to negotiate now [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2289.2s)]
*  Abraham Accords 2.0. Get Saudi, Oman, Qatar, Indonesia in there. Get Israel on its own two [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2294.64s)]
*  feet. And I believe in standing by commitments that we've already made. So our commitments have, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2302.88s)]
*  I think, $38 billion in aid, military support, et cetera, going in through 2028. I want to get [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2306.72s)]
*  Israel to the place where it is negotiated back into the infrastructure of the rest of the Middle [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2314.16s)]
*  East. We should not be worried about holding one nation or one region hostage over one particular [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2319.04s)]
*  question relating to Palestine. Go to Abraham Accords 2.0. That's good for Israel. It's good [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2325.52s)]
*  for the rest of the Middle East. It's good for us, such that come 2028, that additional aid won't be [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2331.12s)]
*  necessary in order to still have the kind of stability that we'd actually have in the Middle [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2336.72s)]
*  East by having Israel more integrated in with its partners. He made these comments on Russell [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2341.04s)]
*  Brand's show on Rumble. Yes, the guy from Get Him to the Greek is doing presidential interviews. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2346.48s)]
*  So Nikki Haley, former ambassador to the UN under Trump, came out swinging at Vivek. She said, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2352.8s)]
*  he is completely wrong to call for ending America's special bond with Israel. Support for Israel is [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2359.12s)]
*  both the morally right and strategically smart thing to do. And if elected president, I will [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2363.12s)]
*  never abandon Israel. In response to Haley, Vivek's spokesperson said, we wish her well on [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2368.24s)]
*  her future in corporate America's boardrooms. Great hit. But then Mark Levin, who's this very [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2373.6s)]
*  popular conservative radio host, also criticized him. Vivek responded more substantively saying, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2380.3999999999996s)]
*  he will accomplish the Abraham Accords 2.0 in his first year, which means Israel will be fully [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2387.04s)]
*  integrated into the region so they will have all the support it needs. It's just like, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2392.4799999999996s)]
*  it's classic Vivek Ramaswamy policy and then it's all four or five D chests. And he talks [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2397.6s)]
*  about incredibly hard things as if they are simple. But it is a pretty radical departure [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2403.92s)]
*  from the orthodoxy in either party when it comes to aid Israel. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2409.12s)]
*  Yeah. First of all, I just I love that guy's verbal text, which we talked about last week, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2414.08s)]
*  because it's such self-assurance, you know, which kind of makes it hard to not think like, well, [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2418.48s)]
*  does this guy like know what he's talking about? So you see why he's kind of catching on a little [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2424.48s)]
*  bit, because he says things with such like absolute assurance. To me, what was interesting about this [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2429.44s)]
*  is a couple of things. First of all, the substance of what he said should actually like not be [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2435.76s)]
*  basically what he's saying is, if Abraham Accords 2.0 as he brands it, is Israel's basically [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2443.6s)]
*  normalized relations with everybody and given nothing to Palestinians and can kind of crush them, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2449.44s)]
*  then why do we need to give them four billion dollars in military assistance a year? [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2455.52s)]
*  It's not a unreasonable question. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2460.88s)]
*  Yeah. You know, like I don't even support a lot of ifs. Yeah. I don't even support the [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2462.2400000000002s)]
*  Abraham Accords 2.0. But like if you follow his logic train, like I actually don't know that Nikki [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2467.28s)]
*  Haley has her finger on the pulse of the Republican voter. I don't think she does. Right. Like I think [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2472.64s)]
*  he's breaking the wall. Like the Democratic parties have this debate. I think what he's [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2477.76s)]
*  doing is he's signaling that this is probably a debate that's coming to the Republican party, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2483.1200000000003s)]
*  too. And for some good reasons, substantive reasons like why are we giving a wealthy country [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2486.6400000000003s)]
*  that is a regional military superpower four billion dollars a year in military aid, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2492.48s)]
*  probably some not good reasons, too. Like some of that MAGA base has probably, you know, [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2497.92s)]
*  some of them are evangelicals who want the Jews to convert at the rapture. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2502.88s)]
*  Some of them may, you know, they like George George's dog whistles and, you know, like what [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2506.24s)]
*  Vivek is saying for bad reasons. I think one of the things that was most interesting to me, Tommy, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2510.72s)]
*  is like the way this was received. The New York Times. So I'm I don't know if I'm picking on the [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2514.9599999999996s)]
*  New York Times or the nature of American politics or who pick away. But they they have a paragraph [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2520.64s)]
*  here that said opponents have attacked Mr. Ramoswami for his assertions that he would leave Taiwan [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2527.6s)]
*  the Chinese once the United States has officially expanded its semiconductor industry. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2532.56s)]
*  He would allow Russia to keep parts of Ukraine in order to entice Vladimir Putin away from his [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2536.2400000000002s)]
*  alliance with China. Then he said he would curtail military aid to Israel after stabilizing the [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2540.88s)]
*  Middle East, perhaps the politically riskiest position yet. That's a crazy sentence. Like, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2545.04s)]
*  like, like, you know, and maybe this is not a shot the times. It's more shot at like how [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2552.2400000000002s)]
*  the perceptions of foreign policy become received wisdom. It is is it more controversial to suggest [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2556.72s)]
*  we should not give four billion dollars to Israel than it is to say that China can have two [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2563.68s)]
*  democracies be crushed and Russia can have Ukraine like that. There's something wrong with the [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2569.8399999999997s)]
*  politics of foreign policy when that is a normal sentence. Right. Yeah, I had not read that. Yeah, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2574.7999999999997s)]
*  like it's really troubling. And I know what the Times is reflecting. It's not just the Times, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2580.08s)]
*  but it's like, you know, I don't think this is sustainable, this idea that you can't even broach [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2584.56s)]
*  these issues. You know, I think this is this debate about aid is coming. The 10 year Memorandum of [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2589.36s)]
*  Understanding that guides U.S. military to Israel is expiring soon. And I'm not sure. I think there [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2595.52s)]
*  can be people in both parties are going to be like, we're we're signing up for another 40 billion [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2602.24s)]
*  dollars, 50 billion dollars in aid to a country that really doesn't need it. And some of them are [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2606.7999999999997s)]
*  telling us they don't want it because that's mainly aid that gets channeled through U.S. defense [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2613.2s)]
*  contractors. So anyway, I hate to say Vivek has a take that is worth consideration. It's a stop [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2616.8799999999997s)]
*  clock that is right periodically. But, you know, he's stirring a pot that I think is going to be [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2622.16s)]
*  stirred increasingly. It is interesting. Here's one other clip of him talking about the United [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2627.12s)]
*  Nations. Speaking of pod stirring, I think we need to stop funding organizations that are hostile to [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2631.7599999999998s)]
*  the sovereignty of the U.S. That includes the WHO. That may very well include the UN. I am [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2637.52s)]
*  perfectly open to reevaluating the U.S.'s continued involvement in the UN itself. If the UN Security [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2644.16s)]
*  Council is staffed by the likes of Venezuela and North Korea, it is a joke. And we have to call out [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2651.52s)]
*  that farce for what it is. I've already said I would shut down the CDC. That's on my list of [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2656.96s)]
*  three letter agencies that I would shut down here in the United States here at home. And my general [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2660.96s)]
*  view, this is I'm only saying half jokingly here, but if it comes in an acronym, chances are we [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2665.68s)]
*  should be skeptical of it. He wants to like shut down half of the government. It is far more [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2670.96s)]
*  radical the things he's saying about like getting rid of the CDC. I think he wants to shut down the [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2676.48s)]
*  FBI. I forget maybe the EPA. There's all these acronyms, the agencies that he just wants to [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2681.04s)]
*  get rid of. I mean, the WHO stuff is insane. Like we what we we benefit from the WHO. Like do we not [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2687.04s)]
*  want any international effort to prevent pandemics? I don't like diseases. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2693.84s)]
*  Like what would happen if there's an Ebola outbreak? You know, who do you think we call [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2698.8s)]
*  the international system on the UN point? The UN point is is weird to me for I get why Vivek. You [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2702.8s)]
*  know, it's it's an easy target. Old school John Bolton. But that's that's what's interesting me [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2708.8s)]
*  about the vague is like doing this is that that that's kind of like retro. That's like 20 years [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2713.92s)]
*  ago. Like the UN is really does anybody think the UN is the problem? Like the problem in the UN right [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2718.56s)]
*  now is that Russia and China are paralyzing it. So like the reason the Security Council isn't able [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2724.48s)]
*  to solve any problems isn't because it's quote unquote staffed by Venezuelans and North Koreans. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2730.32s)]
*  I didn't know what the fuck he's talking about there. They need some woke reason. It's a problem [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2735.12s)]
*  or some communist reason. That's really the problem. One really notes Russia and China. Yeah. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2739.2s)]
*  And the Republicans are the dog that caught the car on this one because they've demagogued the [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2743.2799999999997s)]
*  UN for so long. But now it's the Russians and Chinese are like, Hey, the UN headquartered in [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2746.56s)]
*  New York City with a bunch of rules were written by the United States is basically in their view, [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2751.2s)]
*  an extension of the West. And so therefore, we're going to have our own bricks thing. So Vivek saying [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2757.04s)]
*  he's going to break the UN is kind of like breaking the pieces of the international system that we [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2762.0s)]
*  fucking built. These guys want to get rid of all the institutions that benefit US security like [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2767.92s)]
*  no, no, as well. Yeah, exactly. It's a self owned like all these things that these people want to [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2772.0s)]
*  buy the way just real quick on this because he's giving Taiwan to the Chinese. He's giving Ukraine [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2775.84s)]
*  to the Russians. He's blowing up the UN, which is something the Russians and Chinese want. Like, [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2780.32s)]
*  maybe start to time to ask questions with this. The six month crash course he's been on seems [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2785.36s)]
*  to really benefit people. Who was your teacher? Yeah, sir. Please fill us in. Tucker Carlson. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2789.84s)]
*  Yeah, Tucker. It probably was Tucker. So Ben, last week, an unmanned Russian spacecraft crash [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2794.88s)]
*  landed into the moon. The Luna 25 probe was Russia's first lunar mission to the moon in [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2800.72s)]
*  nearly 50 years. It was designed to check out the lunar South Pole because scientists think [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2805.52s)]
*  there might be a bunch of ice there, which would be critical in terms of a water supply [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2810.72s)]
*  and oxygen supply for supporting life on the moon in the future. India also launched a lunar mission. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2815.3599999999997s)]
*  It is supposed to land on Wednesday, August 23rd. So the day this comes out, if the mission is a [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2821.7599999999998s)]
*  success, it would obviously be a feather in the cap for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and a [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2826.4s)]
*  bit humiliating for the Russians since they launched their probe early because they wanted [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2831.28s)]
*  to beat India to the moon, to the lunar South Pole. So Ben, I'm sure there are some resistance [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2836.1600000000003s)]
*  accounts that are dunking on this on Twitter and cheering about Russia's failure. And look, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2844.0s)]
*  I get that, right? I mean, you don't want anything that sort of benefits Putin as a PR win is probably [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2849.44s)]
*  not great right now. But bigger picture in long term, it would be great for all of us to work [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2854.4s)]
*  together on space exploration and not have to rely on assholes like Elon Musk or not have a Plan B if [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2858.7200000000003s)]
*  the planet burns. I mean, if I'm Russian, I'm like, all right, we're already like our economy is in [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2866.0s)]
*  shitter because of this stupid fucking war. We're dealing with sanctions. We're spending all this [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2870.2400000000002s)]
*  money in Ukraine. And why are we landing something on the moon? Like it just shows the megalomania of [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2874.4s)]
*  Putin. I just think this should be a vulnerability for him. What's the point of doing moon missions? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2879.84s)]
*  And also this kind of weird space race to get to the moon. I'll be a little jingoistic here. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2886.4s)]
*  We had guys hitting golf balls on the moon when Johnny Carson was hosting The Tonight Show, [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2891.44s)]
*  I wish we could cooperate more and achieve international aims in space rather than have [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2901.84s)]
*  this kind of weird retro space race. Yeah, it is crazy. Was that great? One of my favorite attacks [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2906.24s)]
*  on Barack Obama ever. One of the dumbest quotes I've ever read. How are you going to teach our [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2913.2s)]
*  kids to reach for the stars when you're cutting funding for the very same things allow them to- [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2920.24s)]
*  RNC spokesman Danny Diaz said, it is ironic that Barack Obama's plan to help our children reach [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2924.8799999999997s)]
*  for the stars is financed in part by slashing a program that helps us learn about those very [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2929.4399999999996s)]
*  same stars. It was a quaint time when politics was about issuing statements that appealed the [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2933.76s)]
*  swing states and that was meant to appeal to Florida because we were cutting some launch [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2938.48s)]
*  pad in Florida. Incredible, incredible. Last story before we get to the interview. So we need to [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2942.8s)]
*  talk about diplomacy, dining and dashing, Ben. So here's the backstory. Four Italian tourists [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2948.1600000000003s)]
*  went to Albania. They had a nice dinner. They reportedly enjoyed the food and then they ran [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2953.36s)]
*  out of there without paying the check. They were caught on security video and the clip blew up on [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2957.92s)]
*  social media. It became such big news that the prime minister of Albania raised this exact issue [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2962.88s)]
*  with Italian prime minister, Giorgia Maloney, while she was visiting Albania. Maloney responded [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2970.4s)]
*  by telling the Italian ambassador to Albania to quote, go and pay the bill for these idiots, [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2976.32s)]
*  end quote. And she sent this guy over to the restaurant and they picked up the 80 euro tab. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2981.28s)]
*  So Ben, to me, this is a reminder that you might be a bit of a fascist. You might be a fan of a [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2986.32s)]
*  Mussolini, but you can also be pretty good at politics. That's shrewd. That is really good at [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2992.72s)]
*  politics. I have to say, I mean, it's a dumb thing because like people run on the check everywhere [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=2997.12s)]
*  and it doesn't have to be international incident, but I get that the Albanians feel like, you know, [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3000.7999999999997s)]
*  that's the Italians looking down on them. So exactly that's, you know, there's a reason why she's, [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3004.64s)]
*  she's, she's very good at politics. I think she's, you know, I don't agree with her politics, [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3009.2799999999997s)]
*  but I think she's gonna be around for a while. I did too. The New York Times had an interesting [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3013.7599999999998s)]
*  profile on her recently. It was also featured on the daily. They talked about some of the ways [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3017.7599999999998s)]
*  she seems to have moderated. They are kicking out the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative programs. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3022.16s)]
*  They are seemingly a lot less anti-EU. She's not yanking support out from under the, [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3028.3999999999996s)]
*  the Ukrainians yet. So it, she's turned out to be more complicated, I think, than we thought. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3035.2799999999997s)]
*  She's like maintains her far right view of immigration. And I think what she's calculated [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3040.3199999999997s)]
*  is that's the bread and butter for my base. And these other areas I can give in ways that help me [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3045.8399999999997s)]
*  because, you know, like it's better for her to not be ostracized. She got invited to Washington. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3052.08s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Okay. That is it for us for the news. When we take a quick break and then we're [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3057.2s)]
*  going to come back, you'll hear my interview with President Biden's top Asia hand, Kirk Campbell, [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3062.48s)]

*  your way through, but you know, sometimes we're faced with a crossroads in life and we don't know [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3081.92s)]

*  Indo-Pacific Affairs, Kurt Campbell. Kurt, it's great to see you. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3140.7200000000003s)]
*  Tommy, it's great to see you as well. I wish I was there with you in person. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3143.6800000000003s)]
*  I wish you were here too. But you've been a busy man. Last week, President Biden hosted [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3146.88s)]
*  the president of Japan and South Korea at Camp David for this historic summit. Historic because [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3152.88s)]
*  you guys hashed out a new defense agreement and because there has been some longstanding animosity [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3158.88s)]
*  between Japan and South Korea. Can you tell us a bit about how this came together [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3163.28s)]
*  and what you guys accomplished? Sure. Thank you. And Tommy, it's a great way to begin. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3168.8s)]
*  So first of all, our probably our two closest allies in Asia or certainly in Northeast Asia, [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3173.36s)]
*  Japan and South Korea, each ally like nearly 80 years old. And we're very close and we have [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3179.28s)]
*  a security commitment to both of them. The challenge has been during the Second World [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3186.7200000000003s)]
*  War and before, obviously, Japan occupied South Korea, a brutal colonial experience and also [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3192.72s)]
*  tough fighting during the Second World War. I think it'd be fair to say that neither country [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3202.72s)]
*  really fully recovered from that experience. And so for decades, there have been start and stop [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3207.7599999999998s)]
*  efforts to try to rebuild trust and confidence. Each time that you might see a little bit of [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3214.72s)]
*  progress, then you'd see backtracking. So basically, when President Biden came to office, [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3220.56s)]
*  he had tried working on this himself when he was vice president. Tommy, you recall when you were [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3226.4s)]
*  working with President Biden, I remember him leaving the room saying, man, those guys don't [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3231.92s)]
*  like each other. And so when he first came to power here as president, he instructed us to basically [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3236.32s)]
*  work behind the scenes, do what's possible to try to bring these two really treasured allies [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3242.7999999999997s)]
*  more closely together. So we had a series of interactions, mostly private, some trilateral, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3249.04s)]
*  kind of behind the scenes, shuttling, trying new ideas, new concepts. But it wasn't until we had [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3254.4s)]
*  new leadership in both Japan and South Korea. South Korea in particular, President Yoon, [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3260.64s)]
*  elected last year, has taken heroic, courageous steps, basically to underscore his commitment [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3265.7599999999998s)]
*  and Korea's commitment to mending fences and moving forward with Japan. And Japan, [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3274.24s)]
*  under Prime Minister Kishida, I think carefully has responded. So what we saw last week was an [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3280.16s)]
*  effort to take this fledgling, bipartisan sort of agreement between these two countries into a [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3286.16s)]
*  trilateral context. So we rolled out all these things that our three countries will do together [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3293.52s)]
*  in an attempt to lock in that cooperation and to place the United States at the center [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3299.04s)]
*  of this engagement. Now, Tommy, you were at Cape David many times. This was only my second time [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3305.6s)]
*  there. Terribly exciting, really wonderful to see my Japanese and South Korean friends there with [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3312.16s)]
*  the president. I think everyone felt that it was tremendously significant. And the word historic [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3320.24s)]
*  is thrown around a lot, but I think it'd be fair to say this was historic. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3326.88s)]
*  Yeah. I think you have to say something there, which is this meeting and these tough conversations [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3330.48s)]
*  are very difficult politics for both of these leaders back home. So it's a courageous political [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3335.52s)]
*  decision. They allowed my ass at Camp Taven one time. It was in 2012. And they said, please [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3339.6800000000003s)]
*  don't come back. This was the G8, now the G7. My memories of it are watching soccer with a bunch [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3344.08s)]
*  of the leaders of the Champions League final. And then Dmitry Medvedev was there. It was his last [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3350.56s)]
*  hurrah on the world stage until he and his entourage were pushed out by Vladimir Putin. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3356.0s)]
*  So I remember he and his crew got shitfaced until two in the morning. And then I think they tried [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3360.4s)]
*  to order 27 hamburgers from the Navy mess. So do you guys get into any creative diplomacy [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3365.36s)]
*  or get in any trouble? Most of what we're involved with in staff is stealing as much [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3371.2s)]
*  shit as possible. And so I didn't have as much time to drink because I came home and my wife said, [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3377.2s)]
*  Kurt, you've got 700 notepads. I'll be able to write a note every day for the rest of my life. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3384.48s)]
*  So we have shirts, notepads, everything possible. We bought lots of stuff, stuff that I will never [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3391.12s)]
*  wear. None of my kids will wear. But it just felt so exciting to be there. We had to have [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3398.0s)]
*  things that we would take. Yeah, you got to take the chachkis. Okay. Allow me to pretend to be a [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3402.8799999999997s)]
*  hard-ass journalist for a second. Sure. Okay. Go ahead. So imagine China's military buildup was [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3407.04s)]
*  probably a big part of the conversation. If you and I were sitting in Beijing, we might say, [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3411.6s)]
*  look at these goddamn Americans. They are giving nuclear subs to the Australians. They're shipping [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3418.0s)]
*  weapons to Taiwan. They're hosting this summit. They're trying to contain us, right? They're [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3423.2s)]
*  driving this arms race and they're doing it all to check us. What's your response to that? [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3428.3199999999997s)]
*  We're obviously, Tommy, in an action and reaction cycle. I would simply say, you forgot to mention [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3433.12s)]
*  the Quad, other things that we're doing in the Philippines. So you're right. They have a very [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3440.0s)]
*  established narrative of all the things that we are purportedly doing to keep them down. I will [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3445.28s)]
*  simply say that probably no country has done more to support China's rise, help with investment and [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3450.64s)]
*  capacity and know-how than the United States. And almost every country in the Indo-Pacific [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3459.28s)]
*  wants a predictable, stable relationship between their country and China. So I just [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3467.04s)]
*  begin with that as a proposition. I think what we've seen over the course progressively of the [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3472.72s)]
*  last 10 years is a leader in Xi Jinping that is increasingly ambitious, prepared to take risks, [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3479.44s)]
*  believes that the United States is in just profound decline and that it's China's time [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3487.84s)]
*  to basically strike on the international scene. And I think our response would be not so fast [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3494.0s)]
*  and that the United States has worked with allies and partners to, Tommy, essentially construct what [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3501.36s)]
*  we might describe as an operating system in the Indo-Pacific. And that operating system has [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3507.12s)]
*  yielded unprecedented prosperity. We've lifted billions of people out of poverty. We've kept [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3513.68s)]
*  peace and stability and this fabric of the maintenance of peace and stability, [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3519.92s)]
*  peaceful resolution of disputes, maritime security. There are many elements that go into this, [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3525.6s)]
*  but almost every state that we've engaged believes that there are aspects of this operating system [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3534.0s)]
*  that are essential. And what China's trying to do as an arriving state, sorry to go international [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3541.12s)]
*  relations on you. I like it too. Is trying to revise that system in ways that frankly are not [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3547.04s)]
*  in the interests of these countries. So I think what we are seeing is a response to China. I do [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3554.48s)]
*  not believe that this is a nudist around China's neck. None of these countries want to contain [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3561.92s)]
*  China. They want to have good relations with China, but they are worried about the direction [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3566.96s)]
*  that China's policy has taken over the last several years. And they look to the United States [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3572.72s)]
*  to be stable, firm, clear and tough. Yeah. Xi Jinping is going to build an [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3577.9199999999996s)]
*  island off the coast of Delaware and blame it on you, pal. So in their one and only office, [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3583.68s)]
*  Oval Office meeting after Trump won the election, President Obama reportedly warned him that the [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3589.2s)]
*  threat from North Korea was urgent, that their nuclear weapons program was something he needed [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3594.9599999999996s)]
*  to get on top of. Of course, we're sitting here six years later, North Korea has got more nukes, [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3599.2s)]
*  they got better missiles. I believe they're able to launch them from subs now, despite all of Trump's, [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3603.68s)]
*  let's call it creative efforts at diplomacy. Do you think it's time to admit that we are not [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3608.96s)]
*  going to put the toothpaste back in the tube here and that North Korea will never give up its nukes? [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3614.0s)]
*  So I'm still about trying to get that toothpaste back in the tube. It's a thankless task. But I [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3619.12s)]
*  will say since President Biden has come to office, his determination has been to do whatever possible [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3625.76s)]
*  to reach out without condition to make clear that we want to resume a dialogue and work constructively [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3632.8s)]
*  with North Korea. Look, Tommy, I will tell you this, that when COVID struck North Korea, we were [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3639.92s)]
*  terribly worried that this would lead to enormous human consequences. We offered vaccines, we offered [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3646.6400000000003s)]
*  support behind the scenes, very carefully, not done for publicity or propaganda purposes, but to [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3654.3199999999997s)]
*  hopefully signal our genuine desire to support and help the people of North Korea. Essentially, [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3661.3599999999997s)]
*  since President Trump stormed out of Hanoi now seven years ago, we've really had no engagement [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3668.24s)]
*  with North Korea, but we are not alone. Japan, South Korea, other countries have also tried. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3676.16s)]
*  They are simply, I think, in the current context, working closely with China in a few things, [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3682.48s)]
*  practicing some military tests, and essentially unhappy with the status quo in Northeast Asia. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3689.84s)]
*  We're going to continue to engage. Our response to North Korean provocations is what you saw in Camp [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3696.64s)]
*  David last week. Solidarity, a sense of common purpose between our allies and partners in [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3702.88s)]
*  Northeast Asia. I know you got to go soon, so let's try one last question. I assume you're [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3709.52s)]
*  probably going to go to a meeting where you try to deal with the North Korean nuclear program or [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3714.24s)]
*  something. Ben and I noticed that Joe Biden did a fundraiser, likes to talk about China. He recently [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3717.36s)]
*  called the Chinese economy a ticking time bomb in many cases. He said, they've got some problems, [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3723.84s)]
*  that's not good, because when bad folks have problems, they do bad things. Ben and I kind [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3728.64s)]
*  of wondered if this was maybe, I don't know, an intelligence assessment. There was a sense that [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3732.4s)]
*  Xi Jinping might see this massive youth unemployment. They might see this looming [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3738.0800000000004s)]
*  economic crisis with this kind of ghost real estate bubble that's been built up. I don't know, [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3742.4s)]
*  one way to distract from that is to make a move on Taiwan. Is that something folks should be [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3747.44s)]
*  concerned about? I think the truth is, is that we're still trying to understand, Tommy, what's [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3752.0800000000004s)]
*  happening in the Chinese economy. You pointed to a couple of things that we're tracking closely, [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3757.92s)]
*  youth unemployment, the property bubble, some issues associated with debt, not only at the [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3763.92s)]
*  national level, but at local levels as well. The Chinese economy has slowed down substantially. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3771.76s)]
*  The government has taken steps that in many respects, we believe undermine innovation. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3778.32s)]
*  They've made it illegal to talk about just data in the economy as a national security threat. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3785.2000000000003s)]
*  There are many things that are going on in China that are impeding growth, that are causing the [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3791.7599999999998s)]
*  wheels, if not to come off, certainly to slow down substantially with respect to Chinese [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3798.96s)]
*  economic performance. The question is always in that environment, if you are facing domestic [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3805.36s)]
*  headwinds and challenges, does that cause you to be less ambitious internationally, to hedge your [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3812.88s)]
*  bets, to be more careful? Or does it cause you to think about, look, we've got to distract attention [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3820.4s)]
*  and take steps that would lead to more provocative actions? I don't think we really know the answer [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3828.0s)]
*  now. The truth is, you can see one strategy followed for a while and then suddenly the other. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3834.96s)]
*  I think it requires the United States to be deeply focused, to remain vigilant, to work with China [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3844.4s)]
*  where we can, which we're determined to do, and work closely. As we speak, Tommy, it was just [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3852.2400000000002s)]
*  announced that our very able Commerce Secretary Ramundo will be in China next week. We are keeping [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3859.04s)]
*  those lines of communication open. In truth, I think no one would have expected that the [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3865.44s)]
*  US economy post-COVID would be booming and China would be facing challenges. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3871.12s)]
*  But it is a lesson that those who underestimate the United States do so at their own peril. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3878.48s)]
*  Well, Kurt, I want to tell you that one, Ben and I pledge that if we see one of those spy balloons [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3884.16s)]
*  over Los Angeles, we'll shoot it down ourselves. And two, congratulations on the summit. I can only [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3890.48s)]
*  imagine how many hours you guys spent in the Situation Room preparing for this thing. It must [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3896.24s)]
*  have been an ungodly amount of work. So congrats. It's a huge deal. It was a lot of work, but blowing [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3901.12s)]
*  up those balloons also, your arm muscles get really tired. Awesome. Well, listen, thanks again. And [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3905.6s)]
*  it was great having you on. Let's do it again soon. Great. Say hello to everyone for me. Thank you [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3913.04s)]
*  very much. Will do. See you, Kurt. Thanks again to Kurt for joining the show. Don't dine and dash, [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3916.8799999999997s)]
*  people. It's just a dick move. You know, okay, I did this once. How old were you? I was like 17. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3921.36s)]
*  There was like an all night diner that you could go to like drunk at two in the morning and get [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3929.44s)]
*  like eggs. Where are we? We're on the Upper West Side. Okay. And I had like a couple of meated [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3934.0s)]
*  friends who I think had done this once before. And I was uncomfortable with it, but they're like, [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3939.36s)]
*  we got to do it. It was really stupid because we go to that place all the time. So like, I think [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3944.2400000000002s)]
*  the idea is like, we were going to end up paying these people anyway at some point. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3949.44s)]
*  Let's just say like we all run out. The guy who chases us decides to follow me. Oh no. I was fast. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3954.08s)]
*  I thought they'd go after the slower guys, but I think he wanted to go after the faster guy. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3960.48s)]
*  Oh no. And he like kicked my ass. Oh no, really? He drop kicked me. Like he fucking drop kicked me. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3964.16s)]
*  Which literally kicked you in the ass. Literally kicked me in the ass. Okay. I was like, I'm sorry, [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3970.24s)]
*  it wasn't my idea. Here's money. Like, you know, and you know what? Good. Good. Good on that guy. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3974.48s)]
*  Lesson learned. Yeah. I, you know, I like my brief career in, you know, petty whatever, [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3979.44s)]
*  you know, the, the, the $5 I owed for this eggs and hash browns I paid and, and I deserved it. So [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3987.04s)]
*  like good, good on that guy for kicking my ass. Literally. I'm trying to think if I ever died [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3993.68s)]
*  in Dash. I don't think I ever did. I have a really well-developed sense of guilt and I'm not that [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=3997.2s)]
*  fast. I was pained with guilt. Like just, I remember feeling guilty before this even happened. So [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=4003.12s)]
*  I was like secretly, I think felt like I got what I deserve when this guy was literally drop kicking [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=4009.44s)]
*  me. Have you ever been to the grocery store and they sell like lemon looking, uh, plastic things [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=4014.3199999999997s)]
*  that squeeze out lemon juice? Yes, of course. I remember for some reason I was like six or seven, [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=4020.16s)]
*  I went to the grocery store with my mom. I stole one of those. We got home and she was like, where [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=4024.16s)]
*  the hell did you get that? And I was like, I stole it. She threw me right back in the car and we [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=4028.56s)]
*  returned it. So I think that was an early terrifying lesson. I had to do that once with [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=4032.48s)]
*  my daughter because she, when she was like two, she would ride in that cart and she just, I guess [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=4036.56s)]
*  had grabbed a lime and was just like holding it and I get out in the parking lot. I'm like, [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=4041.36s)]
*  wait, I don't think we pay for that lime, you know, like, yeah, we got to the rule. I did return it. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=4045.04s)]
*  But you eat it in the store. It's okay. Yeah. It's, it's a, it's a reminder. I guess, you know, [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=4049.36s)]
*  the produce is easy to swipe if you're too, you know, and I think we returned it. The person was [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=4054.0s)]
*  like, I don't give a shit. Yeah. I don't know. Roach brothers, what are we doing? Although the [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=4059.28s)]
*  air one in Venice, that lime probably costs like five bucks. 400. So I returned it. I returned it [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=4063.76s)]
*  to God. Hell, if you try to go to an air one in this city and you make a smoothie with a couple [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=4068.88s)]
*  different parts to it, you're paying $200. Anyway, enough about LA problems. That's it for us this [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=4073.1200000000003s)]
*  week. Talk to you guys next week. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC8hYetX5AA&t=4080.6400000000003s)]
