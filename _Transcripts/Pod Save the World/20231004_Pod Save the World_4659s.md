# Are Kevin McCarthy & Republicans Killing U.S. Military Support for Ukraine?
**Pod Save the World:** [October 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w)
*  Welcome to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Ben Rhodes. Ben, the house speakership is vacant [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=0.0s)]
*  or something. I don't, I barely listened, but bye-bye Kevin McCarthy. Yeah, the Kevin McCarthy era [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=6.32s)]
*  will be long remembered in American political history. What an era it was. Did you have a [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=12.08s)]
*  favorite part? Which month, which day was your favorite part? I mean, I, at the beginning, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=17.04s)]
*  the drama. Yeah. The beginning and the end. That was the only good part. The comeback. Yeah, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=24.0s)]
*  the beginning and the end is the only thing anybody's going to remember, which is a sad [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=28.32s)]
*  and sorry state of affairs for our country, but not feeling too bad for that guy. No, I have to [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=32.96s)]
*  say terrible, terrible, terrible person. And I'm sure he'll run again like 15 times. Well, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  do you remember my favorite thing is like that book, that really cheesy book. It's worth people [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=42.64s)]
*  Googling just to see that the cover of the book, Young Guns with Kevin McCarthy, Paul Ryan, and [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  Eric Cantor on the cover. All three of those guys have now had, I mean, we may not have heard the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=53.6s)]
*  last McCarthy, but he's definitely been assimilated as fully as those other guys now. Yeah. It's funny [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=59.92s)]
*  that the Heritage Foundation tax cuts for businesses, generation Republicans didn't make it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  So Ben, we got a lot to cover today. We're going to talk about this mess in the house, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=70.32s)]
*  the representatives and what it means for Ukraine aid, both in the U S and also just the politics [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=74.56s)]
*  in Europe. There's reports about Russia testing a nuclear powered missile. So that's really fun. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=79.28s)]
*  Elon Musk took a little sojourn to the border. Donald Trump is waging war with his own senior [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=85.12s)]
*  military leadership. There is a rare breakthrough for Haiti. The India's war of words with Canada [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=90.64s)]
*  is getting nastier and nastier. And then we'll talk a little panda diplomacy. And then I just [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=96.72s)]
*  spoke with former CIA officer Sumi Terry about North Korea and a new documentary called Beyond [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=101.68s)]
*  Utopia, which is about life in North Korea and what people will do to escape it. It is [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=108.56s)]
*  really a powerful film. Ben, it's like, I don't like it. It kind of fucked me up for many, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  many hours because when you kind of like, you live in the shoes of someone who is, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=121.2s)]
*  I don't know, in North Korea for decades, brainwashed for 80 years. You know, you watch [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  this family like desperately go through four different countries to escape it. It really [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=130.32s)]
*  affects you. But an amazing film that opens in theaters later this month that folks should check [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=134.48s)]
*  out. I think I spent the evening of the Donald Trump Kim Jong-un summit in a television studio [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=138.56s)]
*  with Sumi Terry. Oh, really? Former CIA? Yeah. And what was interesting is she, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=147.92s)]
*  watching somebody who'd worked on that issue for a lot of her life react to the images of Donald [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=155.6s)]
*  Trump kind of sucking up to Kim Jong-un, I thought she was going to pass out, but she's very good. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=161.44s)]
*  Yeah. We talked about this in the interview. The entire conversation in Washington is about [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=169.44s)]
*  North Korea's nuclear weapons program, understandably on some level. But when you really [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=173.76s)]
*  look at their human rights violations, the only example that's comparable is Nazi Germany. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=178.24s)]
*  And that's who you're sending love letters to and sucking up to and meeting up with in Singapore [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=184.72s)]
*  and talking about how brilliant he is. I mean, that is the context for Trump kissing this guy's [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=189.52s)]
*  ass for four years. Yeah. I mean, I think people live in a hellscape that we can't even imagine. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=194.08s)]
*  The stories of defectors who didn't even know, reached teenage years and didn't even know about [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=199.68s)]
*  holding hands. They didn't even know about the basic forms of human connection that people have [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  because they're so beaten into submission to this bizarre cult of personality. It's [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=213.36s)]
*  truly dark stuff that doesn't get enough of a spotlight. So I'm glad you're doing that. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=219.04s)]
*  Yeah. It's worth checking out. Again, it's called Beyond Utopia. Ben, let's start with Ukraine [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=223.28s)]
*  because everyone's trying to figure out what this mess in the House of Representatives over the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=228.88s)]
*  spending bills means for US support for Ukraine. We talked about some of the domestic politics a [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=232.08s)]
*  bit on Pod Save America yesterday. I figured you and I, because look, let's be honest, we're a [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=236.96s)]
*  little more worldly. We're a little more sophisticated. We should broaden it out and [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=240.72s)]
*  talk about Europe too. The Wall Street Journal says that the Pentagon has about $5 billion left [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=243.52s)]
*  in its coffers for Ukraine. That is until some accounting error finds like an F-35 and a couch [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=251.44s)]
*  cushion or something. But that $5 billion is going to last a couple of months and then they [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=256.8s)]
*  got to figure out what's next. President Biden wants Congress to pass another $24 billion. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  Again, that money will pay for the Javelin missiles, tanks, artillery shells, et cetera. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=266.0s)]
*  To date, the US has provided $74 billion in humanitarian budget and military support to Ukraine. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=271.04s)]
*  If you're seeing bigger numbers in the press being reported, I know it's confusing, but that money [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=277.12s)]
*  probably includes money the US spent to replenish our own stockpiles. That's why you're seeing like [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=281.68s)]
*  $114, $115. Since the war started, the EU and member states have given Ukraine about $80 billion. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=285.76s)]
*  The UK has done about $6 billion on top of that. Europe is doing a lot for Ukraine, but there's no [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=291.52s)]
*  way they could cover the shortfall if the US cuts off funding. You and I have talked about how [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=295.84s)]
*  political support for Ukraine funding has eroded in the US, especially among Republicans. That's [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=300.4s)]
*  also happening in Europe. A couple of data points in Slovakia. A pro-Russian candidate named Robert [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=305.76s)]
*  Fico, his SMER party, got more votes in their parliamentary elections than any other party. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  He still needs to form a coalition, but this guy blamed Ukrainian Nazis and fascists. That's a [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=317.03999999999996s)]
*  quote for the invasion. It promised to cut off military support. Poland had been very forward [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=322.0s)]
*  leaning in supporting Ukraine, but the ruling law and justice party is waffling a bit in advance of [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=327.6s)]
*  their election on October 15th. Farmers in Poland are pissed about Ukrainian grain imports under [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=332.32s)]
*  cutting prices and the law and justice party is fending off an even more right-wing party that's [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=337.76s)]
*  running against support for Ukraine. On top of all that, Europe just like doesn't have the industrial [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=342.08s)]
*  base they need. Again, the Wall Street Journal, a great piece on this, they said industry officials [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=346.48s)]
*  say that Europe's defense industry currently can collectively only produce 5% to 10% of the artillery [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=350.64s)]
*  ammunition Ukraine needs. So Ben, foreign ministers from most European countries had a surprise [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=356.24s)]
*  meeting in Ukraine this week. They're trying to show solidarity, but the political trajectory [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=364.56s)]
*  across the US, across Europe, feels very, very bad. I'm wondering what the way through this is [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=370.47999999999996s)]
*  that doesn't leave Ukraine hanging. Yeah, I think you said the key word, which is trajectory, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=376.72s)]
*  right? Which is that there is no place right now in the world where the trend line is in the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=381.44000000000005s)]
*  direction of providing more support for Ukraine. The trend line in European politics is the rise [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=388.56s)]
*  of kind of populists who are kind of merging a message against the cost of living crisis [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=395.36s)]
*  with a message against support for Ukraine. And that's a trend line in the Republican party in [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=400.24s)]
*  the US, which is enough to throw wrenches into the gears of providing continued funding. So [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=404.4s)]
*  there are different pieces of this, right? In the US, it's just going to be a real Herculane task [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=410.15999999999997s)]
*  to get even this 24 billion out the door. I think they'll get there, Tommy. There's enough [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=416.15999999999997s)]
*  end of year funding. They're going to have to kind of have some massive funding bill at some point to [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=422.23999999999995s)]
*  avert another government shutdown. And I can't imagine that the White House and even some [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=426.96s)]
*  Senate Republicans like Mitch McConnell would let that go through without something like this [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=432.56s)]
*  funding getting through. However, I think the message is, given how hard it is, getting more [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=437.36s)]
*  of that funding before our election is going to be really, really difficult. And given the burn [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=443.04s)]
*  rate thus far, it's not clear to me that 24 billion even gets you to that election. So the American [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=447.2s)]
*  funding is in trouble. The European funding is in real trouble too. And as you have more of these [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=452.64s)]
*  elections, the thing people may say like, well, Slovakia is not that big a supplier to Ukraine. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=458.96s)]
*  Well, in addition to being the most forward leaning, one of the more forward leaning countries early [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=465.52s)]
*  in the war in terms of providing support, they've also, you know, when other political leaders see [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=469.84s)]
*  results like that in their neighborhood, they might start to get a little cautious too. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=476.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah. We'll come back to the Kyiv meeting because it's interesting that the EU did what [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=480.64s)]
*  they did. I think it's in part an effort to kind of signal ongoing support, but we have to face the [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=485.28s)]
*  reality that it's going to get harder to provide this support. Certainly not easier. And look, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=490.47999999999996s)]
*  I think part of what happened here, Tommy, we talked a lot about this, you know, while we were [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=497.11999999999995s)]
*  waiting for this counteroffensive, that the expectations were raised too high, I think, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=501.91999999999996s)]
*  by some of the Ukrainian supporters, that this counteroffensive was going to be decisive, that [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=506.55999999999995s)]
*  victory was near hand. That word was used a lot, victory, victory, victory, victory, without much [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=511.04s)]
*  definition of what that meant. And Ukraine has been losing so many people and burning through [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=516.16s)]
*  such ammunition. And if this really is settling into more of an war of attrition, it may be that [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=522.8000000000001s)]
*  that kind of, I don't want to say burn rate because there are human lives attached to that, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=529.12s)]
*  but that level of effort, it may not just, it may not be sustainable. Ukraine may need to shift to [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=532.8000000000001s)]
*  a strategy that is more opportunistic, that is not kind of throwing so much at the front lines [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=539.2s)]
*  at the same time. They may have to account for the fact that there is going to just by definition be [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=544.72s)]
*  a slightly lower flow of weapons and money to them. I don't think it's going to be cut off in any form, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=551.0400000000001s)]
*  nor do I think it should, obviously. But I do think that we're just in a new reality here, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=556.8000000000001s)]
*  assuming this counteroffensive doesn't break through. Thus far, they've only taken back, I think, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=561.6s)]
*  0.25% of the land that Russia held before the counteroffensive began here. So that's what we're [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=566.4s)]
*  talking about. It's a very marginal amount of territorial gain. Assuming that's kind of where [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=571.4399999999999s)]
*  things are as we enter the winter, I just think they're going to have to account for less of a [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=575.4399999999999s)]
*  spigot of assistance coming in. That's just the reality, unless something can shift politics. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=581.4399999999999s)]
*  But I don't think anything can truly shift politics in the West on this issue until the [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=586.0799999999999s)]
*  U.S. presidential election. And then look, if Biden's re-elected, then maybe there's another [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=590.64s)]
*  push here. We're talking about a year from now, but that's just where we are. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=594.8s)]
*  Yeah. And Biden did a call today with a bunch of allies trying to reassure them. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=598.56s)]
*  But we also have to remember that it's October 3rd. Last winter was unseasonably warm. That [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=602.9599999999999s)]
*  helped keep some of those political forces from, like a cost of living increasing or people flipping [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=610.56s)]
*  out about their heating bills or driving sentiment against the war. We just don't know that's going [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=616.3199999999999s)]
*  to be the case. So much of this is out of our hands. And to your point, the Ukrainian forces [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=621.28s)]
*  have breached a couple of these defensive lines that the Russians have set up, but they haven't [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=626.8s)]
*  busted through them yet or really sort of picked up a lot of territory. And I don't know if that's a [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=632.64s)]
*  fair way to judge this counteroffensive or not, but it sort of was the benchmark that got set up. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=637.92s)]
*  And it's what the conversation has been in this expert analyst community. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=643.12s)]
*  Yeah. And I don't think it's the fair benchmark, but again, the reality is like, this is why [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=647.04s)]
*  I think we had these concerns about how high the expectations are getting raised on the [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=651.5999999999999s)]
*  counteroffensive. And look, the arguments that are being made in European politics that you heard in [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=655.5999999999999s)]
*  Slovakia, that the AFD party, the kind of Nazi party in Germany, which is again, as we always say, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=661.76s)]
*  not a good thing. Rising in support fast, by the way, the AFD popularity is drastically increasing. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=667.68s)]
*  That's right. And their message is we're paying for this three ways in Europe. We're paying for [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=673.52s)]
*  it because we're paying for refugees, we're paying for it in the price of energy, and we're paying [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=677.92s)]
*  for it with assistance. And look, I think that they're wrong. And look, I think it's worth [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=682.24s)]
*  just noting that what the Republicans are doing with this is cynical and wrong. But there is, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=690.0s)]
*  you can't ignore the political salience of that message. And so I think you have to look for [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=696.3199999999999s)]
*  ways to shift the Ukrainian military strategy, ways to maybe focus on some of the more [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=701.52s)]
*  consequential systems, rather than trying to give them everything, focus on what is most important. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=706.48s)]
*  So for instance, if we're moving to more of an war of attrition, maybe they need more air defense [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=711.36s)]
*  systems, right? So that their life can be normal in the parts of Ukraine that are not controlled by [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=715.6s)]
*  Russia. I think what the Europeans did with this kind of meeting of foreign ministers in Kiev was [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=720.88s)]
*  really smart, because what they were saying is, we're here to talk about Ukraine's trajectory into [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=725.6s)]
*  the European Union. And that's kind of a long term vision for where this is going. People say like, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=730.64s)]
*  well, where's this all going? It's pretty clear that Ukraine is probably gonna have a hard time [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=734.96s)]
*  regaining all of its territories, certainly so long as Vladimir Putin's around. You have to [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=738.96s)]
*  start to piece together a five year and a 10 year vision here for how Ukraine can sustain itself, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=743.76s)]
*  how life can be protected in the parts of Ukraine that, again, are not under Russian control, how [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=748.4s)]
*  budgetary support can continue to flow in, how reforms can continue to happen in Ukraine so that [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=754.16s)]
*  they can join the European Union over time. So I think you have to kind of broaden the lens here [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=758.96s)]
*  of the types of political and economic and military support you're providing, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=765.6800000000001s)]
*  instead of just trying to rack up as much military support and as many weapon systems as [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=769.84s)]
*  possible. It's gonna have to be a little more focused, a little more targeted, and coupled [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=775.6s)]
*  with other types of policies that try to just help the Ukrainians weather a war of attrition, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=780.1600000000001s)]
*  rather than thinking, you know what, if we give them a few more tanks and some F-16s, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=786.24s)]
*  the next counter offensive is gonna be the one that breaks the line, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=790.24s)]
*  because it's just not clear that we can count on that. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=793.84s)]
*  Everybody's got to stop with this magic bullet next weapon system bullshit. That's just not the [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=796.16s)]
*  way it works. Adding to the fun, speaking of weapon systems, Ben, the New York Times reported that [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=800.32s)]
*  Russia has tested, or is maybe planning to test a nuclear powered missile. This is based on satellite [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=804.24s)]
*  imagery showing movement at a base previously associated with testing of the SSC X-9 Skyfall [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=809.76s)]
*  missile. I wouldn't be too worried about this one, since I think previous tests have all failed, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=815.6s)]
*  but you know, not great. Kind of an alarmist headline. Also, this week marks the sixth month [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=820.08s)]
*  that Wall Street Journal reporter, Evan Kurskovich, has been detained, or held hostage rather, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=826.24s)]
*  in Russia. So I just want to add us to the chorus of people who are thinking about him and hoping [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=831.36s)]
*  he gets released soon. Yeah, never good when there's like nuclear [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=835.12s)]
*  cruise missile tests happening, even when they fail. It's just a kind of reminder that we're in [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=838.72s)]
*  this kind of very dangerous era because Putin keeps messaging, he keeps trying to remind people [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=844.0s)]
*  that he has this nuclear escalation card to play. What we've learned is he's not playing it just [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=852.48s)]
*  because the Ukrainians are taking some shots into Crimea and things like that. But that doesn't [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=857.52s)]
*  mean we shouldn't be concerned because what people should remember is the entire nuclear arms control [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=861.76s)]
*  regime between the US and Russia has kind of fallen apart. Trump pulled out of a bunch of, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=866.48s)]
*  it wasn't just the Russians, Trump pulled out of some of these treaties. The Russians aren't [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=871.68s)]
*  cooperating with the New START treaty that applies to the deployed missile launchers for nuclear [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=874.88s)]
*  weapons. So this testing is happening without the kind of arms control regime that we've had in place [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=880.9599999999999s)]
*  for decades dating back into the Cold War. And that's just a more dangerous world, right? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=887.12s)]
*  So that's unfortunately where we are. Yeah. So obviously, Ukraine will be a big issue going [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=892.4s)]
*  forward and then the likely race between Biden and Donald Trump. Another big one will be [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=897.04s)]
*  immigration. We've covered the migration crisis a lot on the show. On Monday, President Lopez [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=902.24s)]
*  Obrador of Mexico gave a speech where he said that 6,000 migrants are entering southern Mexico per day. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=909.4399999999999s)]
*  And he said last week, 10,000 migrants reached the US Mexico border per day. So the flows are [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=915.28s)]
*  drastically increasing after a decrease for a while. Lopez Obrador, AMLO and the Colombian [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=920.64s)]
*  president, Gustavo Petro, both came out and blamed US sanctions on Venezuela and Cuba [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=927.1199999999999s)]
*  for driving migration. I think a more fair assessment would be its policies in those [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=933.4399999999999s)]
*  countries plus US sanctions that are driving the crisis. But you're hearing a chorus of these [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=938.2399999999999s)]
*  concerns out of South America. But don't worry, Ben, because help is on the way. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=944.2399999999999s)]
*  Elon Musk grabbed his cowboy hat and his boots and decided to head down to the border to, I guess, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=950.4s)]
*  learn about it for the first time to test out Twitter's live streaming capabilities. Along [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=957.04s)]
*  the way, he tweeted a bunch of helpful shit like, quote, we actually do need a wall and we need [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=961.68s)]
*  people to have some shred of evidence to claim asylum to enter. Thank you, Elon. No one else knew [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=966.0799999999999s)]
*  that. He also said, why do so many American politicians from both parties care 100 times [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=970.88s)]
*  more about the Ukraine border than the USA border? Because this billionaire genius can't [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=976.56s)]
*  comprehend that immigration policy is different than getting invaded by the Russian army. But Ben, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=982.72s)]
*  you have confidence that Elon is going to solve the problem down there one live stream at a time? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=989.12s)]
*  Where was Elon Musk born, Tommy? I forgot. South Africa, I believe. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=992.96s)]
*  Really? So he wasn't born in the United States? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=996.48s)]
*  No, I believe he's a migrant, one might say. Yeah, he's not from here. He had the opportunity [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=999.12s)]
*  to come here and build with heavy government subsidies, I might add, a very successful career. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1004.72s)]
*  I mean, look, I'll come back to Elon in a second here. But I will say, like, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1010.48s)]
*  clearly two of the five, I mean, you're more plugged in to the presidential politics than I am, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1016.48s)]
*  but it seems like two of the five kind of, insofar as policies matter in presidential election, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1021.68s)]
*  Ukraine and the border are two that are going to be, you know, front of mind for people through [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1028.16s)]
*  the election year. And I say this with sympathy for the Biden administration. But I do think that [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1034.4s)]
*  on both of those issues, President Biden needs to do more to kind of spell out, where does this end, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1040.4s)]
*  or where is this going? You know, I think right now, they're in that place that we've been in, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1047.76s)]
*  Tommy, when we were in government. Sometimes you get stuck in a place where people are looking at [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1052.24s)]
*  your big ticket items, and they're like, where is this war going in Ukraine? We're shipping all this [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1055.44s)]
*  money over there, all these weapons, all these Ukrainians are dying, and there's a front line [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1060.56s)]
*  that's not moving. And they're looking at the border, and they're seeing the numbers rising. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1064.0s)]
*  And so I think, you know, in Ukraine, there has to be an effort to begin to describe, and they've [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1067.6000000000001s)]
*  been reluctant to do this because of not wanting to get ahead of the Ukrainians. He's going to have [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1070.88s)]
*  to start to talk about how does this end. And just saying we're in this for as long as it takes, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1075.28s)]
*  I'm not sure that's like a message that the electorate is going to want to hear exactly. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1080.24s)]
*  John Kirby got pressed on this today at the podium then. He's like, isn't this just another forever [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1085.04s)]
*  war? And like, that's, it's not, right? It's different. It's not the like, a 20-year-old war [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1088.64s)]
*  on terror. But when you say we'll be there as long as it takes, it sure sounds like one, you know, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1095.1200000000001s)]
*  to your point. If your message for how this ends is we're there as long as it takes, and the front [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1099.68s)]
*  line's not moving, that's just not going to work politically. And so there has to be some discussion [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1103.68s)]
*  of an end state in Ukraine, where this is going, or what is the sustainable level of support. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1109.6000000000001s)]
*  And on the border, like, he's going to have to go out and yeah, I think he has to put forward like [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1113.6s)]
*  a comprehensive set of policies that describes like, what are we doing with border security? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1118.8s)]
*  What are we doing with migrants who are here? How do we bring more order to the asylum process? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1122.9599999999998s)]
*  But also importantly, I'm not going to agree with Petro. Like, sure, you can't blame the US only, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1128.0s)]
*  but I think President Biden going out and saying we are going to, you know, suspend these sanctions. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1133.52s)]
*  You know, Cuba doesn't need to be on the state sponsor of terrorism list. They're not a state [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1139.6s)]
*  sponsor of terrorism. Some of the more comprehensive sanctions on the entire Venezuelan economy, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1142.96s)]
*  these things are pushing migrants to our borders. They're making life worse in these countries. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1148.08s)]
*  We should be laying out that we're doing everything we can to slow the flow of migrants to our [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1152.64s)]
*  borders. So I think putting out a kind of comprehensive vision for how you're going to [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1157.04s)]
*  deal with the border, starting with the factors that are driving people here, including US sanctions, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1160.88s)]
*  and dealing with things in this country as a part of it. Now, Elon Musk, I'll also discuss in the [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1165.3600000000001s)]
*  context of this election because he sounds more that line about why are we defending the Ukrainian [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1171.84s)]
*  border and not our border. We use that line. Marjorie Taylor Greene used that line like a [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1176.6399999999999s)]
*  year ago, and I think we played the clip on this podcast. That's where Elon's at. And we're now [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1182.8s)]
*  entering a period where we know the Russians have every incentive for Joe Biden to lose and Donald [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1187.6799999999998s)]
*  Trump to win. We know from recent reporting that has been put out that China now seems to be playing [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1192.48s)]
*  in our politics against Joe Biden, and that means for Donald Trump. And then we know the guy that [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1198.64s)]
*  controls one of the biggest platforms that those countries might use, that he also seems to be kind [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1203.6000000000001s)]
*  of where they're at on these things too. The deck is stacked pretty heavily in terms of foreign [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1210.4s)]
*  influence or tech bro influence in this election. It's pretty decisively against Joe Biden. This is [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1216.96s)]
*  a big problem. This is a big piece of this election cycle. And I don't know that we have an answer [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1224.1599999999999s)]
*  for what you do with an unaccountable guy with over a hundred billion dollars. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1229.84s)]
*  People spend a lot of time going through Biden's speeches, talking about his surrogates, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1232.4799999999998s)]
*  what his message should be. We spend a lot less time talking about that kind of last mile issue [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1237.9199999999998s)]
*  of how you get a message to people that aren't focused on politics. And Twitter is a piece of [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1242.56s)]
*  that. A lot of these technology companies are a piece of that. And you're right that things are [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1247.36s)]
*  stacked firmly against Joe Biden here. But by the way, Ben, one piece of progress. So last week, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1251.2s)]
*  we talked about the corruption allegations against Senator Bob Menendez, the former now chairman of [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1255.76s)]
*  the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Our hope was that getting rid of Menendez might actually [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1261.1200000000001s)]
*  help President Biden have the political space to get rid of some hard line sanctions against [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1265.3600000000001s)]
*  Venezuela or Cuba, some things that we've long talked about, thought were stupid. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1270.72s)]
*  So Menendez, remember, was accused of helping the Egyptian government get military aid in exchange [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1274.48s)]
*  for bribes. So Ben Cardin, the new chairman, came in and he put a hold on military aid to Egypt. So [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1280.16s)]
*  Ben Cardin, shaking some stuff up here. We've got a little progress already. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1286.88s)]
*  Yeah. No, I guess no gold bars for Ben Cardin and his family. Look, this is overdue. A real look at [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1289.92s)]
*  U.S. citizens to Egypt, given the abysmal human rights circumstances there. I'm glad he's doing [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1299.76s)]
*  it. Ben Cardin has also in the past favored engagement with Cuba. So I really do think [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1305.04s)]
*  there's an opportunity that the Biden administration absolutely should take here to change course on [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1311.04s)]
*  Venezuela and Cuba. I'd like to see them do some of the same on Egypt as well. We'll see if they [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1318.32s)]
*  take it. Yeah. So Ben, the other big political fight that's happening is Trump against his [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1324.08s)]
*  former staff, especially former senior members of the military. I literally can't remember if [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1329.04s)]
*  you and I talked about the Mark Milley stuff, which just tells you a lot about the Trump news [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1334.72s)]
*  cycle. But for a reminder, Trump suggested that the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Mark Milley, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1337.92s)]
*  should be executed for treason. Here's a clip of General Milley responding to Trump's comments on [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1343.1200000000001s)]
*  60 Minutes. He is suggesting that you be punished by death, the former commander in chief to his [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1349.28s)]
*  former top military advisor. Look, I'm a soldier. I've been faithful and loyal to the Constitution [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1355.68s)]
*  of the United States for 44 and a half years. And my family and I have sacrificed greatly for this [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1361.2s)]
*  country, my mother and father before them. And, you know, as much as these comments directed at me, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1366.64s)]
*  it's also directed at the institution of the military. And there's 2.1 million of us in uniform. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1373.28s)]
*  And the American people can take it to the bank that all of us, every single one of us, from private [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1379.76s)]
*  to general, we're loyal to that Constitution and we'll never turn our back on it no matter what. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1384.16s)]
*  God damn, that guy's got a great voice. He should do like a smooth jazz kind of late night show. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1388.0s)]
*  Ben, on the radio, also later in his speech Milley said, quote, we are unique among the world's [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1393.12s)]
*  militaries. We don't take an oath to a country. We don't take an oath to a tribe. We don't take [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1397.6s)]
*  an oath to a religion. We don't take an oath to a king or a queen or a tyrant or a dictator. Now, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1401.76s)]
*  the civility police came out in response to that and questioned whether it was appropriate for [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1407.44s)]
*  someone in uniform to make these kind of comments. I would say defense of the civility police, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1412.72s)]
*  a lot of us criticized General Milley when he walked out into Lafayette Square with Trump when [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1418.0s)]
*  they were clearing Black Lives Matter protesters. But what did you make of Milley's comments here [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1423.44s)]
*  and whether or not it's appropriate for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs to make those [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1428.72s)]
*  while still in the job? Yeah, I'd like a red hand alert here on this one, Tommy. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1431.6s)]
*  It's coming. I'm totally... I have no patience with civility police in this, right? Because I [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1435.2s)]
*  saw some of this stuff. I saw some people really wringing their hands about this and this is, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1443.44s)]
*  oh my God, this is so terrible. And the Wall Street Journal writing editorials about [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1450.3200000000002s)]
*  General Milley's falling into the trap of violating norms just like Trump and everything. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1456.16s)]
*  Well, let's just look at what he said. He said that we don't take an oath to want to be dictators. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1460.96s)]
*  Is there anything factually inaccurate about that? You know what I mean? It's a sign of how much Trump [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1469.44s)]
*  has infected everybody's brain that that statement is somehow controversial. You know what I mean? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1476.32s)]
*  If he had said something like, Donald Trump can go fuck himself or, well, I guess that would be in [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1484.56s)]
*  a pretty extreme version. But if he had said something that couldn't be pulled out and [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1489.76s)]
*  totally defended, that'd be one thing. But the reason I really have no problem with it is, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1495.36s)]
*  where I might disagree with Milley, right? And this is not to impugn anybody in the military. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1504.8799999999999s)]
*  But I think he's right that Donald Trump is talking about the whole military here because [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1511.12s)]
*  Donald Trump is also kind of dog whistling all the time to the MAGA heads in the military, I think. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1516.3999999999999s)]
*  And when Milley says all 2.1 million of us agree about this, well, I don't know. And I think what [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1523.2s)]
*  Milley's doing in those remarks is his audience is the military. And he's saying to people, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1530.96s)]
*  including some people that might be Trump supporters, hey, remember, you take an oath to [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1536.16s)]
*  the Constitution. And I think that's not just a political message in our politics. I think that's [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1540.3200000000002s)]
*  an important message for the military to reaffirm to its own people. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1546.0s)]
*  It's a statement of principle. It's not a political attack. He's not saying like Donald [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1548.72s)]
*  Trump's a corrupt hack and fuck that guy. He's saying like, I swore an oath to the Constitution. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1551.92s)]
*  Like, if you view that as a political attack, the recipient of that message is the problem in my book. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1556.3200000000002s)]
*  That is exactly my point. That is exactly right, Tommy. Like, if it's political to say [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1562.24s)]
*  that we take an oath to the Constitution, not a dictator, then we've got bigger problems here. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1567.44s)]
*  OK? And I think it is important for senior military officers to message to the US military to remind [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1572.16s)]
*  them that we take an oath to the Constitution. And that's what Milley, I think, regrets about [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1579.44s)]
*  the walk he made across the law. Is that that was about Trump and not the Constitution. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1584.24s)]
*  So on this one, I don't know. Like, I don't see why that's a problem. Particularly, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1589.2s)]
*  I give the guy the benefit of the doubt after Trump threatened to execute him. You know, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1594.3200000000002s)]
*  like the guy's allowed to speak his mind a little bit. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1598.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. So the other sort of strand of this, Ben, is during the Trump years, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1602.4s)]
*  there were lots of reports about really shockingly disrespectful things Trump said [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1605.44s)]
*  about the military. Usually they were in the Atlantic. Thanks to Jeff Goldberg. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1609.92s)]
*  So a lot of these comments were sourced to Trump officials on background. Now Trump's former chief [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1614.24s)]
*  of staff, John Kelly, has decided to come forward and confirm all these stories on the record. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1619.68s)]
*  So Kelly, you remember, was the commander of US Southern Command during the Obama administration. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1625.2s)]
*  He was a four-star general, a combatant commander. Then he took a job as Trump's [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1630.3999999999999s)]
*  secretary of homeland security. Then he took the job of chief of staff. So John Kelly confirmed on [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1634.96s)]
*  the record to CNN's Jake Tapper the following previously reported stories and anecdotes. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1640.24s)]
*  One, that Trump, while touring Section 60 at Arlington National Cemetery on Memorial Day in [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1645.84s)]
*  2017, said, quote, I don't get it. What's in it for them? Remember, Section 60 is where service [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1650.8799999999999s)]
*  members killed in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, presumably including John Kelly's son, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1656.48s)]
*  who stepped on a mine in Afghanistan and was killed. Second, that behind closed doors, [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1662.48s)]
*  Trump called John McCain and President George H.W. Bush losers. No surprise there. He said that in [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1668.72s)]
*  public all the time. And then there was that trip to France Trump took where he refused to visit a [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1673.3600000000001s)]
*  cemetery where service members killed in World War I were buried, saying, quote, why should I [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1678.0s)]
*  go to that cemetery? It's filled with losers. And then there was the anecdote that Trump said [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1682.88s)]
*  he didn't want wounded veterans in this military parade that he wanted because, quote, it doesn't [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1688.3200000000002s)]
*  look good for me. So Ben, it was obvious all along that John Kelly was the source for these stories [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1693.68s)]
*  because they were like one-on-one conversations. It had to be. I'm glad he put it on the record. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1699.6000000000001s)]
*  I don't totally get why he waited till now. I'm guessing he was really mad about what Trump said [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1704.88s)]
*  about Milley. But like, look, I know, like, I'm of two minds of this, right? I'm glad he said this. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1708.88s)]
*  But also, hey, John Kelly, Trump's disrespect for the military was clear before you decided to leave [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1714.5600000000002s)]
*  your job in the military to take two political roles in the administration, right? But I guess [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1720.88s)]
*  the question is, do you think that Milley and now John Kelly come out? Like, can this move the needle [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1727.2s)]
*  at all among service members' support for Trump? I don't think so on its own right. But I do [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1732.3200000000002s)]
*  think that it could, if there's real effort put behind this message over the course of next year. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1738.96s)]
*  So first of all, I'm with you after totally defending what Milley said. I find this whole [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1744.24s)]
*  John Kelly thing kind of bizarre because as you and I probably follow this closer than most people [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1750.24s)]
*  because we had to deal a lot with the press and with Jeff Goldberg. And as you said, when [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1756.8799999999999s)]
*  there's conversations where there's only one other person there in a background quote, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1762.08s)]
*  it was clear it was John Kelly all along. And what was also weird is that in the interview with Jake [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1767.76s)]
*  Tapper, he literally said like verbatim the things that were in the Jeff Goldberg article [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1773.04s)]
*  in 2020. So it's weird. It was like he was reading his own background quotes and onto the record. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1778.24s)]
*  And it's like, dude, especially after you took political jobs, because Milley, I think we had [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1784.3999999999999s)]
*  to remember, did not take a political job. He was still in uniform. He was still just moving up [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1789.68s)]
*  as chairman. John Kelly took off the uniform to go into the White House. So he kind of had an [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1794.0s)]
*  extra obligation, I think, to come out and tell people what he knew. So I just find it all very [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1798.0s)]
*  strange. I don't quite understand the calculus of these people like Kelly and Mattis who make these [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1803.2s)]
*  kind of strange veiled comments sometimes in public. And then they show up clearly on background and [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1811.2s)]
*  like Jeff Goldberg stories where Jeff Goldberg, who is a friend of this pod, but he pops up now [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1816.08s)]
*  every few months with stories that are just about US generals who don't like Trump. He's [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1821.2s)]
*  kind of on this beat. Listen, I respect these guys. I respect that there's honor and not getting [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1824.72s)]
*  involved in politics and sort of how they view the world. But on some level, it's like, guys, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1829.76s)]
*  if you're going to get drunk with Jeff Goldberg at the Aspen Security Forum and cough up a bunch [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1833.68s)]
*  of stories on background, just say it on the record. Also, Ben, did you catch this part of [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1838.16s)]
*  Kelly's quote? He said to Tapper, it just seems like Kelly got ripshit and Tapper is a really [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1842.64s)]
*  good reporter. We've probably reached out to him and he just got this amazing scoop. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1848.32s)]
*  He's also friends with Jeff Goldberg, by the way, too, like they hang out. So like there's some [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1850.96s)]
*  weird circle there. But this was part of Kelly's quote, quote, a person who is not truthful [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1854.48s)]
*  regarding his position on the protection of unborn life on women, on minorities, on evangelical [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1858.8s)]
*  Christians, on Jews, on working men and women. There's a lot to unpack there, John Kelly. What [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1864.0s)]
*  does any of that mean? What do you mean is not truthful about his position on Jews? What does [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1870.96s)]
*  that mean? I don't know, man. This is why John Kelly probably should not have gone into politics [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1875.92s)]
*  in the first place. I think, by the way, this is a very small, small-c conservative guy, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1883.8400000000001s)]
*  John Kelly. The unborn life thing is kind of a tell on that. I just, on your point about moving [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1888.72s)]
*  the needle though, I think that the Democrats or the anti-Trump coalition, whatever we want to call [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1893.76s)]
*  this, has to kind of tie a whole bunch of these things together, right? Trump's insults to the [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1899.68s)]
*  military, by the way, including like bizarrely World War I. That's my favorite one. Like what [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1905.92s)]
*  did those guys ever do? But Tommy Tuberville holding up all these appointments, right? [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1910.16s)]
*  Like Paul Gosar threatening to kill people in the military. There should be this concerted effort [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1917.2s)]
*  to kind of package this together and not just go on MSNBC and talk about it as people like me do, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1923.68s)]
*  you know, admittedly, but to go into these communities, to go to military, you know, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1930.96s)]
*  military communities, military families, VFWs, veterans messaging. Like there should be a massive [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1936.64s)]
*  effort to go into these places for the next year and be like, these people have no respect for the [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1942.8s)]
*  military. They have no respect for service. They have no respect for veterans. I've heard in talking [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1948.16s)]
*  to like Democratic politicians over the years, including, you know, people like, you know, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1952.32s)]
*  Conor Lamb, like a really great, you know, member of the House from Pennsylvania got elected in a [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1956.72s)]
*  special election after the Trump election. You know, that there are these voters that are Trump [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1962.32s)]
*  friendly voters, but they're veterans or they're in military families and they just, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1967.9199999999998s)]
*  they really don't like this. They have a sense of honor, you know? They are. They may hate the [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1973.6s)]
*  Democratic party and they may think we're all woke lunatics, but they really don't like this [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1977.28s)]
*  attack on kind of patriotism in the military. So I just, I hope that people, these are some of the [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1982.6399999999999s)]
*  only persuadable voters out there. And you have to package this together and not just assume that [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1988.96s)]
*  the Atlantic article or the MSNBC commentary is going to reach these people. You have to go to them [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1994.16s)]
*  and remind them of all these things. Absolutely right. Okay. Let's take a quick break. When we [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=1999.2s)]

*  major development for Haiti. So on Monday, the United Nations Security Council voted to approve [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2166.56s)]
*  a multinational year-long security mission for Haiti. This UN mission would be led by Kenya, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2171.2s)]
*  and their mission would be to guard critical infrastructure, ports, schools, conduct operations [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2177.52s)]
*  alongside the Haitian police against gangs. Remember, we've talked about this a bunch over [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2182.96s)]
*  the past few years. Gangs control much, if not all of Haiti, especially Port-au-Prince. Kidnapping [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2186.56s)]
*  for ransom is kind of a daily thing at this point. And things have gotten steadily worse [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2192.96s)]
*  since the president of Haiti was assassinated in 2021. And it's been too dangerous to hold elections, [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2197.44s)]
*  so there's no political leadership to speak of. Haiti's foreign minister called this UN vote, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2204.48s)]
*  quote, a glimmer of hope. The US has pledged about $200 million in support of the mission. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2210.32s)]
*  About a dozen countries said they're willing to join. So 13 members of the Security Council [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2215.76s)]
*  voted yes. Russia and China abstained, but they did not block it. So Ben, a few things here. First, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2220.4s)]
*  I kind of assumed that the Russian and China approach to the UN was like burn it down, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2228.56s)]
*  destroy it, render it inoperable in all its ways. So it was interesting to me to see them decide not [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2234.32s)]
*  to block this mission. It probably speaks to the fact that when voices in the Caribbean and Latin [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2241.04s)]
*  America and Africa are all saying, hey, we have prioritized something, that you can actually get [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2247.68s)]
*  them to move. Second, obviously there's a terrible history of foreign intervention in Haiti that [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2250.96s)]
*  everyone seems to be mindful of before getting too hopeful. There was direct US military intervention. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2256.64s)]
*  Everyone remembers the UN response to the earthquake, which led to this horrible [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2261.9199999999996s)]
*  cholera outbreak. And then Kenyan security forces, I think about a thousand of them will [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2265.8399999999997s)]
*  lead the mission. They have been accused of human rights violations. So that's something that I think [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2270.7999999999997s)]
*  UN will have to watch. We also don't know if or when these forces will get to Haiti. They voted [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2277.68s)]
*  to do this and they actually have to do it. So it could take months. But I don't know, Ben, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2282.8799999999997s)]
*  what did you make of this abstention from Russia and China? And what is your level of optimism here [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2286.8799999999997s)]
*  that this Kenyan-led mission could really help change things? Look, I think this has to be [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2293.68s)]
*  welcomed as real progress here. It's a real meaningful step where there's been a total [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2299.2s)]
*  absence of international support for Kenya. And there was an effort, the US is trying to get [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2305.68s)]
*  Canada to send some forces down there, but this ultimately may be better and more appropriate, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2309.68s)]
*  given the terrible history of Western intervention and or neglect of Haiti over the years. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2315.68s)]
*  To have a Kenyan-led force like this makes a lot of sense. To your point, we talked a lot [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2321.9199999999996s)]
*  the last couple of episodes about how dysfunctional the UN's gotten, how diminished UNGA seem to be, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2328.3199999999997s)]
*  the UN General Assembly meetings. This does demonstrate that maybe the only formula that [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2333.76s)]
*  can work, particularly at the Security Council, to build on something you said, Tommy, is that [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2340.2400000000002s)]
*  if Russia and China are really banking on hugging the global south, Russia trying to get support for [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2345.36s)]
*  its policies or at least try to keep the global south neutral on issues related to Ukraine, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2352.8s)]
*  China trying to position itself as its leader, that if important countries in Africa like Kenya [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2358.96s)]
*  and countries in the Caribbean are saying, we need this, we want to do this, we need support, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2367.28s)]
*  that they won't be, they, Russia and China, won't be blocking US foreign policy if they veto this. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2373.68s)]
*  They'd be blocking something that the global south wanted and needed done. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2379.76s)]
*  And so that's an interesting lesson. Another reason I think the US should be putting a lot [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2384.7200000000003s)]
*  more focus on what the interests are of sub-Saharan African countries, for instance, [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2389.76s)]
*  or Caribbean countries. One reason we should be focused more on that is because it's the only way [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2394.32s)]
*  to potentially break some of these great power log jams at places like Security Council. So [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2399.0400000000004s)]
*  that's an interesting lesson to take from this. Now, as you said, this is not a panacea here. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2403.0400000000004s)]
*  And I worry, one of my worries is we are dumping a lot on Kenyan security forces that are not [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2407.7599999999998s)]
*  accustomed to these kinds of deployments. And I think that means that we have to sustain support. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2414.0s)]
*  This is a very good down payment from the United States of 200 million, but I think it can't just [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2419.12s)]
*  be like, now this is done and we kind of pull away from it. I'm not suggesting that's what we're [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2423.44s)]
*  planning to do, but six months from now, one year from now, the US has to continue to be probably [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2428.08s)]
*  not only providing funding, but going around the world and trying to get other countries [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2433.2799999999997s)]
*  to continue to support this mission. The Kenyans are probably going to need a lot of advice [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2436.72s)]
*  and support that the US can help provide and other countries can help provide. And yeah, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2441.6s)]
*  you're going to have to monitor this stuff. By the way, this is not to single out the Kenyans. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2445.6s)]
*  I mean, any previous UN forces from other countries have had problems of corruption. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2448.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah, sexual assault. I mean, horrible thing. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2454.64s)]
*  Sexual assault, exactly. It's such a mess down there that it's hard for anybody to go and not [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2456.08s)]
*  be kind of captured by the corruption and chaos there. And so there does need to be a lot of [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2461.28s)]
*  oversight, but this is one where the UN, if I'm at the UN, I'm really trying to lean in and do [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2466.96s)]
*  everything I can to make this as much of a success as possible. So whatever resources the UN can [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2472.8s)]
*  provide down there in terms of personnel and expertise, this is something to be surging, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2477.2000000000003s)]
*  those resources too, because you want to demonstrate that there's still a space for the UN [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2481.6800000000003s)]
*  to do missions like this and to be relevant. And if you can make things just a bit better down there, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2486.1600000000003s)]
*  that would go a long way to addressing a really catastrophic humanitarian situation. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2491.04s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of work ahead. But in man, these are real serious gangs. They're well armed. They're [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2495.52s)]
*  dug in. This is zero sum for them. This is where they live. So they're not going to want to [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2500.4s)]
*  relinquish control. But boy, really, really hope they can some sort of breakthrough here and [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2504.56s)]
*  protect some people. One other thing I'd say it's interesting is that William Ruto is the [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2509.76s)]
*  president of Kenya, and he's the guy with an interesting past. He once had an ICC indictment [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2513.52s)]
*  on him that ultimately got lifted. Very charismatic politician who was vice president of Kenya for a [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2517.68s)]
*  lot of whiffs of corruption around him over the years. One of the things he's done as president [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2523.3599999999997s)]
*  is he's clearly trying to play a bigger role in the world stage. He just hosted like a major climate [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2528.3199999999997s)]
*  summit, an African climate summit. Yeah. And now he's doing this. And I think that's good. I mean, [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2533.2s)]
*  I'm not suggesting, I think there's still questions around corruption. But it's good [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2538.16s)]
*  that a leader like that, he was outspoken on the coup in Niger against that. It's good that we have [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2543.68s)]
*  countries like Kenya stepping up to play a bigger role. You want these kind of regional powers, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2548.7200000000003s)]
*  like an East African power like Kenya to say, you know what, we want to have a voice on climate. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2553.76s)]
*  We want to have a voice on international security. And I think that is a real positive development. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2557.84s)]
*  Ben Rhodes, once again, leading from behind. Just kidding. That's a deep, deep, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2561.76s)]
*  I was not the background. I know neither was Sean Kelly. Ben, in the last couple of shows, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2566.56s)]
*  we talked about Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleging that agents of the Indian [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2571.68s)]
*  government carried out an assassination on a Sikh leader and Canadian citizen on Canadian soil. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2578.08s)]
*  This is a guy named Hardeeb Singh Najjar, who's murdered in British Columbia in June. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2583.9199999999996s)]
*  India's reaction to these allegations have been the furthest thing from chastened or conciliatory. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2589.04s)]
*  Or I mean, today, for example, the Financial Times reported that India has ordered Canada [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2596.16s)]
*  to withdraw about 40 diplomats from the country. Previously, India announced a visa ban for [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2601.12s)]
*  Canadians. The National Secretary for the Youth Party with the BJP Prime Minister Modi's party [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2607.68s)]
*  tweeted, quote, Najjar was gay and Justin Trudeau used to like him, but Najjar ditched Trudeau for [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2616.4s)]
*  someone else. Is this reason for murder? Along with a photo of Najjar, next to a man with his [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2622.08s)]
*  face blurred out. Obviously, that's ludicrous, but this just folds into a broader point, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2629.36s)]
*  which is these Canadian allegations have not embarrassed the Indian government at all. In [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2635.92s)]
*  fact, Modi's doing what he's always doing, which is fanning the flames of nationalism [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2641.52s)]
*  and using it to incite his supporters and not giving an inch. I think that Trudeau had absolutely [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2645.6s)]
*  no choice but to go public with this kind of information. He's a Canadian citizen killed in [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2652.6400000000003s)]
*  Canadian soil. He lives in a democracy. You can't cover up a crime like this. I'm pretty sure the [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2656.32s)]
*  press would have found out no matter what, but it just does speak to how challenging the politics [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2661.36s)]
*  are. Because again, Canada's throwing weight around, but not as much weight as the Indian [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2666.2400000000002s)]
*  government does at this point. And they're in a tough spot. Yeah, but this is really outrageous [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2673.1200000000003s)]
*  and it's bullshit and it needs to be called out far more than it has been. I mean, and this is [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2678.1600000000003s)]
*  common. And what Modi does is he doesn't come out and say this stuff, but Obama made a veiled [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2682.32s)]
*  reference to the fact that targeting minorities in India could cause cake. He's wrong. And some [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2687.6000000000004s)]
*  minister came out and threatened to kill Obama. It was normal. It's always some guy who's one degree [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2693.44s)]
*  removed from Modi saying really crazy stuff. And now this crude thing about homosexuality, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2699.92s)]
*  that plays into this kind of weird mixture. The Indian BJP playbook is the most absurd [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2705.28s)]
*  manifestation of thin skinned people acting really tough. Trudeau, as you said, had no choice here. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2716.08s)]
*  He can't just say like, oh, okay, they killed the Indian intelligence services, killed in a contract [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2725.68s)]
*  killing somebody in Canada, a Canadian citizen in Canada, but I'm not going to talk about it [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2732.88s)]
*  because we want geopolitical relations with India. The United States needs to get involved here. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2737.92s)]
*  The US government, the British government, the Australian government, New Zealand are all [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2744.0s)]
*  implicated in this because this is five eyes intelligence, intelligence sharing countries. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2748.48s)]
*  But I'd also think Europe should get involved here. And it can be quietly, but the message has [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2752.32s)]
*  to be clear. You guys cannot do this. You cannot step this far out of the boundaries [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2756.48s)]
*  of international norms and expect lots of investment to be flowing in from the West. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2761.9199999999996s)]
*  Part of what India wants is to attract a lot of investment so that they can try to catch up in [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2767.9199999999996s)]
*  their economic growth with China. Well, what kind of message are they sending? They're sending a [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2772.08s)]
*  message that like, we're going to kill diplomats or kill people in other countries. And then [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2776.56s)]
*  if that gets out, we're going to throw out all the diplomats of that country. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2781.44s)]
*  I can't imagine there's going to be much Canadian investment in India. And how can anybody else in [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2784.3999999999996s)]
*  Europe or the United States or anywhere else in the world be assured that that might not happen [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2789.68s)]
*  in their country too? And there's a similar dust up. So there has to be a message that there are [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2793.9199999999996s)]
*  going to be some consequences if this continues, because if you don't send that message, they're [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2798.3999999999996s)]
*  just going to keep doing it. And they're going to take the message that this works. Like if there's [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2802.56s)]
*  not a consequence of this, if the US is not kind of tightening the screws, at least behind the scenes, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2807.3599999999997s)]
*  the message that Modi and the BJP will take is actually look at this, this is great. We can kill [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2811.52s)]
*  people in other countries. And then we can freak out when we get called out on this and intimidate [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2816.4s)]
*  everybody and it works. And so just like Khashoggi, by the way, five year anniversary of that killing, [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2821.28s)]
*  it will happen again and again, if the message is sent that the world's major advanced democracies [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2827.2000000000003s)]
*  think it's too hard to have some uncomfortable conversations with geopolitically important [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2833.44s)]
*  countries. Yeah. And just such nonsense and bravado. I also saw right before we started recording, [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2838.56s)]
*  Indian authorities raided the homes and seized a bunch of phones and laptops from reporters at a [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2844.96s)]
*  site called NewsClick, which is like a left leaning news outlet in India that's been really critical [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2850.08s)]
*  of the Modi government. The Indian government has long accused NewsClick of financial misconduct, [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2854.96s)]
*  but they, I think did this raid under the new national security law. Last August, the New York [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2861.76s)]
*  Times reported that NewsClick was getting money from this rich American tech investor with ties [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2866.0s)]
*  to the Chinese communist party. So there's just a lot of really scary authoritarian things happening [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2871.52s)]
*  in Modi's India that's not getting a lot of attention. Yeah. No, not enough. And I think [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2876.96s)]
*  it's the very influential and very important, very successful Indian diaspora communities around the [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2881.7599999999998s)]
*  world who've generally been very supportive of Modi, they too have a lot of influence here too. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2887.28s)]
*  To say, look, and I'm not telling people that they all have to agree with us politically on even [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2891.68s)]
*  pluralism. And we're just talking about basic stuff, like not killing people in other countries. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2897.68s)]
*  There has to be some line to this. You can be a BJP supporter all you want, but this is way outside [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2903.12s)]
*  the boundaries. This is not good for India. I really truly believe it's not good for India [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2910.16s)]
*  in the long run. And again, it's like a manufactured threat. There's no risk of a sick separatist [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2914.0s)]
*  movement creating a sick state like seceding from India. It's nonsense. It's just like they [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2919.12s)]
*  manufactured this entire problem by going after this guy for absolutely no reason. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2925.68s)]
*  Yeah. They're probably fueling that kind of separatism around the world by doing this. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2929.44s)]
*  Yeah. All right. Final story, Ben. So sad news for zoo lovers. Starting next year, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2933.7599999999998s)]
*  no American zoos will have a panda exhibit because for the first time we'll be panda free in 50 [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2938.96s)]
*  years because the pandas, they had been on loan from the Chinese government. And in the sign of [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2945.12s)]
*  the times, the Chinese government is refusing to extend the contracts on those loans. So the pandas [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2950.0s)]
*  will be going home. The first diplomatic pandas arrived in the US during the Nixon administration. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2956.4s)]
*  It was called Panda Diplomacy. They sent a couple pandas to Washington, DC to the zoo there. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2962.64s)]
*  But I don't know. I'm half sad and I also half think that zoos are an abomination. And every time [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2968.56s)]
*  I go to one, I leave feeling really depressed for all the animals involved. So I don't know [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2975.84s)]
*  how to feel about this, but I don't know if you have a take about the geopolitics because [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2979.28s)]
*  that's why people are listening to this thing anyway. I mean, I used to go to the Washington [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2982.5600000000004s)]
*  Zoo a lot with my kids. I'll give this take to me and I'll just give you a tip [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2985.76s)]
*  as a father of a young daughter now. If you are going to miss the pandas, [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=2997.36s)]
*  there's a show on Apple TV plus called Stillwater about a giant panda that lives next door to these [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3002.3999999999996s)]
*  kids. And this panda drops some fucking wisdom. Basically what happens is these kids, they have [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3010.16s)]
*  problems and something makes them sad and they go over to this panda and this panda is like, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3017.52s)]
*  let me tell you a story. And this panda just like, he breaks it down with this kind of Zen, [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3023.9199999999996s)]
*  like Buddhist kind of wisdom. He's often meditating. I think we can get what we were [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3029.6s)]
*  getting from the panda diplomacy and from the pandas in these zoos from this cartoon that is [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3035.44s)]
*  on Apple TV plus. I think we've got it covered. I think we're fine. I think people, if you liked [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3041.12s)]
*  Bluey and I was dropping Bluey Rex early on in that process, I think Stillwater is, it's literally [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3045.76s)]
*  in that weight class. Not as funny, but like, and for the parents involved out there, like [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3052.4s)]
*  an edible too, like you really can get on the wavelength with this panda. Okay. So that's what [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3058.48s)]
*  I'd say as a solution here. I will say like the world feels, it's one of those weeks, Tommy, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3065.6s)]
*  where the world feels like not great to me. It's like, we got speaker of the house being ousted [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3071.6800000000003s)]
*  in this country. We like that part. Well, we like that part, but the point is like we got [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3077.6s)]
*  Ukraine stalemate, Russians testing nuclear missiles. We've got the Chinese pulling the [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3082.8s)]
*  pandas out. We've got the Indians whacking people in other countries. It's one of these weeks where [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3088.56s)]
*  I'm kind of looking around and like, are we kind of halfway through the collapse here? And like, [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3093.2000000000003s)]
*  where's the bottom of this thing? And so I don't know. I don't know if the pandas are part of that, [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3096.96s)]
*  but it seems like, can we just have nice things in this world? It does seem like there's not a lot [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3103.04s)]
*  of cost to just extending the panda contract. This is one of these things that Chinese government does. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3108.0s)]
*  So punitive. What's the point? I guess, you know, in terms of TV with Lizette, I mean, she's [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3112.0s)]
*  10 months and a couple of days. I was hanging out with her on the couch. The Patriots game was on [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3118.4s)]
*  TV. She was not paying any attention. Now that's understandable because Mack Jones was throwing [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3124.8s)]
*  picks left and right and we were just not looking good. But then I don't know if you ever watched [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3129.52s)]
*  Miss Rachel speak of like sort of North Korean style, cult of personality. You put a little kid [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3133.12s)]
*  in front of Miss Rachel and they will march. They will do anything she says. So that's where [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3140.88s)]
*  we're at in terms of the very, very, very, very limited screen time that Lizette gets, which like [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3145.84s)]
*  once a month, if that. I remember being struck like, you know, I think after, I forgot how old [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3151.28s)]
*  our kids were. They were over one probably, but like, once you like Sesame Street comes on, [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3157.36s)]
*  it's really interesting. Like, yeah, you could have like, you know, the Jets game on and they're [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3163.12s)]
*  not paying attention, which, you know, is smart of them. But if Sesame Street comes on, like even [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3166.72s)]
*  a baby will like turn their head. Like there's something about like those voices and those [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3172.0s)]
*  colors. The way they do it. Yeah. I miss Sesame Street too. It's like kind of sad. You'll get to [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3175.6s)]
*  that point where the kids start to outgrow things. And so like, I remember they get to be like, [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3180.3199999999997s)]
*  I think it's around four or five. They kind of lose interest in Sesame Street. And I'm kind of like, [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3184.64s)]
*  can we watch Sesame Street? And they're like, dad, that's lame. I'm like, no, it's kind of nice. It [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3188.72s)]
*  makes me feel good. You know? Yeah. So I don't know. I watch Sesame Street by myself sometimes. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3194.08s)]
*  We will all miss Ling Ling and Sing Sing. They might be dead by now. I think those are the [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3199.2s)]
*  Nixon ones. But with that, we're going to take a quick break. And when we come back, you will hear [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3204.08s)]

*  before we came on. You worked in the CIA for several years. I was on the National Security [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3423.2799999999997s)]
*  Council. Almost every debate that I was in about North Korea or every situation or meeting focused [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3428.0s)]
*  on their nuclear weapons program. This documentary does something different. It's focused on the [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3434.48s)]
*  North Korean people, the unbelievable hardships they face, the risks they take trying to escape [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3440.16s)]
*  the country. I have read that conditions in North Korea got much, much worse after the COVID-19 [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3445.8399999999997s)]
*  pandemic because the border was closed and a lot of the sort of cross-border commerce that happened [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3453.3599999999997s)]
*  under the table was cut off essentially. Can you give us a sense of what life is like for the [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3458.08s)]
*  average person in North Korea today? Well, misery, right? If you're talking about average North [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3463.3599999999997s)]
*  Korean, not elites. Elites are okay, right? Elites still live pretty fine. Kim Jong-un is [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3469.36s)]
*  one of the wealthiest person in the planet. It was always bad. There were some famine years in the [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3474.8s)]
*  1990s, if you remember, where millions of people perished and people have constant food shortages, [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3482.32s)]
*  malnourishment, obviously no information, security services, the field tactics. It's a totalitarian [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3488.4s)]
*  state. But as you mentioned, North Korea was the first country to close the border when COVID [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3495.12s)]
*  happened in January 2020. So what happened was actually that border closure more to North Korea's [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3501.68s)]
*  economy than sanctions ever could. So there's no trade going back and forth. So right now internally, [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3508.88s)]
*  there are food shortages, there's malnutrition, the economic state is quite bad. Now we know the [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3517.12s)]
*  nuclear missile programs are advancing just fine. But you ask about average North Korean and for [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3522.96s)]
*  life of average North Korean situation is very dire. Yeah, it really looks horrific. I mean, [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3528.48s)]
*  so the documentary Beyond Utopia, it follows this South Korean pastor named Pastor Kim. He estimates [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3533.52s)]
*  that he has helped rescue over 1000 people who have escaped North Korea. What listeners might not [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3540.32s)]
*  understand about that process is that it's basically impossible. You can't go from North [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3546.7200000000003s)]
*  Korea to South Korea because you have to literally walk through a minefield. So you end up going [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3551.76s)]
*  across North Korea's border with China, you have to cross a river that in itself is incredibly [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3555.44s)]
*  harrowing. But the journey doesn't stop there. You have to traverse China, you have to get through [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3560.48s)]
*  Vietnam, and then Laos before finally reaching Thailand, where defectors can turn themselves [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3566.6400000000003s)]
*  into the authorities get some help and not risk being sent back to their certain death, essentially. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3572.0s)]
*  Can you tell us about that journey and the obstacles that the people face? [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3576.2400000000002s)]
*  It's very harrowing. You're risking your life. First, you have to leave North Korea. And the [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3580.4s)]
*  only way to leave is that porous border between North Korea and China. Because again, the two [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3586.1600000000003s)]
*  Koreas are divided by the DMZ. There are soldiers, there's mines, it's impossible to [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3591.52s)]
*  flee that way. Although some people have tried on fishing boat and whatnot. But vast majority of [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3596.08s)]
*  North Koreans have to flee crossing that border. And usually during wintertime, there's a frozen [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3601.84s)]
*  river, you have to make it out with our North Korean border guards catching you and sending [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3607.2s)]
*  you back. If you get caught, obviously you'll be sent to prison. Once you make it to China, [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3613.2799999999997s)]
*  then you have to be worried about getting caught by the Chinese services. Because China, [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3619.12s)]
*  the Chinese government, the policy is to send back the North Korean defectors. They don't even [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3624.0s)]
*  call them defectors. They call them economic migrants, and they send them back to North Korea. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3629.2799999999997s)]
*  So you have to evade these people, the security services, get hooked up with people who can help [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3634.4s)]
*  you, brokers, people like Pastor Kim, some sort of NGO networks. And then the journey really begins [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3640.56s)]
*  through the mountains, the valleys, the rivers, and trying not to get caught. It's a very harrowing [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3647.92s)]
*  journey. And we didn't know as filmmakers, by the way, when we were shooting this, we would have a [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3653.28s)]
*  film at the end, because this is all about as this defection was happening, we filmed their lives, [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3660.08s)]
*  but we didn't know if they were going to get caught and sent back. So you use the word harrowing, [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3666.48s)]
*  so I keep using it. But yeah, it's perilous journey. Incredible filmmaking, but you know, [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3671.84s)]
*  devastating to watch. I won't ruin it for folks who want to watch it. But you track a couple [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3676.7999999999997s)]
*  different journeys, some more successful than others. And you know, every step along the way, [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3680.72s)]
*  these people are putting so much trust into, you know, fixers, minders, whatever you want to call [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3687.6s)]
*  them. In the US, we probably call them smugglers, helping people get across. At times, it seems like [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3693.2799999999997s)]
*  some of these desperate people trying to rescue a son or a daughter or a grandmother are just [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3701.2s)]
*  getting the run around and extorted for more cash. And, you know, it's really it's unbelievable that [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3705.7599999999998s)]
*  they go through this. There are people who are genuinely trying to help North Koreans flee, [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3711.6s)]
*  leave North Korea, because it's out of, you know, just it's to help them in genuine way. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3717.2s)]
*  And then there are brokers who are, you know, for them, it's a business, and it's a way to make money. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3724.0s)]
*  So even after you help them, once North Korean defectors arrive in South Korea and go through [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3729.44s)]
*  the whole Hanawon and training and three months in this kind of facility and come back out, [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3734.16s)]
*  they actually have to pay back the brokers. So for some people, it's a business deal to get [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3739.44s)]
*  these North Korean defectors out. You know, we talked about this journey. I mean, I didn't only [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3746.64s)]
*  fear for the defector safety. I thought about Pastor Kim's safety, this heroic man who's helping [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3750.56s)]
*  so many people. You know, we know that North Korea has assassinated, quote unquote, enemies abroad. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3755.36s)]
*  We know that the Chinese government probably doesn't love someone running a smuggling operation [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3761.6s)]
*  in their territory and potentially making them look foolish in this film. I mean, [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3766.72s)]
*  how risky do you think Pastor Kim's work is knowing that he's not just sitting in an office [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3770.48s)]
*  in South Korea, he's like getting out into the world and physically helping people? [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3775.2s)]
*  Very risky. In fact, South Korean intelligence service told Pastor Kim that his life is in [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3778.48s)]
*  danger because they got information that, you know, his life is in danger. His mother got imprisoned [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3783.7599999999998s)]
*  in China at one point. Pastor Kim himself spent some time in Chinese prison cell. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3790.56s)]
*  You know, he's risking his life. He himself cannot now go back to China. The situation is that bad. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3796.96s)]
*  He can only help people once they make it out of China. But there's no question about it. He's [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3804.16s)]
*  risking his life and his family's lives. But he believes this is God's calling and he believes [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3809.68s)]
*  this is his mission in life. Yeah, he seems like a truly incredible person. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3815.52s)]
*  One of the families you guys feature in the documentary is multi-generational. There's [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3819.84s)]
*  a, you know, 80 year old grandmother down to like, I don't know, three, four, five year old little [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3823.44s)]
*  girls. There's this remarkable scene, I believe once they're safe, where you're interviewing the [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3827.04s)]
*  grandmother and then separately the little girls about North Korea and asking them about Kim Jong-un [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3834.56s)]
*  and they're still speaking about him in this sort of reverent way. And I was wondering if you could [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3840.4s)]
*  help unpack why you think that is. Is this fear? Is this the only narrative they've ever known? [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3844.8799999999997s)]
*  How long does it normally take folks who get out of North Korea to, I don't know, shake that [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3850.08s)]
*  narrative off if they do at all? Well, you're actually describing a scene that was very [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3854.24s)]
*  revealing. It's one of my, I don't know if I should call it favorite, but it was a very revealing scene [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3858.64s)]
*  about ideological indoctrination that goes on in North Korea. Because we were able to shoot [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3865.12s)]
*  these people as it was happening versus, you know, they make it to South Korea and they spend [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3872.24s)]
*  some time in South Korea and they're able to process. They were still in this mindset, right? [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3876.7999999999997s)]
*  Grandmother didn't really know what she was seeing and what she's experiencing. All she knows is just [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3883.04s)]
*  her entire life, this indoctrination of the Kim regime with just treating them as if they're, [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3888.3999999999996s)]
*  right, Kim Il-sung is God and Kim Jong-il was son of God and so is Kim Jong-un. And this is kind of [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3895.52s)]
*  like religion for them. So when you ask her this question of what do you think about Kim Jong-un, [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3900.56s)]
*  she gives a very honest and candid answer that could not be scripted, that could not possibly. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3906.08s)]
*  So that was very revealing. I don't want to spoil it for the people who's watching, [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3912.16s)]
*  but her answer was so authentic and real and that really speaks to what happens, the brainwashing [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3916.0s)]
*  that goes in North Korea. When I say it's the most heavily indoctrinated society on the planet, it is [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3923.2s)]
*  because there's no other regime and no other country that this level of ideological indoctrination [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3929.76s)]
*  goes on than place like North Korea. And this is how the regime survives, right? [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3937.0400000000004s)]
*  With ideological indoctrination, the field tactic, the security service and all of that. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3941.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think it's probably very hard for people who live in the West, who live in a free [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3945.6800000000003s)]
*  society where you can Google anything you want to understand the real power of propaganda. If it's [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3949.28s)]
*  literally the only thing you've ever heard in your life, but you can see Kim Jong-un's policies [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3955.36s)]
*  killing the people around you and still believe this narrative that as you mentioned is essentially [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3961.28s)]
*  stolen from the Bible and ascribed to the sort of Kim dynasty and it's led to this sort of cult of [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3966.1600000000003s)]
*  personality in this regime that's still going. It's really interesting. Kim Il-sung's mother [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3972.7200000000003s)]
*  was actually a Christian. And so there's a lot of Korea watchers actually think that Kim Il-sung [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3977.44s)]
*  consciously modeled the state after Christianity, like literally putting himself in as like a God [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3982.7999999999997s)]
*  like figure. There's something called like a Bible that's like for Kim Il-sung, right? There's like [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3989.8399999999997s)]
*  a hymnal North Korean version that's singing praises about the Kim family. There's like [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=3994.9599999999996s)]
*  Bible study groups that are all about Kim Il-sung studying of Kim Il-sung thought, right? And the [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4000.7999999999997s)]
*  sort of, you know, so it's really very interesting, but it's a cult like state, no question about it. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4006.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's an amazing scene. I mentioned at the top, a US army private named Travis King [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4012.32s)]
*  crossed into North Korea back in July. When that happened, I assumed he would be there for years, [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4018.0s)]
*  if not decades, if not, you know, forever. He was released recently. Do you have any sense or a [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4024.0s)]
*  theory about how Travis King was sent home relatively quickly? And if this is a signal [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4031.04s)]
*  of anything broader, any broader detente? I don't think it's a signal of broader detente. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4036.4s)]
*  I really think the Kim regime is done talking to the US government. It's almost a signal that they [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4041.2s)]
*  don't need to use Travis King as some sort of a hook. Because remember, in the past, to get any [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4046.08s)]
*  American citizen out of North Korea, we had to send a high level US official, Bill Clinton went and [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4052.8799999999997s)]
*  and so on. Yeah, Bill Richardson went. And so I think it's almost a signal that they don't, [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4060.16s)]
*  they're not interested in talking to us. So first of all, I don't think they value Travis King as [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4066.48s)]
*  you know, in terms of propaganda value or Intel value, they didn't see it. And then secondly, [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4071.7599999999998s)]
*  they're not interested in talking to US government or even using him as a bargain. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4078.08s)]
*  And I think coming out of Putin Kim Jong-un meeting and this whole conversation about potential arms [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4082.3199999999997s)]
*  deal that they could be having on the side, North Korea closing up to Putin. And so, and at the same [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4088.7999999999997s)]
*  time, absolutely unwilling to talk to the Biden administration to sit down with Americans to talk [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4097.28s)]
*  about the nuclear jation to talk about the nuclear program. It's almost a signal that they're not [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4103.12s)]
*  interested in coming back to talks. Not anytime soon. That's troubling. Do you think that this, [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4107.36s)]
*  in these recent conversations with Putin and the fact that the Russians finally need North Korea, [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4112.639999999999s)]
*  in this case for artillery shells, has sort of changed the calculus and their political standing? [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4117.12s)]
*  A little bit. I mean, first of all, what a role reversal, right? Russia is supposed to be a patron [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4121.04s)]
*  sponsor of North Korea. So this really speaks to how pathetic Putin, Russia is like, you have to [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4125.84s)]
*  go to the hundred and ninety eighth ranked economy in the world for artillery shells and ammunition. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4133.04s)]
*  But the point is these two very isolated leaders need each other and they have things to give each [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4138.72s)]
*  other. Right. North Korea has a lot of ammunition, artillery shells. They are primitive. They're [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4145.52s)]
*  traditional. They're not small shells with these GPS things and not advanced ammunition. But still, [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4150.32s)]
*  North Korea is sitting on a lot of them. And this is about world of supply lines. So it's [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4157.599999999999s)]
*  helpful to the Russians. And North Koreans need technology from Russia. They had two failed [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4163.2s)]
*  satellite launches, military satellite launches. So they're looking for technology to improve on [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4169.84s)]
*  that. They rolled out diesel powered submarine, but now they're looking for nuclear power submarine. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4174.48s)]
*  Russia's technology will help on that front. It will help on intercontinental ballistic missiles. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4181.5199999999995s)]
*  So I think they can help each other. And so this is a disconcerting development for Putin and [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4186.4s)]
*  Kim Jong-un to get together even close and then get more close. And so I don't like it, obviously. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4193.919999999999s)]
*  I've been looking at this scene. We should be very concerned. No, it's very worrisome, especially [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4201.76s)]
*  if the ICBM technology plus nuclear warhead miniaturization plus the reentry vehicle [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4205.4400000000005s)]
*  to safely get that nuclear warhead back into the atmosphere after it achieves orbit. It's a very [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4213.280000000001s)]
*  scary combination that could lead to a real security risk. And this is everything that North [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4218.56s)]
*  Korea has been doing. The missile test, they are just continually developing, advancing, modernizing, [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4222.4800000000005s)]
*  perfecting their nuclear missile arsenal. So this is only going to expedite their nuclear missile [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4228.0s)]
*  program. And you make an interesting point about this role reversal here. I mean, you guys talked [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4234.88s)]
*  about this in the film, but historically, the Soviet Union was the benefactor of North Korea, [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4239.44s)]
*  provided them with a lot of assistance, kept the economy afloat for many years, and then the [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4245.04s)]
*  collapse happened and North Korea was thrown into the wolves, unfortunately, horrifyingly for the [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4249.28s)]
*  people. So listen, you and I both worked in government. We both saw a lot of sanctions [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4254.8s)]
*  go into place. Sanctions have not slowed or stopped, or maybe they've slowed. They certainly [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4260.0s)]
*  haven't stopped North Korea's nuclear program. You were just talking about how this new partnership [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4265.360000000001s)]
*  with Russia could speed things up. They clearly have damaged sanctions, that is the North Korean [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4269.360000000001s)]
*  economy. I wonder if at some point, and I've asked US officials this in the Biden administration, [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4275.92s)]
*  whether the international community has to just say, listen, this guy's never going to give up [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4281.76s)]
*  his nukes. Sanctions are primarily seeming to hurt the North Korean people. Should we rethink [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4285.68s)]
*  our approach? Is there some way to pull back maybe the most broad-based sanctions, focus on [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4294.0s)]
*  human rights-based sanctions, or just sanctioning specific individuals to see if that might—look, [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4299.12s)]
*  I don't think it's going to slow down Kim Jong-un, but maybe improve the lives of the North Korean [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4304.400000000001s)]
*  people? Is that a naive thought? I mean, what's your take on sort of the approach here? [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4308.4s)]
*  Well, first of all, sanctions are only effective when they're implemented, and Russia and China [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4313.599999999999s)]
*  have not been implementing sanctions. We saw a brief window in the fall of 2017 when they were [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4319.92s)]
*  actually doing something about it, but today it's not 2017, right? And they have not been [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4324.48s)]
*  implementing sanctions. I, in fact, even say that in some ways, North Korea, for North Korea, [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4329.759999999999s)]
*  external environment is actually favorable because there is complete impasse at United [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4335.68s)]
*  States, China, and Russia are not on board on implementing sanctions. So sanctions are not [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4341.68s)]
*  going to get anywhere. I think we're not going to get North Korea to denuclearize. That idea that [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4345.52s)]
*  North Korea could potentially give up nuclear weapons, there's a 0% chance. I would argue there's [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4352.64s)]
*  0% chance. It is already nuclear weapons power. It has 60 nuclear warheads. It's making enough [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4359.12s)]
*  missile material to turn out a dozen new bombs per year. It's just not. So then we need a new [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4364.56s)]
*  approach, but that's not necessarily just unilaterally easing up on sanctions. I think [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4370.8s)]
*  that's not going to really get anywhere either. So I really think we need a long-term approach, [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4377.52s)]
*  and it's really one that's focused on North Korean people, but it's more long-term. It's [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4382.400000000001s)]
*  about getting information into North Korea. It's about trying to maybe work with technology [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4386.56s)]
*  companies to try to find a way to bring some internet access to North Korea. It's really a [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4392.48s)]
*  long-term picture because I think the only change that can come about in North Korea is through [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4397.599999999999s)]
*  North Korean people. Trying to work with the regime, this is not going to get anywhere. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4404.32s)]
*  And I would argue when you said sanctions are only hurting North Korean people, it's the North [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4411.2s)]
*  Korean regime that's hurting North Korean people. During the famine years when millions of people [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4416.08s)]
*  died, Kim Jong-il spent $800 million building a mausoleum for Kim Il-sung. This is 1994 when [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4420.56s)]
*  Kim Il-sung died. So they are the ones who are misspending money. They are the ones spending [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4428.8s)]
*  billions of dollars in armaments and developing nuclear missile programs instead of feeding their [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4433.360000000001s)]
*  people. So I'll push back a little bit on the idea that we are somehow hurting North Korean people. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4438.72s)]
*  It's the regime that's hurting North Korean people. Yeah, no, I totally agree with that. I think, [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4443.52s)]
*  obviously, a series of North Korean leaders have entirely focused on military spending and [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4447.52s)]
*  development at the great expense of their people. And anyone who gets out of line gets shot with [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4452.8s)]
*  anti-aircraft guns or other horrific torture devices or sent to gulags, et cetera. I just think [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4457.280000000001s)]
*  that American politics are stupid. And sometimes we continue with an approach for 20 years like we [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4463.200000000001s)]
*  did in Afghanistan. And the outcome, I think a lot of people could have told you 15 years ago, 10 [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4470.96s)]
*  years ago would probably be where it is today. And I just worry that the politics of being seen [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4476.32s)]
*  as lenient on quote unquote bad regimes, which in this case, North Korea very much is like North [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4481.92s)]
*  Korea or Iran or Venezuela or sort of like pick your party and just sanctioning them to death with [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4487.04s)]
*  no real clear end goal or hope of changing the regime's behavior, evidence that the behavior [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4493.599999999999s)]
*  would change seems also kind of foolish. But, you know, I don't have a better idea. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4500.639999999999s)]
*  No. So, I mean, that's I agree with you on finding ways to help North Korean people. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4505.28s)]
*  And here, that's why I keep focusing back on let's try to get information into North Korea, [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4511.36s)]
*  at least let's raise awareness, you know, with North Korean people so they know [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4516.16s)]
*  a little bit about outside world. Yeah. And I also think, you know, we're talking about defector [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4521.5199999999995s)]
*  stories. I that information penetration campaign should be also targeted to the elites as well. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4525.679999999999s)]
*  So the elites know there could be outside life outside of North Korea. The reason why the regime, [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4531.76s)]
*  the Kim regime can continue is because the elites continue to support the regime, right? Their fate [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4537.92s)]
*  is tied to the regime's fate. So we got to also get somehow the elites to be aware or to be able [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4542.96s)]
*  to sort of separate their fate from the regimes. But it's a it's, you know, I always say it's one [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4551.52s)]
*  of the toughest challenge for U.S. policy. Right. I'm sure everybody's like, oh, they're whatever [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4558.4800000000005s)]
*  country you're studying following Iran, Russia. I really think North Korea is one of the most [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4564.320000000001s)]
*  difficult challenge. I mean, this crisis, even the nuclear crisis began in the Clinton administration. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4570.4800000000005s)]
*  Right. Look how many different presidents we went through from Clinton to Bush to Obama to Trump to [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4576.72s)]
*  now Biden administration. It's it's it's a really hard case. Incredibly, incredibly. Well, listen, [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4582.4s)]
*  the documentary is called Beyond Utopia. It is an extraordinary look at what life is like [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4588.799999999999s)]
*  in North Korea and what it's like to defect and the incredible hardships and heroic efforts it [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4593.92s)]
*  takes to get people out. So thank you so much for doing the show. Thanks again to Sumitari for doing [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4598.799999999999s)]
*  the show. You know, happy trails to Kevin McCarthy. He might have more time to listen to podcasts. So [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4602.879999999999s)]
*  if you see Kevin, maybe tell him to subscribe to Pod Save the World. He seems like [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4608.32s)]
*  he could study up on a lot of things, frankly. Yeah. The McCarthy era such as the [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4613.28s)]
*  McCarthy comes to an end. Yeah. Less than the pandas. Yeah. Yeah. The other McCarthy. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4620.0s)]
*  Thanks as pandas for bringing a lot of joy. I guess they'll, you know, they'll be eating bamboo [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4626.08s)]
*  and sleeping a lot in China now instead of Washington. We'll miss you guys. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4632.4s)]
*  Um, well, that's it and we'll talk to you guys next week. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF38xZJQt-w&t=4636.16s)]
