Video Description: Tommy Vietor and Ben Rhodes talk about the drone strike by an Iranian-backed group on a US base in Jordan that killed three US service members, the pressure on Biden to retaliate against Iran directly, and the muddled politics of war. They also cover allegations that UN employees in Gaza participated in the October 7th Hamas attack, the International Court of Justice’s ruling about genocide charges against Israel, and Nancy Pelosi’s odd criticism of activists calling for a ceasefire. They also discuss NATO member fears about Russia, Trump floating major tariffs on China, a Kenyan court blocking the deployment of police to Haiti, and French farmers laying siege to Paris. Then, Tommy speaks with Ali Vaez, Iran Project Director at the International Crisis Group, about Iranian proxy groups, why Iran funds them, and the US conventional wisdom that Iran can only be deterred through military action.

Listen to Dissident At The Doorstep that Tommy and Ben mentioned right here on the Pod Save the World Channel!

# Biden Weighs High-Stakes Response to Iran After Deadly Attack in Jordan | Pod Save the World
**Pod Save the World:** [January 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso)
*  Welcome to Pod Save the World, I'm Tommy Vitor. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Ben Rhodes. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1.72s)]
*  Ben, is Obama still writing the NFL script [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2.88s)]
*  before the season starts or did he kick that to Michelle [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=6.04s)]
*  because she was a better seller? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=8.28s)]
*  Whoever wrote this Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce storyline, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=10.24s)]
*  who wrote this to them? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=14.36s)]
*  Yeah, well, like it's, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  and the storyline of the backlash [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=17.2s)]
*  is also a good part of the twist. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=19.72s)]
*  You seen the conspiracy theories about this? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=21.44s)]
*  Oh, I was, I have to say I had one of those nights [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=23.16s)]
*  where I was awake from like 3.30 to 5.30 last night. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  Love those nights. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=28.6s)]
*  I was actually just telling Fabri, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=30.44s)]
*  like I started with my predictable like 30 minutes on Gaza [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=31.520000000000003s)]
*  and I was like, I gotta stop doing this. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=34.84s)]
*  So then I basically spent an hour plumbing the depths [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=36.92s)]
*  of the Travis Kelce, Taylor Swift conspiracy theory [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=40.84s)]
*  and trying to figure out like what it is. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=46.88s)]
*  And I still don't quite understand it. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=47.72s)]
*  There's a whole narrative that the NFL is rigged [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=50.24s)]
*  to begin with and that the NFL wants the Chiefs [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=52.040000000000006s)]
*  in the Super Bowl because there'll be more eyeballs. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=55.2s)]
*  I can understand that. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=57.08s)]
*  I'm sure the NFL is very happy about this outcome. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=57.92s)]
*  The idea that they script the games ahead of the season [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=60.760000000000005s)]
*  is kind of hilarious to me. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=63.6s)]
*  Well, and also like the Chiefs are in the Super Bowl [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=64.88s)]
*  like almost every year. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=67.44s)]
*  They're really good at football. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=68.76s)]
*  Irrespective of Taylor Swift. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=69.76s)]
*  And again, as coming from like a massive, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=72.52s)]
*  monstrous in a good sense, Swiftie household, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=75.48s)]
*  I've been very attuned to this, right? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=80.68s)]
*  Cause I do, my daughters will now like pay attention [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=82.6s)]
*  to football. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=84.72s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=85.56s)]
*  And that's great. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=86.4s)]
*  And the thing is, is like, you know, part of you wants [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=88.44s)]
*  to be like, oh, at some point I'm gonna get tired of this. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=90.0s)]
*  But then it's like so lovely and charming, you know, like. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=91.44s)]

*  Travis Kelsey is gonna pull down 11 catches [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=94.84s)]
*  in the AFC championship and make out with Taylor [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=97.4s)]
*  on the field after. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=101.0s)]
*  It felt like the most like, you know, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=101.92s)]
*  it felt like the end of like a heartwarming sports movie. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=103.84s)]
*  It sounds like a Taylor Swift song. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=105.84s)]
*  And if there's one thing Americans like, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=106.88s)]
*  it's like a good heartwarming sports movie. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=108.6s)]
*  Probably not the best thing to attack. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=111.0s)]
*  God damn right. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=112.28s)]

*  Cause they're the last team I liked [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=127.36s)]

*  And I literally was like, you know what, guys? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=295.35999999999996s)]
*  You guys got this? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=299.76s)]
*  I'm out of this one. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=300.59999999999997s)]
*  I was like, Tommy can handle the press on this one. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=301.44s)]
*  Like I'm just, I'm out of this. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=304.03999999999996s)]
*  There was a police chase with an embassy car in Beijing. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=306.15999999999997s)]
*  It was a crazy story. It's all in this series. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=310.88s)]
*  Yeah, my personal memory of that story is, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=313.12s)]
*  I remember I was dating someone long distance. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=315.28000000000003s)]
*  I was going to visit her that weekend. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=317.36s)]
*  When I was at the airport about to take off, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=319.0s)]
*  everything was resolved. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=320.72s)]
*  When I landed from my layover, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=322.04s)]
*  everything had blown out of my slick. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=323.6s)]
*  I hate this job. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=325.8s)]
*  But anyway, I check out Dissident at the doorstep. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=326.68s)]
*  It's literally sitting in the Pod Save the World feed. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=328.52s)]
*  And if you don't listen to it, Ben and I will know, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=330.88s)]
*  and we will judge you. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=333.96000000000004s)]
*  Harshly. That's all I got to say. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=335.92s)]
*  Okay, so over the weekend, there was this- [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=337.8s)]
*  The dark turn there. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=340.28000000000003s)]
*  Dark turn. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=341.12s)]
*  Yeah, it was always really hard to make turns on this show. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=341.96000000000004s)]
*  It's like the Today show. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=343.76s)]
*  So over the weekend, there was this horrible drone attack [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=344.88s)]
*  on the US base in Jordan. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=348.03999999999996s)]
*  Killed three US service members and wounded dozens more. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=349.67999999999995s)]
*  The US believes the drone was launched from Iraq [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=352.67999999999995s)]
*  by a Shia militia group linked to Iran. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=355.08s)]
*  US officials told the Wall Street Journal [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=357.67999999999995s)]
*  that the US has no evidence that Iran directed the attack, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=359.71999999999997s)]
*  but they know that Iran provides weapons training [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=362.44s)]
*  and funding to these groups, so they blame Iran. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=364.67999999999995s)]
*  Iran denies they had a role in the incident, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=367.15999999999997s)]
*  but a Telegram channel linked with Iranian-backed [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=368.84s)]
*  militia groups say the attack was retaliation [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=371.47999999999996s)]
*  for a recent US strike in Baghdad against [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=373.96s)]
*  an Iranian-backed militia group called KH. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=376.79999999999995s)]
*  This is very confusing, but it's all- [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=379.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=381.03999999999996s)]
*  I remember KH threats against the US embassy [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=381.88s)]
*  when we were in Baghdad. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=383.88s)]
*  In our day, yeah. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=384.71999999999997s)]
*  So this drone was apparently able to evade [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=385.56s)]
*  air defenses at this base by approaching right [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=387.91999999999996s)]
*  as a US drone was preparing to land, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=390.4s)]
*  which confused the air defense systems. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=392.2s)]
*  It hit a barracks where US service members [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=394.4s)]
*  were all sleeping and had devastating consequences. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=396.4s)]
*  There have been at least 165 attacks [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=399.71999999999997s)]
*  against US service members in Iraq and Syria [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=402.20000000000005s)]
*  since mid-October. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=404.6s)]
*  80 service members had been injured [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=406.0s)]
*  before this incident over the weekend. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=407.88000000000005s)]
*  So the question now is, how does the US respond? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=410.04s)]
*  President Biden said, we shall respond, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=413.64000000000004s)]
*  so it's clear they're gonna do something. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=415.48s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal says the response options [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=417.0s)]
*  could include sanctions, attacking Iran's personnel [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=419.68s)]
*  in Syria, Iraq, or Yemen, attacking Iranian ships [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=422.92s)]
*  in the Red Sea, a massive response against [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=426.24s)]
*  just these Iranian-backed militia groups [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=429.64000000000004s)]
*  wherever they're operating, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=431.88s)]
*  or some combination of those options. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=433.28s)]
*  The Journal says a response strike within Iran itself [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=436.12s)]
*  is less likely, which is a relief to read, but we'll see. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=439.24s)]
*  President Biden is under immense pressure [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=443.12s)]
*  from Congress to respond. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=445.04s)]
*  We'll get to that in a minute. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=446.32s)]
*  But Ben, let's try to take listeners [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=447.64s)]
*  inside the situation, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=449.76s)]
*  where we're meeting some debates about what to do here. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=450.64s)]
*  What do you think that conversation is like, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=453.36s)]
*  and did those options outlined by the Wall Street Journal [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=455.36s)]
*  sound like what you'd expect would be presented [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=458.6s)]
*  to the president in this situation, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=462.32000000000005s)]
*  and do you have a guess for what kind of approach he'll take? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=463.24s)]
*  Yeah, and look, first of all, it's obviously tragic [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=465.92s)]
*  when you lose service members like that, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=469.6s)]
*  but these are all reservists, too, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=471.96000000000004s)]
*  and you just feel so bad for people. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=475.64000000000004s)]
*  They're just plucked out of their lives [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=477.12s)]
*  doing their reserve duty in Jordan, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=479.0s)]
*  and caught up in a war that they didn't think [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=481.08000000000004s)]
*  was probably happening when they got called. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=485.28000000000003s)]
*  It's a horrible situation. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=487.64000000000004s)]
*  I've been in meetings about this particular issue. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=490.28s)]
*  It was never as widespread a kind of regional war [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=495.28s)]
*  as it is now, but we dealt, for instance, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=498.4s)]
*  with circumstances where Iranian-backed militias [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=502.03999999999996s)]
*  in Baghdad attacked US troops, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=505.44s)]
*  in some cases killed US troops [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=508.28s)]
*  before the pullout from Iraq in 2011. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=509.56s)]
*  Obviously, throughout the counter-ISIS campaign, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=512.48s)]
*  even though Iran was against ISIS, too, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=516.36s)]
*  US troops were in the vicinity of Iranian-backed groups [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=519.48s)]
*  that sometimes you'd have clashes with. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=522.6s)]
*  And basically, what happens is the Pentagon [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=525.36s)]
*  usually has a list of potential targets. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=528.84s)]
*  Here are the different types of responses, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=535.5600000000001s)]
*  and the dial can be turned up. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=539.0400000000001s)]
*  And so we could either strike at some of these camps [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=542.0400000000001s)]
*  or areas where we know these militia groups [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=548.04s)]
*  are headquartered or operate. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=552.48s)]
*  We could strike at supply nodes [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=555.24s)]
*  where the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, the IRDC, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=559.4399999999999s)]
*  is handing off material or weapons to these types of groups. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=562.76s)]
*  And actually, the Israelis frequently strike [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=568.16s)]
*  targets like that in Lebanon and Syria and Iraq. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=570.3199999999999s)]
*  Or here are some strikes into Iran, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=573.88s)]
*  if you really want to escalate. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=579.56s)]
*  And I imagine they're looking at things like sanctions, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=581.36s)]
*  which I think are useless at this point, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=584.24s)]
*  because how many sanctions can you put on these groups? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=586.24s)]
*  Cyber actions. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=591.48s)]
*  But the kind of discussion that you're having is, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=594.4s)]
*  well, what would this do? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=596.16s)]
*  What would the, you're trying to game out [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=598.0s)]
*  what the response would be from the Iranians [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=600.1999999999999s)]
*  or from some of these other groups. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=603.04s)]
*  You're hearing the views represented, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=605.92s)]
*  not just on television, but here's what Congress is saying. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=608.3199999999999s)]
*  And you're kind of weighing what might be the point [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=611.8s)]
*  of engaging in this military activity [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=615.0799999999999s)]
*  versus what might the cost of potential escalation be. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=617.28s)]
*  And you're kind of trying to refine what the option is [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=621.8399999999999s)]
*  that the president's gonna choose. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=624.92s)]
*  And then at some point, you go through multiple levels [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=626.16s)]
*  of that same meeting, and then you meet with the president [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=630.36s)]
*  and have probably a couple rounds of, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=633.52s)]
*  here's some three, it's usually three options. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=636.76s)]
*  Well, Goldilocks. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=639.56s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's usually like the third one's crazy [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=640.4s)]
*  and the first one is minimalist. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=642.8s)]
*  This conflict is too high. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=644.08s)]
*  It's often kind of teed up that way. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=646.12s)]
*  And I'm not saying that's the best way [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=647.84s)]
*  to do these things, by the way. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=649.8s)]
*  And so I think they've been going through that exercise. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=651.1999999999999s)]
*  Now, what's different in this case [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=652.64s)]
*  than when I was in the Situation Room is the wars in Gaza. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=654.4s)]
*  And we don't hold all these cards. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=658.72s)]
*  Not only do we not know exactly what they're thinking [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=661.96s)]
*  in Tehran or how much control the Iranians have [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=663.8000000000001s)]
*  over these groups, and I'm quite dubious, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=667.72s)]
*  and I'm sure Ali gets into this. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=669.2s)]
*  Yeah, we get into that a lot. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=670.52s)]
*  I don't think that the Iranians are sitting there [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=671.36s)]
*  ordering attacks in these US forces, but put that aside, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=673.52s)]
*  we don't control what the main theater of this war is. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=677.28s)]
*  We don't, obviously, Bibi Netanyahu is controlling [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=680.64s)]
*  the Israeli military operation there. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=684.1600000000001s)]
*  And so that's part of the challenge and the problem [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=686.6800000000001s)]
*  with this whole dynamic is that we can't control [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=690.44s)]
*  for escalation and de-escalation in kind of the main theater. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=694.8000000000001s)]
*  Or we can, I guess, if we use our leverage on Israel [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=697.84s)]
*  to try to really de-escalate. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=701.0s)]
*  And so it feels, something about the whole exercise [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=702.88s)]
*  feels off to me. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=708.52s)]
*  Like, what are we doing here? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=709.4s)]
*  What is this all about? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=711.32s)]
*  What strategies is connected to? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=712.36s)]
*  There's kind of a Washington drama of like, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=714.84s)]
*  well, they did some things, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=716.92s)]
*  and now we have to really do something. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=718.3199999999999s)]
*  And I question the premise of what is achieved [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=719.64s)]
*  by these military options, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=723.92s)]
*  because they're not deterring these groups. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=726.64s)]
*  And I would actually argue, I think these groups [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=729.16s)]
*  want us to do things, say, in Iraq, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=732.12s)]
*  in ways that call the Iraqi government to say, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=735.36s)]
*  get out of here. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=737.28s)]
*  So this whole thing just feels very tenuous to me. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=738.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Ali and I get into the different motivations [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=741.36s)]
*  for some of these different groups, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=743.6s)]
*  how much Iran controls them, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=744.5600000000001s)]
*  the fiction of deterring Iran [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=746.12s)]
*  that was talked about constantly in Washington. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=748.84s)]
*  Here's a clip of White House spokesman John Kirby [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=751.72s)]
*  talking about the need to respond. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=754.5600000000001s)]
*  We're gonna take this seriously as well. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=756.24s)]
*  We've got to do what we have to do [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=757.8000000000001s)]
*  to protect our troops and our facilities. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=759.0s)]
*  What the options are available to the president, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=760.96s)]
*  we're still working through that. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=763.08s)]
*  He's still working his way through that. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=764.72s)]
*  And I don't wanna close down any decision space [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=766.48s)]
*  on his behalf. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=768.84s)]
*  That said, we certainly know Iran's back in these groups. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=770.0s)]
*  We know that they are resourcing, they're supplying. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=773.9200000000001s)]
*  In some cases, they're providing information [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=776.0400000000001s)]
*  that allows these groups to do this. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=777.7600000000001s)]
*  We're taking that very seriously. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=779.6800000000001s)]
*  We don't want a wider war with Iran. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=780.8000000000001s)]
*  We don't want a wider war in the region. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=783.36s)]
*  But we gotta do what we have to do. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=785.6s)]
*  There was another quote out there from Tony Blinken [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=786.8000000000001s)]
*  who said, this is an incredibly volatile time [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=788.32s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=790.44s)]
*  I would argue that we've not seen a situation [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=791.2800000000001s)]
*  as dangerous as the one we're facing now [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=792.9200000000001s)]
*  across the region since at least 1973. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=794.8000000000001s)]
*  And arguably, even before that, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=797.6s)]
*  there's also reports, Ben, that the US is debating [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=800.4000000000001s)]
*  whether to fully pull US troops out of Iraq and Syria. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=803.04s)]
*  I imagine this incident in Jordan [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=806.48s)]
*  will lead a lot of people to wonder, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=809.12s)]
*  why are US troops in Jordan? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=810.88s)]
*  Why are US troops in Syria? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=812.32s)]
*  Why are US troops in ISIS? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=813.68s)]
*  The Pentagon will likely say they're there [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=815.16s)]
*  to prevent a resurgence of ISIS. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=817.84s)]
*  We saw what happened when the US pulled out of Iraq [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=820.08s)]
*  and we had to go back in. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=822.16s)]
*  But I do think that that's a conversation [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=823.48s)]
*  that probably needs to happen. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=825.48s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot there that I find concerning. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=828.1999999999999s)]
*  If you listen to Kirby's, I think, accurate description [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=833.68s)]
*  of their policy, I think there's a contradiction [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=839.0s)]
*  at the heart of it, which is we don't want a wider war, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=841.88s)]
*  but we are engaged in a wider war. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=843.68s)]
*  And that's where I think they need to stop [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=846.52s)]
*  just reacting to events and step back [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=850.56s)]
*  and be like, what is actually in, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=852.36s)]
*  what's the right thing to do here? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=853.92s)]
*  What's in our interest? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=855.16s)]
*  Because there's a quicksand feeling to what's happening [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=856.72s)]
*  where they're getting drawn into a conflict [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=861.9200000000001s)]
*  by all these various groups that are, again, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=864.6s)]
*  playing off of what's happening in Gaza [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=868.84s)]
*  to take on what they see as the US and Israel [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=870.48s)]
*  and the region, and I think they need to step back [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=873.6800000000001s)]
*  and consider whether this is working, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=876.5600000000001s)]
*  kind of going back and forth like that with these groups [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=880.36s)]
*  and thinking you're controlling the escalation, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=882.4000000000001s)]
*  because the escalation is just ticking up and up and up. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=884.0s)]
*  I think on the troops in Syria point, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=886.8000000000001s)]
*  we shouldn't have these troops in Syria, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=889.1600000000001s)]
*  and I think that they were debating that for years [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=891.32s)]
*  inside the administration, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=893.6800000000001s)]
*  and it's always hard to pull them out, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=894.76s)]
*  and this is why it's hard to pull them out, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=896.24s)]
*  because you have these troops in a pretty vulnerable place. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=897.6s)]
*  Like you were talking about 500 or 1,000 US service members, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=902.2800000000001s)]
*  and the counter-ISIS mission, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=907.2800000000001s)]
*  it's not like there's no remnant of ISIS anywhere, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=910.6s)]
*  but I don't think you need those troops here anymore. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=912.96s)]
*  I don't think you've needed them for a few years. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=914.36s)]
*  And when you don't pull them out [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=917.72s)]
*  because you're kind of delaying a hard decision [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=920.96s)]
*  or you might get criticized, and then this happens, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=924.44s)]
*  but then you're like, well, we can't possibly [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=928.64s)]
*  pull them out now because then the Iranians [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=929.9200000000001s)]
*  or their groups will declare victory, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=931.76s)]
*  and that's such a bad reason to put people at risk. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=933.08s)]
*  If they're not serving a function [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=940.0400000000001s)]
*  other than potentially being a target for these groups, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=941.72s)]
*  and then what are they doing there? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=945.4s)]
*  So I think they have to step back and think about [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=946.6s)]
*  what kind of footprint do we want in this region? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=949.6s)]
*  How much do we want to get drawn into these conflicts? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=951.9200000000001s)]
*  And I'd say we should be narrowly protecting, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=954.2s)]
*  okay, if you want to protect ships [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=957.72s)]
*  that are going through the Red Sea, just do it there. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=958.96s)]
*  You don't need to be attacking the Houthis, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=961.36s)]
*  so you're not going to deter. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=962.76s)]
*  You obviously need to protect US military installations, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=965.48s)]
*  but think carefully about where they need to be, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=968.12s)]
*  and don't let these groups control your own policies. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=970.68s)]
*  In other words, don't get drawn into a fight [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=976.04s)]
*  that is not worth it to have. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=979.8s)]
*  We can get into the politics of this too, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=981.56s)]
*  because I actually think the politics run counter [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=983.0s)]
*  to what people probably think it is. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=985.4s)]
*  Yeah, let's talk about the politics. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=986.68s)]
*  I think there's about 900 US troops in Syria. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=987.52s)]
*  There's another couple thousand in Iraq. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=989.64s)]
*  It sounds like the US and Iraq are going to negotiate [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=992.4399999999999s)]
*  on the future of that force presence, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=995.56s)]
*  but again, this idea that you can deter [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=997.28s)]
*  an Iranian-backed militia based in Iraq, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=999.68s)]
*  whose primary mission seems to be driving the US [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1002.92s)]
*  out of Iraq seems to be logically wrong to me, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1005.68s)]
*  but we talked more about that with Ali. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1009.0s)]
*  But Ben, to your point about Washington, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1010.9599999999999s)]
*  there is the bipartisan blob pressure [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1013.1999999999999s)]
*  on Biden to respond military. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1016.0s)]
*  I'll tick through some of that. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1017.52s)]
*  So on the Democratic side, you get Senator Ben Cardin, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1018.3599999999999s)]
*  the Democratic chair [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1021.16s)]
*  of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1022.0s)]
*  I support President Biden in a deliberate [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1023.9599999999999s)]
*  and proportionate response. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1025.96s)]
*  Senator Jack Reed, who is in charge [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1027.6s)]
*  of the Armed Services Committee use similar language. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1029.28s)]
*  Nick Kristof, a liberal New York Times columnist tweeted, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1031.6799999999998s)]
*  quote, I hope Biden's response this time is much tougher [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1036.7s)]
*  striking either Iranian territory or its naval assets. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1038.96s)]
*  Iran can be deterred if it feels sufficient pain. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1041.8799999999999s)]
*  I didn't realize that Brett Stevens has stolen his pen. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1044.56s)]
*  Co-author of Half the Sky, like, come on, man. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1047.52s)]
*  The Republican comments were more overtly bloodthirsty. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1049.9199999999998s)]
*  You got Lindsey Graham tweeting, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1052.6799999999998s)]
*  hit Iran now, hit them hard. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1054.3999999999999s)]
*  Tom Cotton called for a quote, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1056.52s)]
*  devastating military retaliation, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1058.04s)]
*  both in Iran and across the Middle East. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1059.8799999999999s)]
*  Anything less will confirm Joe Biden as a coward, end quote. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1061.94s)]
*  Nikki Haley called Biden weak. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1065.66s)]
*  She demanded a retaliation. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1068.24s)]
*  So lots of pressure to escalate the war. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1069.68s)]
*  There's some notable exceptions I did wanna flag. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1071.48s)]
*  Congressman Seth Moulton of Massachusetts served in Iraq, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1074.12s)]
*  did four tours, said, quote, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1076.94s)]
*  to the chicken hawks who are calling for war with Iran, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1078.92s)]
*  you're playing into the enemy's hands [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1081.02s)]
*  and I'd like to see you send your sons and daughters [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1082.68s)]
*  to fight, Moulton said. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1084.6s)]
*  We must have an effective strategic response on our terms [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1085.84s)]
*  and on our timeline. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1088.76s)]
*  Grateful for voices like that in crazy times like this. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1090.1999999999998s)]
*  Tucker Carlson called Lindsey Graham and John Cornyn, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1093.72s)]
*  Senator from Texas, quote, fucking lunatics, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1097.58s)]
*  for demanding Biden strike Iran. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1100.08s)]
*  Shout out Tucker. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1102.9199999999998s)]
*  Stop clock is right, you know, twice a day. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1103.76s)]
*  Trump called Biden weak. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1106.6399999999999s)]
*  He said this wouldn't have happened if Trump was president, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1108.1599999999999s)]
*  which is what he always says. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1111.6s)]
*  But I don't think he has outlined [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1113.0s)]
*  what he specifically wants to see as a response. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1114.64s)]
*  So the political challenges are basically [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1117.0400000000002s)]
*  like one consideration, right, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1120.5200000000002s)]
*  is like people say you gotta look tough, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1122.48s)]
*  you gotta look strong, whatever the hell that means. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1124.68s)]
*  In DC, strength is usually defined by like [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1126.5200000000002s)]
*  schlubby columnists who's, you know, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1129.48s)]
*  close as they've gotten to war is playing call of duty [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1131.6000000000001s)]
*  with their friends or whatever. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1133.48s)]
*  Biden's gonna face some pressure from the left [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1135.2s)]
*  from anti-war progressives. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1136.96s)]
*  We love them for that effort, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1138.8400000000001s)]
*  but I don't know that those voices [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1141.3600000000001s)]
*  will be the loudest in the White House right now. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1143.24s)]
*  But the interesting wrinkle to me [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1147.04s)]
*  is this Tucker Carlson message, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1148.64s)]
*  which is that striking Iran itself is crazy. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1151.0s)]
*  We should get our troops out of Iraq and Syria. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1154.04s)]
*  Trump seems to be in mostly in the Tucker camp. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1156.4s)]
*  He's calling Biden weak, but he's not detailing a response. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1160.36s)]
*  Like, I don't know, what do you think [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1163.32s)]
*  the political incentives are here for Biden? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1164.76s)]
*  Cause it's getting a little muddled. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1167.36s)]
*  I'd say three things Tommy, I've thought about this a lot. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1169.1200000000001s)]
*  First of all, you know, Lindsey Graham and Tom Cotton, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1171.72s)]
*  there hasn't been a problem in the last decade [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1174.92s)]
*  that their answer to that problem wasn't [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1177.08s)]
*  to call a Democratic weak, sorry, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1179.1200000000001s)]
*  to call a Democrat weak and say that we should bomb Iran. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1180.96s)]
*  Like this is a comic book bullshit. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1183.2s)]
*  It's like John Bolton, same thing. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1184.84s)]
*  Yeah, and like, so I just block those people out. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1186.16s)]
*  They're not serious people, this is what they do. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1189.76s)]
*  It's like one trick pony bullshit, right? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1192.88s)]
*  And that leads to the second most important point, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1194.8s)]
*  which is that my experience in eight years in the White House [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1197.12s)]
*  is that the best politics in foreign policy [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1201.8s)]
*  are actually the outcome, not the posturing. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1205.1999999999998s)]
*  And the outcome of getting into a war with Iran [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1207.72s)]
*  is a terrible political outcome. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1210.36s)]
*  Americans would fucking hate that. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1212.36s)]
*  By the way, Lindsey Graham and Tom Cotton [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1213.9199999999998s)]
*  probably know that, you know, they're goading Biden [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1215.48s)]
*  to do something that would be politically devastating, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1217.1599999999999s)]
*  but in line with their ideology. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1219.4399999999998s)]
*  And so this is where the politics of national screen [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1221.08s)]
*  in Washington is so profoundly out of touch [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1224.44s)]
*  with actual American voters, because in Washington, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1227.68s)]
*  they think that like what Lindsey Graham is saying about you [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1230.76s)]
*  actually matters to your politics. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1232.92s)]
*  It doesn't fucking matter. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1234.2s)]
*  Like, there's no voter, Lindsey Graham ran for president [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1235.6000000000001s)]
*  and got like- [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1238.24s)]
*  But then he was on Face the Nation. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1239.0800000000002s)]
*  He was on like the JV, remember those JV debates? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1240.2s)]
*  He never even got on like the main debate in 2016. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1243.2800000000002s)]
*  But then he spoke at Brookings. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1245.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's the thing. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1246.3200000000002s)]
*  And everybody thinks that this is a big political problem [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1247.16s)]
*  because he's on like Sunday shows [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1249.2s)]
*  that like barely anybody watches anymore. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1252.0400000000002s)]
*  And he like is quoted in some legacy media [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1254.8400000000001s)]
*  that 90% of people like don't read anymore. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1258.6000000000001s)]
*  Don't talk about the Atlantic that way. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1261.7600000000002s)]
*  Well, look, I write for the Atlantic and I'm on MSNBC. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1263.2800000000002s)]
*  So like, I get it, but like, I don't think that [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1265.8000000000002s)]
*  that's not where like Democrats don't like wars. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1269.8000000000002s)]
*  I totally agree. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1272.8400000000001s)]
*  Republicans don't either. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1273.68s)]
*  Yes, the Tucker Carlson- [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1274.68s)]
*  A lot of them fought in them. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1275.5200000000002s)]
*  Is much closer to the base of the Republican party [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1276.5200000000002s)]
*  than Lindsey Graham is. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1279.1200000000001s)]
*  And so it's such a mistake to even consider [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1280.68s)]
*  those viewpoints as political pressure. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1283.0400000000002s)]
*  The political pressure is to not end up in a war [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1285.3200000000002s)]
*  that you don't wanna be fighting. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1288.6000000000001s)]
*  And to be specific, again, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1290.44s)]
*  I think the Biden people's options are to not do this [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1292.6000000000001s)]
*  and to do, look, politically the best outcome [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1296.3200000000002s)]
*  for where this thing could be [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1300.4s)]
*  is that there's a ceasefire in Gaza, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1302.16s)]
*  the hostages come back, you're getting aid into Gaza. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1304.0s)]
*  So like things are getting better for the people there. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1307.3200000000002s)]
*  And we're not in a war, right? [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1309.56s)]
*  So that's both the best substantive outcome [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1311.48s)]
*  and the best political outcome. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1313.92s)]
*  And just cause that doesn't track the DC playbook [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1315.48s)]
*  of like, we gotta support Bibi and hug him and we gotta, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1317.6s)]
*  like, that's the wrong political outlook. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1320.44s)]
*  You know, in the back of their minds, they're thinking, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1323.08s)]
*  okay, we said we shall respond. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1324.76s)]
*  Obama did the red line. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1326.96s)]
*  He got destroyed for not bombing Syria. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1328.28s)]
*  So that's the one thing floating around here, right? [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1330.28s)]
*  The second thing floating around the back of their heads [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1332.32s)]
*  is the Afghanistan withdrawal. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1334.0s)]
*  So they know it's time to get troops out of places [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1335.52s)]
*  like Iraq and Syria, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1337.76s)]
*  but they're obviously and understandably scarred [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1339.36s)]
*  by what happened in Afghanistan. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1342.04s)]
*  And then three is kind of like the APAC politics of Israel, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1343.92s)]
*  traditional thing, right? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1348.04s)]
*  So like, those I imagine are like looming super large [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1348.8799999999999s)]
*  in the heads of decision makers right now. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1352.44s)]
*  I'm not saying that's the right thing to be thinking about, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1354.4s)]
*  but I think that's what I think they're probably thinking about. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1356.12s)]
*  And I'm saying I think they need to get that [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1357.4s)]
*  out of their heads. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1358.8s)]
*  I mean, the red line thing made it, you know, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1359.64s)]
*  like hugely controversial in elite circles, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1362.52s)]
*  but like, did that hurt Barack Obama's political standing? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1366.0s)]
*  No, and so we don't have to, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1368.6s)]
*  there's not to debate that whether that was right or wrong. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1370.76s)]
*  It's just to make the point that like, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1372.92s)]
*  it was never the political cost on Barack Obama [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1374.48s)]
*  that like national security elites like thought it was, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1377.4s)]
*  cause they were so divorced from public opinion. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1381.36s)]
*  Public opinion didn't want to be in war in Syria, you know? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1383.4s)]
*  Then the APAC stuff is profoundly insane [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1385.92s)]
*  because Bibi Netanyahu does not want Joe Biden to get elected. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1389.68s)]
*  We've covered all this, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1392.28s)]
*  but it bears repeating that like, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1394.3600000000001s)]
*  that should literally not enter into the head of Democrats. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1396.48s)]
*  APAC is an organization that like is endorsing insurrectionists [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1399.8s)]
*  and the prime minister of Israel is clearly in favor [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1404.04s)]
*  of Donald Trump in this next election. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1407.3600000000001s)]
*  So why would you let them dictate your political [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1408.68s)]
*  or national security strategy, you know? [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1412.0s)]
*  And then Afghanistan, look, the problem in Afghanistan [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1414.04s)]
*  was not, I think, the biggest problem in Afghanistan [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1416.24s)]
*  was just how that went, you know? [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1419.0s)]
*  It's just a different situation. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1420.84s)]
*  It's apples to oranges. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1421.96s)]
*  When you're trying to kind of shape your current decisions [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1423.5200000000002s)]
*  to kind of make up for something you did in the past, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1426.92s)]
*  I think that, you know, taking 500 troops out of Syria [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1428.5600000000002s)]
*  is a different kind of enterprise [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1432.2s)]
*  than what we saw in Afghanistan. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1433.48s)]
*  I do think on Trump, the problem with Trump, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1435.0800000000002s)]
*  and he's too dumb to know it, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1438.24s)]
*  is yes, he didn't like start, then bomb Iran, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1439.72s)]
*  but he killed Qasem Soleimani. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1443.88s)]
*  He assassinated the commander, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1446.0800000000002s)]
*  the revered commander of the IRGC, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1447.8400000000001s)]
*  and a lot of what we're seeing now [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1450.8000000000002s)]
*  is a lot of groups have been waiting [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1453.56s)]
*  to kind of get their revenge on the US, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1454.68s)]
*  and this Gaza war has been the opening for that, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1457.3600000000001s)]
*  and so he's part of this too, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1460.3600000000001s)]
*  because he literally did a major escalation to the IRGC [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1462.2s)]
*  that escalated this regional war [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1465.68s)]
*  in ways that we're still seeing, I think. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1467.6000000000001s)]
*  And it's worth pointing out, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1469.24s)]
*  the Republicans say, and the press repeats it [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1470.64s)]
*  as an article of fact, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1473.16s)]
*  that killing Qasem Soleimani restored US deterrence, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1475.44s)]
*  and it quieted the Iranian proxy groups. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1479.04s)]
*  That is absolutely not true. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1481.24s)]
*  Attacks increased in the calendar year [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1483.16s)]
*  after the Soleimani strike, above the one before it. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1485.64s)]
*  Don't trust me, the quote here is from General Frank McKenzie, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1488.32s)]
*  the commander of US Central Command. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1492.52s)]
*  He said, we have had more indirect fire attacks [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1493.84s)]
*  around and against our bases in the first half of this year [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1496.16s)]
*  than we did in the first half of last year. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1498.68s)]
*  So, yeah, pretty clear there. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1500.56s)]
*  Remember, in September of 2020, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1503.0s)]
*  Mike Pompeo threatened to close the US embassy in Iraq [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1505.44s)]
*  because their threats were so high. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1508.24s)]
*  In December of 2020, December 23rd, 2020, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1510.2s)]
*  there was the largest rocket attack [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1513.6000000000001s)]
*  on the US embassy in Iraq in a decade. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1515.0800000000002s)]
*  So, in fact, like all these proxy groups [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1517.52s)]
*  increased their activities, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1520.16s)]
*  increased their attacks on US forces [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1521.44s)]
*  after the Soleimani assassination. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1522.92s)]
*  It didn't chill them out at all. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1524.64s)]
*  Yeah, and that, what drives me crazy [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1526.0s)]
*  is that line of argument. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1529.92s)]
*  We need to restore deterrence. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1533.2s)]
*  We need to punish Iran for its malign activities [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1535.32s)]
*  in the region. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1537.8s)]
*  We need to apply maximum pressure. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1538.64s)]
*  So, the Iranian nuclear program [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1541.16s)]
*  is never really scrutinized. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1542.52s)]
*  It's never questioned. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1544.3600000000001s)]
*  It's never questioned because it's like, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1545.2s)]
*  it's quote unquote tough, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1546.52s)]
*  even though it brings about the opposite outcomes, right? [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1547.3600000000001s)]
*  That approach leads to a more advanced Iranian nuclear program, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1550.44s)]
*  more hostile Iranian proxy groups. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1553.8000000000002s)]
*  It doesn't work. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1555.52s)]
*  And so, like the efficacy and the results should matter here [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1556.8400000000001s)]
*  and it should guide whether or not the administration [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1561.76s)]
*  kind of lets those people write its playbook [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1564.24s)]
*  or whether they are able to find a pathway [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1566.88s)]
*  One argument you can make against US involvement [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1569.9199999999998s)]
*  in the Middle East is that the buildup there [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1572.3999999999999s)]
*  of US military assets has already cost $1.6 billion. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1574.56s)]
*  I don't think people like that kind of spending. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1578.12s)]
*  In a sign that foreign policy is complicated, Ben, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1580.52s)]
*  the Wall Street Journal reported that the US warned Iran [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1583.36s)]
*  in advance of that January 3rd ISIS attack [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1586.84s)]
*  that killed 80 Iranians that coincided [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1590.0s)]
*  with the death of Qasem Soleimani's assassination. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1592.1999999999998s)]
*  This might surprise listeners, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1595.24s)]
*  but the US intelligence community, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1596.76s)]
*  it works under a directive called the duty to warn [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1598.96s)]
*  that requires them to warn Americans and non-Americans [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1601.24s)]
*  if they're gonna be the target of a terrorist attack. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1604.1599999999999s)]
*  So maybe some more diplomacy like that [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1606.6399999999999s)]
*  could get us in a better place. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1608.68s)]
*  It's just an interesting side note. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1610.84s)]
*  And then as long as we're talking about [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1612.1599999999999s)]
*  the Senate and congressional committees, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1613.84s)]
*  I do hope the Senate will get moving [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1615.76s)]
*  on some of their nominations. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1617.24s)]
*  There's great folks sitting out there like Derek Chalet [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1618.52s)]
*  to be a top Pentagon official. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1621.6s)]
*  He's just waiting for a confirmation hearing. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1623.48s)]
*  You got state and DOD jobs just sitting vacant. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1625.76s)]
*  So let's get moving here. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1628.08s)]
*  Let's get rid of Bob Menendez [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1629.32s)]
*  and get moving on some nominations. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1630.8799999999999s)]
*  That's our ask. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1632.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you're talking about [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1633.0s)]
*  an incredibly volatile international environment [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1634.12s)]
*  and you've got, yeah, Derek is up to be [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1636.24s)]
*  the lead policy person in the Pentagon. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1638.4399999999998s)]
*  You've got diplomats. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1640.4399999999998s)]
*  Democrats can push this through the Senate [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1641.8799999999999s)]
*  and they need to do it. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1643.76s)]
*  I mean, now is not a good time to have a bunch of vacancies [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1644.6s)]
*  and actings in different places. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1648.48s)]
*  Give Joe Biden his team. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1650.56s)]
*  Okay, so let's turn to Gaza [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1652.28s)]
*  because the latest crisis facing Gazans [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1653.6399999999999s)]
*  is the status of funding for the United Nations [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1655.8s)]
*  Relief and Works Agency for Palestine or UNRWA. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1658.16s)]
*  Israel says that at least 12 UNRWA employees [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1661.48s)]
*  crossed into Israel on October 7th [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1664.52s)]
*  and participated in the Hamas terrorist attack. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1666.28s)]
*  Israeli intelligence also claims that 10% [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1668.96s)]
*  of UNRWA's Gaza-based staff are Hamas members. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1671.96s)]
*  This latter claim, the more expansive claim, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1675.48s)]
*  is reportedly based on cross-referencing [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1677.56s)]
*  an UNRWA staff list with a directory of Hamas members [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1680.08s)]
*  that the IDF found on some computer in Gaza. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1683.44s)]
*  I think we need to see a lot more evidence [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1685.92s)]
*  to back up this 10% figure, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1687.72s)]
*  but the specific allegations against these 12 individuals [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1689.4s)]
*  are very serious and very troubling. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1693.5600000000002s)]
*  It includes allegations that an UNRWA worker [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1695.96s)]
*  kidnapped a woman and then another participated [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1698.0s)]
*  in a massacre at Israeli kibbutz on October 7th. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1700.72s)]
*  Nine of these 12 employees have been fired. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1704.8000000000002s)]
*  One is dead, two are being investigated. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1706.68s)]
*  In response, though, the US and now about a dozen countries [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1709.2s)]
*  suspended funding for UNRWA. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1712.68s)]
*  That is an enormous decision because 80% of Gazans [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1715.0800000000002s)]
*  have been displaced by the war, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1717.8400000000001s)]
*  and now the UN is providing shelter [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1719.1200000000001s)]
*  to about 1.4 million people in 150,000 locations, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1721.2s)]
*  and they're also providing general assistance [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1725.1200000000001s)]
*  to about 400,000 more. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1727.2800000000002s)]
*  The UN says their funding could run out [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1728.68s)]
*  by the end of February if the US and other donors [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1731.5600000000002s)]
*  don't reverse course. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1734.3200000000002s)]
*  The US and Germany provide about half [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1735.72s)]
*  of UNRWA's $1.2 billion budget in 2022. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1737.96s)]
*  So before the war started, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1741.92s)]
*  UNRWA employed about 13,000 employees in Gaza. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1744.24s)]
*  Most of them were teachers and about 30,000 [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1747.0s)]
*  in the broader Middle East. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1749.0400000000002s)]

*  Here's a clip. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1760.1200000000001s)]
*  Suspending UNRWA funding will have a catastrophic impact [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1760.96s)]
*  on the humanitarian situation in Gaza. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1764.0s)]
*  Already around 1.7 million out of Gaza's 2.3 million people [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1767.2s)]
*  have been internally displaced. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1772.92s)]
*  The majority of them, around a million, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1775.28s)]
*  are seeking shelter in and around UNRWA facilities [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1777.68s)]
*  and are reliant on UNRWA to provide them with everything [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1780.76s)]
*  from shelter to water to food to toilet. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1784.3200000000002s)]
*  UNRWA is also playing a huge role [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1790.3600000000001s)]
*  in the distribution of aid throughout Gaza. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1792.68s)]
*  Around 80% of aid that's being distributed right now [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1795.84s)]
*  is being distributed through UNRWA. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1799.28s)]
*  On top of that, UNRWA provides support to other NGOs, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1802.9199999999998s)]
*  including the Norwegian Refugee Council. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1808.28s)]
*  UNRWA collects our goods when they cross [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1811.08s)]
*  through the Rafa Crossing and deliver them [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1815.6399999999999s)]
*  to NRC's warehouse in Rasa. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1818.1599999999999s)]
*  They also provide NRC and all the other humanitarian [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1821.36s)]
*  agencies operating in Gaza with fuel that's needed [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1827.48s)]
*  to power our vehicles to distribute the goods [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1830.96s)]
*  that we're receiving. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1834.8s)]
*  We've also, as the Norwegian Refugee Council, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1836.2s)]
*  relied on UNRWA to help deliver some of our aid [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1839.4399999999998s)]
*  to areas that we're unable to reach, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1843.52s)]
*  either because we don't have access [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1845.8s)]
*  due to ongoing hostilities [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1848.0s)]
*  or because we don't have staff available. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1850.88s)]
*  Just to give an idea for scale, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1853.92s)]
*  the Norwegian Refugee Council has around 50 staff [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1856.0800000000002s)]
*  in Gaza right now, not all of them are operational. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1860.4s)]
*  UNRWA in Gaza has a staff of 13,000 people [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1864.0800000000002s)]
*  with 3,000 people operational. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1867.92s)]
*  To cut off funding to UNRWA, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1870.5200000000002s)]
*  particularly at a time where there's so much desperate need, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1872.2800000000002s)]
*  is just punishing a civilian population [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1875.72s)]
*  that has already been suffering. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1878.2800000000002s)]
*  So, Ben, Israel's concerns about ties between UNRWA [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1880.2s)]
*  and Hamas or other militant groups are not new at all. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1884.28s)]
*  This new evidence is obviously very troubling, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1887.8400000000001s)]
*  but there's gotta be a better way to deal with [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1889.72s)]
*  these bad actors than to fully cut off support [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1894.32s)]
*  to two million people in Gaza [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1897.6000000000001s)]
*  when it is so clearly desperately needed, right? [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1899.3600000000001s)]
*  I mean, there's gotta be some space here [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1901.3600000000001s)]
*  between cutting them off and nothing. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1903.88s)]
*  Yeah, now look, these people did what they did. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1905.96s)]
*  It's horrific. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1910.24s)]
*  I do think you have, you know, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1912.56s)]
*  this isn't like a finite, small UN team, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1915.28s)]
*  like you said, it was before the wars, 13,000 people. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1920.64s)]
*  Basically, it's kind of like the public school system, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1924.1200000000001s)]
*  say, of Gaza. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1926.32s)]
*  And so, like, the capacity to kind of vet [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1927.16s)]
*  and monitor 13,000 people, yes, they need to investigate it. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1930.44s)]
*  You know, yes, they obviously should not have any role [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1934.8400000000001s)]
*  in this kind of violence. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1938.4s)]
*  But I just think this response is callous and crazy. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1940.84s)]
*  I mean, in the sense of like, okay, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1945.84s)]
*  you know, it is kind of like instinctive idea, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1950.04s)]
*  like, oh, we have to cut this off. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1952.08s)]
*  Well, now the US position is simultaneously, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1953.88s)]
*  we want there to be more aid into Gaza, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1957.56s)]
*  but we're gonna defund basically the overwhelmingly [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1960.08s)]
*  only delivery vehicle for that aid. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1966.4s)]
*  You're talking as you're over a million people [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1968.76s)]
*  like literally living in unretentious. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1970.64s)]
*  Where will they live? [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1972.92s)]
*  So, what are we doing here? [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1973.76s)]
*  If our policy is to get more assistance [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1976.6000000000001s)]
*  to people in Gaza who are suffering, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1979.24s)]
*  how can we do that if we're cutting off all the funding [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1981.24s)]
*  for the, now, I think there is a bit of a lag here [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1984.6000000000001s)]
*  in the sense of like the US money that's, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1987.76s)]
*  you know, the next tranches and for, you know, [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1990.0800000000002s)]
*  there's some time. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1991.6000000000001s)]
*  So, I think there's a capacity to kind of figure this out. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1992.44s)]
*  But the problem is if you accept the political premise [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=1997.16s)]
*  that we have to cut this off, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2000.68s)]
*  then what's gonna turn it back on? [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2003.16s)]
*  You know, the completion of investigation, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2005.88s)]
*  like what is the, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2008.44s)]
*  because if you can't find a way to turn it back on, [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2011.24s)]
*  how are you gonna get assistance? [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2013.2s)]
*  They saved the children in the region refugee council, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2014.8400000000001s)]
*  they joined a whole group [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2016.96s)]
*  of very established aid organizations, right? [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2017.96s)]
*  These are not like radical, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2020.24s)]
*  saying essentially we can't do it. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2022.16s)]
*  We can't take the place of UNRWA [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2023.52s)]
*  because they have all the infrastructure. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2025.76s)]
*  So, again, I think it doesn't make sense. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2027.4s)]
*  And the other thing I'd say even politically, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2032.68s)]
*  because, you know, that must have been a sense [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2036.2s)]
*  that there's some political pressure here. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2037.84s)]
*  I just wish that the political imperative [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2040.64s)]
*  of showing voters who care about what's happening in Gaza [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2042.76s)]
*  that you're trying to help those people, [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2048.6s)]
*  that that was taken into account in the same way that like, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2051.12s)]
*  oh, someone's gonna criticize us [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2053.96s)]
*  for continuing to provide funding to UNRWA. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2055.52s)]
*  The people that are gonna be mad at you [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2057.88s)]
*  for continuing to provide that assistance [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2059.52s)]
*  are probably not big Biden voters anyway. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2061.68s)]
*  So I just, I don't know, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2064.2s)]
*  like this whole thing kind of bugs me, you know? [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2065.36s)]
*  And it's not to justify anything about fucking what happened [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2067.04s)]
*  with these people that work there. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2070.52s)]
*  It's just a question of like, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2071.88s)]
*  we're in a situation now where like, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2073.48s)]
*  how else are we gonna get assistance in? [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2074.92s)]
*  By the way, I'd also say about this policy, you know, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2076.28s)]
*  leveling Gaza is probably not doing a lot to like. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2080.7999999999997s)]
*  De-radicalize? [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2083.7999999999997s)]
*  Exactly, like that 13,000 number, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2084.64s)]
*  there are probably more people, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2087.12s)]
*  and it's not to impugn them, I'm just saying that like, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2088.9599999999996s)]
*  how are you gonna be living under these bombs [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2092.2s)]
*  and be de-radical, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2094.4799999999996s)]
*  Bibi says he's de-radicalizing the population. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2096.04s)]
*  No, he's not, he's doing the opposite. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2098.7599999999998s)]
*  The absolute opposite is true, yeah. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2100.52s)]
*  I think you should find the individuals [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2101.8399999999997s)]
*  who are involved on the seventh, prosecute them, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2103.3199999999997s)]
*  and then keep investigating if you see people [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2106.56s)]
*  and then keep investigating if you could find others, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2108.88s)]
*  you shouldn't cut off aid to the entire organization. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2110.84s)]
*  By the way, in 2018, Trump defunded UNRWA [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2112.6400000000003s)]
*  in an effort to pressure the Palestinian authority [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2116.6800000000003s)]
*  into talks with Israel. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2118.8s)]
*  That effort completely failed, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2120.1200000000003s)]
*  so this has been tried before and it's just stupid. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2121.52s)]
*  Last thing on this, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2124.36s)]
*  did you see this report today that Reuters had [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2125.2000000000003s)]
*  about Israeli commandos disguised as medical workers [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2127.6000000000004s)]
*  like bursting into a hospital in the West Bank? [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2130.6400000000003s)]
*  They killed three Palestinian militants, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2132.88s)]
*  including one who's apparently paralyzed. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2134.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't have much to say about it [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2136.64s)]
*  beyond the fact that it seems like the kind of thing [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2138.2799999999997s)]
*  that could lead to an eruption in the West Bank, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2140.6s)]
*  so just something to watch. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2142.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it was, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2144.2s)]
*  they were dressed as doctors and veiled women, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2148.48s)]
*  and they killed these guys with silencers. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2151.12s)]
*  Now, these were Hamas and Islamic Jihad guys, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2153.92s)]
*  but there's a sense that there's no norms anymore. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2159.72s)]
*  Busting into a hospital and assassinating people [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2164.9599999999996s)]
*  is like, even if they are on your Hamas list, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2166.8799999999997s)]
*  is just, people say, and I hear this from Israelis sometimes, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2170.12s)]
*  well, you guys didn't, when you firebombed Dresden, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2178.04s)]
*  you didn't think twice about what you needed to do, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2181.7999999999997s)]
*  and it's like, well, yeah, but after World War II, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2183.6s)]
*  everybody got together and was like, [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2186.2s)]
*  this is why there need to be some rules. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2187.3199999999997s)]
*  And that, to me, is like, there's a sense of a breakdown [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2189.4599999999996s)]
*  of any rules or constraints or norms. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2192.0s)]
*  There's zero interest in the optics [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2194.72s)]
*  of any of these operations anywhere. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2196.24s)]
*  A couple more quick things. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2197.92s)]
*  So a couple weeks ago, I interviewed Ona Hathaway, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2198.76s)]
*  the director of the Center for Global Legal Challenges [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2201.8s)]
*  at Yale Law School. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2204.16s)]
*  We talked about the case before [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2205.32s)]
*  the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2206.44s)]
*  That was a really helpful interview in primer, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2209.6s)]
*  if you wanna go deeper on this issue, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2211.7s)]
*  but then last Friday, the ICJ issued a ruling [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2213.38s)]
*  that ordered Israel to do all it can [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2216.96s)]
*  to prevent death, destruction, and acts of genocide in Gaza, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2218.96s)]
*  but it stopped short of ordering Israel [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2221.92s)]
*  to end its military offensive. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2224.32s)]
*  The response to the ruling was a bit confusing. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2226.28s)]
*  Both sides seemed to be claiming victory in a sense. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2229.7200000000003s)]
*  So we checked back in with Ona to get her reaction [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2232.48s)]
*  and try to understand what it all means. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2235.08s)]
*  The very fact of this decision itself has an impact, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2236.6s)]
*  and I expect it will have an impact, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2240.48s)]
*  in that, first of all, it makes clear [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2243.36s)]
*  that the claims that had been made by South Africa [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2245.98s)]
*  are not completely off the wall. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2248.8s)]
*  That a court has looked at this carefully. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2251.8s)]
*  That pronouncement of the fact that 15 judges [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2254.7200000000003s)]
*  on the court out of 17 found that there is a plausible case [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2259.7200000000003s)]
*  that there's a violation of the Genocide Convention [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2264.5s)]
*  activates the obligations of every state [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2267.26s)]
*  that's party to the Genocide Convention, [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2269.4s)]
*  because the Genocide Convention requires [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2271.28s)]
*  that every state that is party to the convention [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2273.2000000000003s)]
*  not aid and assist genocide, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2275.4s)]
*  and also that they take active measures to prevent genocide. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2277.36s)]
*  So it should be causing substantial conversations [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2281.54s)]
*  in the states that are providing assistance, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2285.7s)]
*  Israel and its military. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2288.18s)]
*  So very interesting. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2289.86s)]
*  I mean, basically, it says the allegation [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2290.9s)]
*  that Israel violated the Genocide Convention are plausible, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2292.94s)]
*  but it will take years to rule if it actually took place. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2296.22s)]
*  But in the meantime, it could create real legal risk [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2300.98s)]
*  for the US if we continue to provide Israel [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2305.02s)]
*  with military assistance that's used in Gaza. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2307.34s)]
*  And Ona also makes the point that if the US [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2310.8199999999997s)]
*  disregards what the ICJ says, in this instance, [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2313.22s)]
*  it really undercuts our arguments [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2316.3799999999997s)]
*  at other international forum [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2318.3199999999997s)]
*  about Russia's invasion of Ukraine. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2319.74s)]
*  Yeah, I think what this underscores is just how much [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2322.92s)]
*  this is a more long-term issue that's gonna play out. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2325.94s)]
*  There's a lot of drama and question [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2329.1s)]
*  about whether they would call for a ceasefire. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2330.8599999999997s)]
*  First of all, even if they did that, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2334.62s)]
*  there's no enforcement mechanism to go with it. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2336.7s)]
*  I think what this indicates is that there are gonna be [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2338.54s)]
*  years of varieties of cases being brought, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2341.58s)]
*  not just under the Genocide Convention, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2345.06s)]
*  but under other war crimes. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2347.74s)]
*  And the US is potentially gonna get drawn into those [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2350.22s)]
*  as the supplier of arms to Israel. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2352.54s)]
*  Yeah, so last Gaza piece, Ben. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2356.02s)]
*  So over the weekend, officials from the US, Israel, Qatar, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2357.54s)]
*  and Egypt met in Paris to try to hammer out [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2361.18s)]
*  a ceasefire proposal. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2363.2599999999998s)]
*  On Tuesday, a top official from Hamas said [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2364.64s)]
*  they were reviewing this proposal for a six-week ceasefire [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2366.9s)]
*  that would allow for a phased prisoner withdrawal, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2370.3s)]
*  starting with older hostages and then women and children. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2372.2200000000003s)]
*  The plan still needs to be relayed [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2375.26s)]
*  to Hamas's military leadership in Gaza, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2377.26s)]
*  who are likely, I don't know, in some tunnel, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2379.58s)]
*  like a hundred feet under the ground. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2381.6600000000003s)]
*  So it could take a while to hear back from them, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2383.64s)]
*  but fingers crossed that the two sides can come [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2385.54s)]
*  to an agreement on a ceasefire agreement [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2387.7400000000002s)]
*  and a hostage release deal, [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2389.6600000000003s)]
*  as the death toll now exceeds 26,000 people. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2391.54s)]
*  These peace talks were not helped [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2395.1800000000003s)]
*  when a recording of Netanyahu criticizing Qatar's leadership [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2396.7s)]
*  leaked to the press. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2400.2599999999998s)]
*  Axios also reported that officials from Saudi Arabia, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2401.7s)]
*  Jordan, Egypt, and the Palestinian Authority [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2404.7s)]
*  had a secret meeting in Riyadh nearly two weeks ago [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2407.06s)]
*  to coordinate on a plan for Gaza's reconstruction, [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2409.9399999999996s)]
*  which I think is probably positive. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2412.66s)]
*  But another Axios report said that 12 Israeli ministers, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2414.7799999999997s)]
*  including members of Netanyahu's Likud party, [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2418.7799999999997s)]
*  participated in a conference about rebuilding settlements [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2421.3399999999997s)]
*  in Gaza and displacing Palestinians. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2425.1s)]
*  So clearly Israel and the rest of the world [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2426.66s)]
*  are very far apart on the question [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2428.9399999999996s)]
*  of what Gaza looks like after the war. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2430.8599999999997s)]
*  Former speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2433.3399999999997s)]
*  had a surprising take on calls for a ceasefire in Gaza [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2435.4199999999996s)]
*  that are happening in the US. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2439.62s)]
*  Here's a clip from an interview she did on CNN [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2440.8999999999996s)]
*  over the weekend. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2443.62s)]
*  For them to call for a ceasefire is Mr. Putin's message. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2444.4599999999996s)]
*  Mr. Putin's message. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2449.62s)]
*  Make no mistake, this is directly connected [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2450.9399999999996s)]
*  to what he would like to see. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2453.94s)]
*  Same thing with Ukraine. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2456.1800000000003s)]
*  It's about Putin's message. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2458.02s)]
*  I think some of these protesters are spontaneous [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2460.26s)]
*  and organic and sincere. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2464.06s)]
*  Some, I think, are connected to Russia. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2466.14s)]
*  And I say that having looked at this for a long time now. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2468.94s)]
*  Some of these protests are Russian plants? [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2474.1s)]
*  These are plants I think some financing [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2476.78s)]
*  should be investigated. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2479.02s)]
*  So I guess I would not be surprised, Ben, [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2480.2200000000003s)]
*  if Russia is fanning the flames here, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2482.82s)]
*  promoting the Genocide Joe hashtag on social media. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2485.7400000000002s)]
*  I think the idea that Putin wants us to get to a ceasefire, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2488.6200000000003s)]
*  I don't know, I don't know that that's right. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2491.5400000000004s)]
*  He may very well want us bogged down in Gaza, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2492.7400000000002s)]
*  along with the Israelis, for a long time. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2495.7400000000002s)]
*  But I do think most importantly, [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2497.38s)]
*  it's not a great idea to suggest that. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2500.5800000000004s)]
*  I think very sincere concerns about a horrific war in Gaza, [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2502.78s)]
*  the death toll, are some sort of Russian disinformation play. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2507.0600000000004s)]
*  Even if the Russians are promoting these hashtags [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2511.02s)]
*  or whatever, I don't know, we'll find out someday. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2515.54s)]
*  Come on. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2518.14s)]
*  Yeah, again, I'm sure that the Russians, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2518.98s)]
*  every time there's something that's divisive [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2522.86s)]
*  in American society, every time they can draw wedges [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2524.54s)]
*  in the Democratic coalition or whatever, [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2527.62s)]
*  sure, they turbocharge their online information campaigns. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2530.02s)]
*  Probably attacking Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2534.7s)]
*  But that's my point. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2537.3s)]
*  That does not mean that they're responsible for the protest [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2538.54s)]
*  or the political views of people that are upset [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2542.54s)]
*  about what's happening in Gaza. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2544.78s)]
*  And there's two major problems with that. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2546.14s)]
*  One is when everything becomes about Russia and Putin, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2548.26s)]
*  it kind of undermines the stuff [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2551.74s)]
*  that really is concerning that they do. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2553.9s)]
*  I still believe that they met a lot in 2016, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2555.94s)]
*  I think they'll probably do it this time around, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2559.42s)]
*  and it may reach a level that is really concerning. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2560.74s)]
*  But when everything becomes about Putin's the hand behind [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2563.98s)]
*  that and this and that, it's a cried wolf piece of it. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2566.86s)]
*  But then more profoundly, it connects to what I was saying [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2571.5s)]
*  earlier about Anra, is that there's this kind of, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2574.06s)]
*  an ability to see, I remember, Tommy, [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2577.26s)]
*  with the Jewish community, actually, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2583.7400000000002s)]
*  I often had to engage in outreach of the Jewish community [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2585.1800000000003s)]
*  and somebody who helped us with that effort [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2589.1400000000003s)]
*  once had a good formulation to me, [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2594.06s)]
*  because he said, everybody in Washington [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2595.74s)]
*  tends to think about AIPAC, [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2597.4199999999996s)]
*  but I think about our door knockers, right? [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2600.1s)]
*  And by door knockers, he means the people that got out [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2603.46s)]
*  and organized and knocked on doors, [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2605.74s)]
*  who were super left wing on a bunch of stuff, [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2607.18s)]
*  or who were not even left wing, just progressive, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2610.2999999999997s)]
*  cared about the Palestinians. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2613.3799999999997s)]
*  And the fact that Speaker Pelosi and President Biden, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2614.66s)]
*  they're just not seeing these door knockers. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2619.18s)]
*  And that's politics as much as AIPAC [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2621.7s)]
*  and the person who calls you in. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2626.4199999999996s)]
*  And I'm almost astonished by the inability [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2628.3399999999997s)]
*  of the Democratic Party's leadership to realize [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2632.9399999999996s)]
*  that this is a big political problem. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2635.54s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure it's annoying when she has code pink [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2637.3399999999997s)]
*  going through her house in San Francisco, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2640.7799999999997s)]
*  screaming at her, I would not like that either. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2642.46s)]
*  You react on the human level sometimes, [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2644.8199999999997s)]
*  but I think that the motivations behind people [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2646.62s)]
*  want the war to end are profound and sincere [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2649.2599999999998s)]
*  and should be listened to and we'd all be better off. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2652.18s)]
*  Okay, we're gonna take a quick break, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2654.74s)]
*  but two quick things first, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2656.3399999999997s)]

*  All right, we have lots of NATO news. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2692.3799999999997s)]
*  Last week, Turkey's parliament voted to allow Sweden [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2693.98s)]
*  to join NATO, something that Erdogan said he agreed to [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2696.2999999999997s)]
*  last year and that leaves Hungary as the last holdout [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2698.74s)]
*  for Sweden's bid. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2701.7s)]
*  Finland joined NATO last year, [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2702.98s)]
*  putting the NATO alliance right on Russia's doorstep, [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2704.4199999999996s)]
*  which is exactly what Putin has been afraid of [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2707.38s)]
*  all these years and reportedly didn't want, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2710.06s)]
*  which is why a lot of people think he invaded Ukraine, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2712.32s)]
*  so a big self-own there. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2714.6600000000003s)]
*  The US has been a big supporter of Sweden's bid [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2716.1800000000003s)]
*  and now that Turkey's parliament voted in favor, [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2718.06s)]
*  the State Department announced a $23 billion sale [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2720.26s)]
*  of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey, [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2723.2200000000003s)]
*  which is a major part of the negotiations with Turkey [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2725.9s)]
*  that it dragged out for a while, [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2728.26s)]
*  were over these fighter jets. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2729.62s)]
*  Remember, the US got very pissed off, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2731.02s)]
*  when was that, a year or two ago? [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2733.02s)]
*  When the Turks agreed to buy Russian air defense systems, [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2734.7s)]
*  big dust up, anyway. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2737.8599999999997s)]
*  This comes as NATO countries are getting increasingly vocal [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2739.4199999999996s)]
*  about fears that Russia's invasion will not stop at Ukraine [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2742.3799999999997s)]
*  and will go to a NATO country. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2745.8599999999997s)]
*  You got military leaders in the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2747.4199999999996s)]
*  all voicing concerns about Russian aggression [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2750.68s)]
*  and there was a military commander in Estonia [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2753.1s)]
*  who said it's not a question of if but when Russia [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2755.98s)]
*  will try to invade them. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2758.3399999999997s)]
*  Obviously, this is all tied up with Ukraine's future. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2760.16s)]
*  The Washington Post reported that US officials [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2763.38s)]
*  are pivoting to a new strategy for Ukraine, [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2765.3s)]
*  one that focuses on fending off Russian advances, [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2767.6800000000003s)]
*  strengthening Ukraine's military for the long term, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2770.6600000000003s)]
*  but not retaking territory, [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2773.1400000000003s)]
*  so no counter surge like we saw last summer. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2775.5s)]
*  The Post says the administration hopes to release [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2779.3s)]
*  a 10-year plan this spring, [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2781.26s)]
*  but obviously that's dependent on Congress passing [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2783.26s)]
*  Biden's supplemental funding request for Ukraine [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2785.4s)]
*  and then obviously there's the US election. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2788.48s)]
*  Here's a recent clip of Donald Trump talking about NATO [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2790.66s)]
*  at a rally in Las Vegas. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2795.02s)]
*  Ukraine's an interesting case. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2796.58s)]
*  People always want to know my feeling. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2797.94s)]
*  Number one, we're in for 200 billion plus [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2799.8199999999997s)]
*  and the European nations are in for 20 billion [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2803.66s)]
*  and it's more important for them. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2806.8999999999996s)]
*  And don't you think they should equalize? [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2808.62s)]
*  Nobody asks them. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2810.54s)]
*  It's like I did with NATO. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2811.74s)]
*  I said, we're spending, we're paying for NATO [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2813.2599999999998s)]
*  and we don't get so much out of it. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2817.1s)]
*  And you know, I hate to tell you this about NATO. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2819.1s)]
*  If we ever needed their help, let's say we were attacked, [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2821.58s)]
*  I don't believe they'd be there. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2824.94s)]
*  I don't believe. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2827.02s)]
*  I know the people. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2827.86s)]
*  I know them. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2829.2599999999998s)]
*  I can tell you country by country who would be there [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2830.1s)]
*  but I don't believe they'd be there. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2832.86s)]
*  For the record, literally the opposite [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2835.14s)]
*  of what he just said is true. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2836.94s)]
*  NATO has invoked Article 5, [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2838.3399999999997s)]
*  its collective defense principle, [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2840.18s)]
*  only once in its history [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2841.58s)]
*  and that was after the September 11th attacks [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2842.7s)]
*  on behalf of the United States. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2845.42s)]
*  But that never stops Trump [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2846.94s)]
*  from repeating the same bullshit, [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2848.1s)]
*  same whining about NATO spending. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2850.06s)]
*  He's right about some of it but he's very annoying. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2852.2999999999997s)]
*  Ben, how do you think you're feeling [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2854.42s)]
*  about the future of NATO at this moment in time? [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2855.94s)]
*  Was Trump like, he ingested helium before he spoke? [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2860.1s)]
*  I couldn't tell if that was our recording [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2863.42s)]
*  coming through multiple systems [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2866.38s)]
*  but yeah, he did sound a little weird. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2867.7s)]
*  He's a little high. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2869.66s)]
*  I was like. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2870.5s)]
*  Maybe he's still getting some drugs from Dr. Rani. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2872.18s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2875.14s)]
*  So, look, a few things. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2876.34s)]
*  The Turkey thing is interesting [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2883.18s)]
*  because there's such a predictable cycle to this. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2884.42s)]
*  It's happened like 15 times to Erdogan now [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2888.94s)]
*  where there's some NATO decision has to be made [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2892.3s)]
*  and Erdogan says, I'm not sure I wanna do that [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2895.22s)]
*  and maybe I'm gonna buy something from Russia [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2897.54s)]
*  and the blob freaks out, like oh my God. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2899.62s)]
*  It was a fit. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2902.02s)]
*  When all it is is a normal like, you know, shake down, [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2903.58s)]
*  that Erdogan needs like, he wants some F-16s [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2906.7799999999997s)]
*  and so it's the same pattern. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2909.38s)]
*  I think what is more interesting here is like, [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2910.9s)]
*  Orban's growing willingness to just be a, [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2912.7s)]
*  because he's not even like Erdogan. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2918.1s)]
*  He's not trying to like shake you down for something. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2919.2599999999998s)]
*  He's just trying to show what a right wing asshole he is. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2920.86s)]
*  And that's gonna be a problem. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2925.02s)]
*  Skunk at the garden party. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2926.62s)]
*  I think on this Russian invasion fears, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2928.66s)]
*  look, I mean, the Estonians, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2931.02s)]
*  we dealt with this in the Obama years. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2932.54s)]
*  Some of the Baltic countries and all three of them, [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2934.98s)]
*  Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2938.74s)]
*  they have these Russian speaking populations [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2940.62s)]
*  that what they feared is a version of what started [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2944.9s)]
*  in Eastern Ukraine, which is suddenly there's [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2949.22s)]
*  quote unquote, separatists and I'm doing air quotes [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2950.86s)]
*  for the podcast listeners, which are essentially [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2953.62s)]
*  the Russians kind of starting some like, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2955.86s)]
*  seeming like popular movements to, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2958.02s)]
*  and then they have to come in and protect them. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2963.1s)]
*  And so look, but what all this comes down to, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2964.74s)]
*  to me is the US election. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2968.3s)]
*  I mean, if Joe Biden is reelected, [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2969.38s)]
*  NATO remains strong and I actually don't think [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2973.22s)]
*  that that scenarios of the Baltics being invaded [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2977.9s)]
*  are particularly likely. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2980.38s)]
*  And I think that Ukraine though, needs to figure out [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2981.86s)]
*  what is diplomacy or where is the war going [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2986.62s)]
*  that you're not gonna be able to take back a lot of territory [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2992.9s)]
*  and that's like a looming question that I think [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2994.58s)]
*  we can get into in the coming weeks. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2996.54s)]
*  But if Trump wins, I mean, listen to that guy. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=2998.22s)]
*  That guy doesn't have any commitment to NATO. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3001.5s)]
*  He'll either pull out of NATO or he'll kind of de facto [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3003.9s)]
*  not give a shit. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3006.5s)]
*  He's certainly not, they've already killed Joe Biden [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3007.74s)]
*  funding Ukraine. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3010.1s)]
*  I don't think Donald Trump's gonna be funding Ukraine. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3010.94s)]
*  And so there I do think the scenarios get worse [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3013.22s)]
*  in terms of like the Russians feeling emboldened [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3015.34s)]
*  and Ukraine, maybe the Russians feeling, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3017.6200000000003s)]
*  I'm not one of these guys is like, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3019.7400000000002s)]
*  they're gonna march into Europe at large, [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3020.6600000000003s)]
*  but like they might just start kind of fucking around [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3024.2200000000003s)]
*  on the borders of the Baltics. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3026.98s)]
*  Yeah, so it's understandable that these European countries [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3028.26s)]
*  are thinking about that now because spoiler alert, [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3032.54s)]
*  like most of them think Trump's gonna win. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3036.02s)]
*  And so they're like thinking, okay, [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3037.86s)]
*  what do we need to do here? [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3039.34s)]
*  Yeah, and I remember an episode a few months back, [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3040.5s)]
*  we walked through just how weak [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3042.34s)]
*  a lot of these European militaries are, [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3044.94s)]
*  the Germans, the British, I mean, [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3046.86s)]
*  they're just a shell of what they once were. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3049.2200000000003s)]
*  There's not a lot of infrastructure, [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3051.06s)]
*  so I bet they are concerned. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3052.06s)]
*  Sticking with our presumptive Republican nominee, Ben, [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3053.78s)]
*  so the Washington Post reported that Trump is considering [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3056.2200000000003s)]
*  various ways to launch a massive new trade war with China [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3058.82s)]
*  if he gets elected. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3062.34s)]
*  Trump has said publicly that he's considering [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3063.7000000000003s)]
*  revoking China's most favored nation status, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3065.54s)]
*  which could lead to tariffs on Chinese imports [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3067.7400000000002s)]
*  of more than 40%, but the Post says [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3069.86s)]
*  he has floated the idea of a flat 60% tariff [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3073.14s)]
*  on all Chinese imports and is considering [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3076.7s)]
*  a universal baseline tariff on basically all imported goods. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3078.98s)]
*  China accounts for nearly 12% of total US trade. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3082.74s)]
*  They're just after Canada and Mexico. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3086.2999999999997s)]
*  What's frustrating about all of this, Ben, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3088.7799999999997s)]
*  is we know that US consumers and US businesses [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3090.2999999999997s)]
*  are the ones who had to pay more because of Trump's tariffs, [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3093.8599999999997s)]
*  but it still helped him politically. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3097.2999999999997s)]
*  So Trump starts his trade war with China in 2018. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3099.14s)]
*  Farm sales to China collapse, so what does he do? [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3103.02s)]
*  He has the government, the USDA, write big checks to farmers, [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3106.1s)]
*  and I was out in Iowa, I heard him bragging about this. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3109.58s)]
*  He gets credit for being tough on China, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3112.54s)]
*  and he gets credit for taking care of the farmers. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3114.1s)]
*  It's like unbelievably frustrating. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3115.94s)]
*  So Biden has kept a lot of Trump's tariffs on China. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3117.42s)]
*  They've also taken a number of steps [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3121.74s)]
*  to limit China's access to sensitive technologies [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3123.66s)]
*  like semiconductors, but this protectionism from Trump [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3126.82s)]
*  and his claim that he's actually tough on China [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3131.06s)]
*  and the political salience of that argument [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3133.86s)]
*  is likely to be a big focus of the campaign. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3136.1800000000003s)]
*  Ben, what do you think the impact of a 60% [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3140.26s)]
*  across the board tariff on Chinese imports would be, [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3143.34s)]
*  and do you have thoughts on how we run [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3146.54s)]
*  against this nativist, populist rhetoric [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3148.2200000000003s)]
*  that plays pretty goddamn well in Iowa, from my experience? [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3151.5s)]
*  First of all, on the negative side, a 60% tariff, [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3154.66s)]
*  it's just a tax on Americans. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3157.38s)]
*  I mean, just that tariff will immediately get passed over [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3159.34s)]
*  into the prices that you're paying. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3162.3s)]
*  So it's like an inflation turbocharger. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3164.02s)]
*  And so I think there does need to be an effort to, [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3166.18s)]
*  and by the way, the American populist movement, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3169.38s)]
*  not to nerd out, but just because I've been reading about it, [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3172.66s)]
*  was founded in part because farmers understood [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3175.18s)]
*  that tariffs were taxes on them and drove the prices up. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3176.86s)]
*  So I think there has to be an ability to say [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3180.14s)]
*  this is the dumb wrong approach and will hurt people. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3183.8999999999996s)]
*  I think that the Biden people who've been quite hard ass [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3186.7799999999997s)]
*  on China have a story to tell that, yeah, [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3189.9799999999996s)]
*  not only have they kept some of these tariffs, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3193.18s)]
*  but they've tried to marry their domestic agenda, [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3194.4199999999996s)]
*  all these investments in infrastructure and clean energy [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3199.7s)]
*  and semiconductors and chips with their China policy, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3203.4599999999996s)]
*  which has been restricting the inputs of technology [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3208.8199999999997s)]
*  and investment into the Chinese tech sector [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3212.34s)]
*  and the Chinese semiconductor and AI industries. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3215.06s)]
*  And the story is basically like we are standing up for [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3218.06s)]
*  and protecting not only America's competitive edge [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3221.86s)]
*  against China, but also our capacity literally [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3224.9s)]
*  to kind of create jobs and advanced manufacturing [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3227.54s)]
*  for the future. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3231.3s)]
*  As democratic narratives are, [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3233.82s)]
*  it's a slightly more complicated one than six years. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3235.1400000000003s)]
*  But I think that they have to not assume that people, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3238.1000000000004s)]
*  I'd really try to tell that story [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3240.82s)]
*  over the course of the year. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3242.26s)]
*  I do wanna just quick detour, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3243.26s)]
*  because it's been pretty hard on the Biden people [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3244.86s)]
*  the last few weeks. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3247.38s)]
*  The six-pronged terror thing, and the NATO thing, [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3250.6600000000003s)]
*  the Trump presidency, first of all, total blank check [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3254.1000000000004s)]
*  to the far right Israeli government. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3257.38s)]
*  Oh my God, yes. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3260.34s)]
*  All bets off over there. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3261.5400000000004s)]
*  Some crazy China policy that makes no sense [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3265.0600000000004s)]
*  and that could lead God knows where. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3267.5800000000004s)]
*  The fucking North Koreans could decide [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3269.3s)]
*  to make their move on South Korea, [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3271.2200000000003s)]
*  and we've seen a bunch of reports to that effect. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3273.02s)]
*  Putin could just start fucking around beyond Ukraine. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3275.1000000000004s)]
*  I mean, this is real, people. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3277.38s)]
*  And so I do think we have to realize that as, [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3279.7000000000003s)]
*  things look kind of chaotic now. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3282.6200000000003s)]
*  It's not hard to see the pieces of craziness [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3284.5s)]
*  that could accompany another Trump term. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3287.82s)]
*  Yeah, the world is chaotic no matter who's in charge, [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3289.7400000000002s)]
*  but leadership matters, [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3291.7400000000002s)]
*  and Trump would be a lot worse in this scenario, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3292.82s)]
*  in my opinion. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3295.0600000000004s)]
*  We shall just note that things are pretty rocky [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3296.1s)]
*  for the Chinese economy right now. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3299.3399999999997s)]
*  So there's Evergrande, [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3300.9s)]
*  which is a massive property developer in China. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3302.14s)]
*  They were forced to liquidate [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3304.7s)]
*  after they couldn't restructure [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3305.94s)]
*  their $300 billion in debt. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3307.14s)]
*  In 2018, Evergrande was listed [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3309.62s)]
*  as the most valuable real estate company in the world. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3311.66s)]
*  So a pretty terrible turn of events there. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3314.8199999999997s)]
*  Last year, China recorded its slowest GDP growth in decades [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3317.42s)]
*  in foreign direct investment, dropped by 8%. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3320.42s)]
*  So China still has an $18 trillion economy [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3323.14s)]
*  that accounts for about 18% of global GDP, [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3326.46s)]
*  but it is slowing down, [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3328.82s)]
*  which will have ramifications in China, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3329.94s)]
*  but also globally. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3332.2200000000003s)]
*  So just something to watch long-term there. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3333.2200000000003s)]
*  We're going a little long, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3335.9s)]
*  so a couple stories just to track then. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3336.7400000000002s)]
*  The Washington Post reported [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3339.3s)]
*  that the Pentagon abruptly canceled plans [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3340.94s)]
*  to hold joint military exercises with Sudan, [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3343.5s)]
*  Niger, and Mali, and several other African countries. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3346.0600000000004s)]
*  They had disclosed this plan to Congress, [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3349.1000000000004s)]
*  then I guess decided you shouldn't do [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3350.7400000000002s)]
*  joint military plannings with military coup leaders. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3352.94s)]
*  Is that what happened? [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3355.9s)]
*  Not the best roster there [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3356.7400000000002s)]
*  that you want to be engaged with right now. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3358.46s)]
*  Tough roster. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3360.26s)]
*  Also some bad news out of Kenya, [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3362.26s)]
*  where a court blocked a plan [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3364.1s)]
*  to deploy 1,000 Kenyan police officers to Haiti, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3365.66s)]
*  who would have provided the backbone [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3369.02s)]
*  of a multinational peacekeeping force [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3370.46s)]
*  that is backed by the United Nations. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3372.9s)]
*  We've covered this a bunch on the show. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3374.9s)]
*  About three years ago, [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3376.26s)]
*  the president of Haiti was assassinated since that incident. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3377.1s)]
*  A very bad security situation has gotten steadily worse, [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3380.54s)]
*  and millions of people are struggling to avoid gangs, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3385.14s)]
*  kidnappers, and levels of violence [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3387.46s)]
*  that are frankly normally only found in war zones. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3389.62s)]
*  The Kenyan government is appealing the ruling. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3392.46s)]
*  The US says they will pledge $200 million [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3394.9s)]
*  to support this peacekeeping effort, [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3397.66s)]
*  but I don't know, hopefully something changes [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3399.22s)]
*  and this is overturned, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3401.58s)]
*  because it does seem like Haiti [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3402.42s)]
*  desperately needs some help here. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3403.42s)]
*  They need some help, and Kenya made a lot of sense [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3404.86s)]
*  for a lot of reasons that we talked about. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3407.06s)]
*  I will just say this China story is like, [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3409.38s)]
*  every now and then you actually go deep on these things [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3411.54s)]
*  and you're like, fuck man, this feels 2008-ish. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3414.86s)]
*  But it doesn't collapse, [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3419.1400000000003s)]
*  but this is 25% of the Chinese economy, [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3420.78s)]
*  and there's clearly just not the money there [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3423.58s)]
*  to make this whole. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3426.6600000000003s)]
*  And so it feels to me like at some point, [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3428.58s)]
*  the Chinese government's gonna have to get involved [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3431.42s)]
*  in a big way, in a kind of tarp bailout kind of way, [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3433.5s)]
*  or else maybe this will be a bubble [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3436.38s)]
*  and believe me, that will affect the US economy a lot too. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3439.7s)]
*  And the other thing that struck me, [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3442.78s)]
*  and there are all these Chinese people [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3444.1s)]
*  that literally paid for apartments [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3446.58s)]
*  that aren't getting built [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3448.7s)]
*  because they have no money to build them. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3449.94s)]
*  It was just a Ponzi scheme. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3451.42s)]
*  And so it added to the sense [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3452.2599999999998s)]
*  that there's gotta be some societal pressures in China [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3453.54s)]
*  that we can't really see, [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3457.02s)]
*  because it's not like they can go out and criticize, [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3458.1s)]
*  but if there's millions of people, [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3459.42s)]
*  imagine if you bought your first apartment [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3462.18s)]
*  and then basically it's a Ponzi scheme [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3463.94s)]
*  and you can't get it and you can't get your money back. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3466.2599999999998s)]
*  I'd kind of watch that space. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3469.86s)]
*  I know, there could be an Arab Spring situation [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3472.2599999999998s)]
*  where something random happens, right? [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3474.46s)]
*  In Tunisia, it was like a vendor lit himself on fire [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3476.78s)]
*  and it sparked this massive upheaval. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3479.74s)]
*  And then six months later, everyone's like, [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3481.74s)]
*  how did the intelligence community miss that? [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3483.18s)]
*  I mean, you could imagine similar levels of outrage [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3484.58s)]
*  and frustration about the economy, [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3487.94s)]
*  about totalitarian rule in China. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3489.5s)]
*  I guess the difference is what happens [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3492.14s)]
*  when you marry that sentiment and anger [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3494.7799999999997s)]
*  among a population with total pervasive surveillance [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3498.02s)]
*  and a government that cracks down brutally. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3501.9799999999996s)]
*  Yeah, but to your point, [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3503.7s)]
*  to people who might dismiss that, [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3504.8999999999996s)]
*  remember that happened on zero COVID [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3506.74s)]
*  and the government changed the policy. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3508.7s)]
*  That's true, that's really the part, yeah. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3509.7s)]
*  They must've been seeing something we weren't [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3512.22s)]
*  because of that surveillance and they literally did a 180. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3514.2599999999998s)]
*  So I think you're right. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3517.22s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3518.54s)]
*  This feels like something to watch. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3520.06s)]
*  That was a remarkable kind of under-discussed moment. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3521.62s)]
*  Tell me what it was. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3523.58s)]
*  It was just total 180. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3524.38s)]
*  It was just total 180, [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3525.22s)]
*  which you can do when you're in Dalai Lama. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3526.06s)]
*  Yeah, when you're Xi Jinping. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3526.9s)]
*  Last thing just to watch. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3528.22s)]
*  So pissed off farmers in France have laid siege to Paris. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3529.18s)]
*  On Monday, French farmers, [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3532.94s)]
*  they blocked roads all around Paris [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3534.7799999999997s)]
*  in an effort to choke off access to the city. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3536.5s)]
*  Some of them are burning bales of hay [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3538.58s)]
*  and tires and shit in the road. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3540.66s)]
*  They're parking their tractors to block traffic. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3542.5s)]
*  These guys are pissed about cost of living increases. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3544.94s)]
*  They're pissed about regulations to fight climate change. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3548.42s)]
*  They're pissed about cuts to subsidies for diesel fuel. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3550.86s)]
*  We've seen similar protests in Belgium, Germany, [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3554.1400000000003s)]
*  Poland, Romania, and the Netherlands. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3557.2200000000003s)]
*  I have no idea what to say about it [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3559.54s)]
*  or what's gonna happen. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3561.1400000000003s)]
*  But man, I mean, Macron, he's got a tough challenge here. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3562.94s)]
*  He's got the Olympics coming up this summer. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3566.78s)]
*  So good luck, man. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3568.5s)]
*  I was chuckling just because, Tommy, [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3569.86s)]
*  one of the good things, apart from seeing you every week, [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3571.1800000000003s)]
*  about doing a podcast for a few years, [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3573.82s)]
*  is it's funny, the stories that just keep coming up. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3576.34s)]
*  So we always have some crazy Australian thing, [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3579.3s)]
*  like some naked people taking psychedelics or whatever, [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3581.42s)]
*  animals, but I feel like we've done a version [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3583.86s)]
*  of French people burning shit. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3586.5800000000004s)]
*  Burning all down. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3589.9s)]
*  And so I gotta say, I love that part [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3591.46s)]
*  of the French political culture, [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3594.5400000000004s)]
*  because it's been going on forever [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3596.86s)]
*  since the French Revolution. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3598.34s)]
*  But the serious point is, I think we've gotten enough signals [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3599.86s)]
*  from the European electorate that they're pissed. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3603.78s)]
*  They're pissed about a lot of things, [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3606.3s)]
*  in particular, cost of living. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3607.6200000000003s)]
*  That's the main headline to me, [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3609.82s)]
*  is just this populist discontent is clearly manifest. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3611.1400000000003s)]
*  Oh, you know Marine Le Pen is gonna be on a tractor [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3616.98s)]
*  outside Paris, burning a Macron in effigy somewhere, [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3619.98s)]
*  leading this thing in a couple days. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3623.38s)]
*  You got something to watch. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3624.58s)]
*  Also, if you're a listener, [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3625.42s)]
*  and you know a pissed off French farmer [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3626.42s)]
*  who can speak to us in English, reach out. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3628.5s)]
*  Yeah, I'd love to hear that. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3630.6600000000003s)]
*  Okay, we're gonna take a quick break. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3632.54s)]
*  When you come back, you'll hear my interview [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3633.5s)]
*  with Ali Valles about what's going on in Iran, [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3634.7400000000002s)]
*  Biden's, the options to respond to these proxy groups, [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3639.06s)]
*  what we know about them, what motivates them, [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3641.86s)]
*  how one can deter Iran, if at all. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3643.7799999999997s)]
*  So stick around for that. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3645.62s)]
*  I am so excited to welcome to the show Ali Valles. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3646.66s)]
*  He is the crisis group's Iran project director [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3649.1s)]
*  and senior advisor to the president of the organization. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3651.7s)]
*  Ali, thank you so much for doing the show. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3654.86s)]
*  Great pleasure to be with you. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3656.18s)]
*  So as we speak, the Biden administration [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3657.56s)]
*  is preparing to respond to this drone attack [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3660.42s)]
*  over the weekend on a US base in Jordan [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3663.56s)]
*  that killed three US service members. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3665.2599999999998s)]
*  The White House says that the attack was conducted [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3668.1s)]
*  by an Iranian backed militia group. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3670.7799999999997s)]
*  So before we get into that and what the response options [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3672.8199999999997s)]
*  might or might not be, I wanted to just step back [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3675.7799999999997s)]
*  and try to understand who are these groups [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3677.74s)]
*  that we're talking about, and just understand [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3679.7s)]
*  where they operate, who they are, [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3683.06s)]
*  are they controlled by Iran, [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3685.14s)]
*  or do they just get some support from Iran? [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3686.7799999999997s)]
*  So can you sort of like walk us through [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3688.8199999999997s)]
*  some of the groups we're talking about, [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3690.58s)]
*  whether it's KH, the Houthis, Hezbollah, Hamas, [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3692.08s)]
*  like whatever you think is sort of relevant here. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3695.54s)]
*  Sure, so this is a network that Iran calls [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3697.46s)]
*  the Axis of Resistance. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3700.7400000000002s)]
*  It spans all the way from Yemen to Iraq, [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3703.06s)]
*  to Syria, to Lebanon, and to Palestine. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3707.1s)]
*  And it's comprised of groups that are often [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3711.18s)]
*  Shia militia groups, like Hezbollah in Lebanon, [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3715.98s)]
*  Iraqi militias, or Syria militias, [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3720.98s)]
*  as well as the Houthis in Yemen, [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3724.1s)]
*  who are also an offshoot of Shiaism. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3725.86s)]
*  But it also includes Sunni groups, [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3729.06s)]
*  like the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3731.9s)]
*  It came about in the early 1980s, [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3737.42s)]
*  when Iran was in the midst of war with Iraq, [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3740.98s)]
*  and felt pretty isolated. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3744.98s)]
*  And the trauma of that war pushed Iran [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3748.42s)]
*  to try to figure out a way of protecting itself better [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3752.3s)]
*  with all the shortages that it was feeling. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3756.9s)]
*  Even today, if you look at Iran's situation, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3760.38s)]
*  it's one of the biggest countries [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3764.1200000000003s)]
*  and the most populous countries in that part of the world. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3765.5s)]
*  But from a conventional military perspective, [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3769.0600000000004s)]
*  is weaker than a lot of other adversaries [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3771.6600000000003s)]
*  in states around it. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3774.5s)]
*  The UAE, which is the size of a province of Iran, [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3776.2200000000003s)]
*  small province of Iran, [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3779.98s)]
*  has one of the most advanced air forces in the region [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3782.5800000000004s)]
*  that can take out Iranian Air Force in a matter of hours. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3785.46s)]
*  Iranian Air Force dates back from the time of the Shah, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3788.86s)]
*  is basically a flying museum. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3791.7000000000003s)]
*  And Iran is not a member of any military alliance. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3794.94s)]
*  It doesn't have a security guarantor. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3799.26s)]
*  It's not like Turkey, a member of NATO. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3801.7000000000003s)]
*  It's not like Saudi Arabia, who can count on US support. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3803.6600000000003s)]
*  And so it has tried to make up for this shortcoming, [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3808.04s)]
*  by hiring partners and proxies [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3812.3s)]
*  that can deter an attack on Iranian soil, [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3815.0600000000004s)]
*  that it believes that it cannot protect properly. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3818.5s)]
*  This is the concept of strategic depth, [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3822.1400000000003s)]
*  which the Iranians are pursuing here. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3825.1800000000003s)]
*  And Tommy, they believe that it has worked for them. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3829.1000000000004s)]
*  They believe that the reason Israel or the United States [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3833.34s)]
*  have not attacked their nuclear program [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3836.46s)]
*  in all these years of being in a nuclear standoff, [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3839.78s)]
*  is not because they were afraid of Iran, [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3843.42s)]
*  but it is because they were afraid of hundreds of thousands [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3845.34s)]
*  of Hezbollah missiles targeting [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3850.5s)]
*  civilian population centers in Israel. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3854.3s)]
*  And I remember very well, [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3857.94s)]
*  once the senior Israeli official told me, [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3859.4s)]
*  for us, Iran is a thousand kilometers away. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3862.1800000000003s)]
*  For Iran, Israel is 10 meters away [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3865.5400000000004s)]
*  from across the Lebanese border. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3868.62s)]
*  So that's a concept that they believe [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3870.7s)]
*  has been pretty effective. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3873.0s)]
*  Now, in order to put this network together, [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3874.2799999999997s)]
*  they picked up the Palestinian cause, [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3876.7s)]
*  which was left on the ground by the Arabs in the 1980s, [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3878.48s)]
*  after years of fighting with Israel. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3882.46s)]
*  The Arabs had failed to advance that agenda [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3884.54s)]
*  and had left the cause on the ground. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3887.2999999999997s)]
*  And for Iran was a real opportunity, [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3889.8199999999997s)]
*  because Iran is a sweet, generous nation. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3894.12s)]
*  And so by definition, there is a hard ceiling [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3897.38s)]
*  to its ability to project power in the region [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3900.7000000000003s)]
*  as a Persian nation among Arabs and Turks, [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3903.86s)]
*  or as a Shia nation among Sunnis. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3906.9s)]
*  But the Palestinian cause allowed it [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3910.1400000000003s)]
*  to transcend all of those limitations. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3911.82s)]
*  And that's why there is an ideological facade here. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3915.1800000000003s)]
*  But in practice, it is really a mechanism [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3919.7400000000002s)]
*  to try to deter an attack on Iranian soil. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3923.02s)]
*  Do we know which one of these groups the US [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3925.9s)]
*  thinks is responsible for this drone attack in Jordan, [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3928.7000000000003s)]
*  and how much support Iran has or has not given them? [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3931.42s)]
*  We don't know for sure, because the statement that came out [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3934.42s)]
*  taking responsibility for the attack [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3938.42s)]
*  was from an umbrella group known as the Islamic Resistance, [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3940.98s)]
*  which is comprising some of the Iraqi and Shia militia groups. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3945.06s)]
*  I've seen speculation that this might [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3950.56s)]
*  have been Qatayib Hezbollah or Nojaba. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3953.0s)]
*  Both of them are very close with Iran. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3957.32s)]
*  But one has to understand that Iran [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3960.72s)]
*  doesn't have the same relationship with groups [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3963.4s)]
*  within this network. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3966.16s)]
*  They really fall on a spectrum. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3967.56s)]
*  And at the one end of the spectrum [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3970.2s)]
*  you have Hezbollah, whose relationship with Iran [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3971.7s)]
*  is akin to two NATO allies. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3975.24s)]
*  There is absolute trust between them. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3979.52s)]
*  There is a high degree of coordination, [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3981.96s)]
*  or even delegation of responsibilities. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3983.96s)]
*  And at the other end of the spectrum, [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3987.6s)]
*  you have the Houthis in Yemen. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3989.2000000000003s)]
*  They are fiercely independent, and they actually [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3991.8s)]
*  have a long track record of ignoring Iranian advice. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3995.3s)]
*  And then there are different groups [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=3998.76s)]
*  that fall in between these two different shades of gray. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4000.1800000000003s)]
*  And both Qatayib and Nojaba, who were probably [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4004.4s)]
*  responsible for this attack, are [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4009.44s)]
*  among the groups that are closer to Iran [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4011.8s)]
*  and coordinate quite closely with the Revolutionary Guards. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4014.12s)]
*  The big buzzword you're hearing right now is deterrence. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4019.76s)]
*  You even hear some progressive, some liberals, [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4022.88s)]
*  saying the US has to restore deterrence with Iran. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4025.08s)]
*  And the conventional wisdom in Washington [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4028.2000000000003s)]
*  seems to be that the only way you can deter Iran [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4030.2000000000003s)]
*  is through military force. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4033.28s)]
*  Do you agree with that conventional wisdom? [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4035.12s)]
*  And if not, how do you think the US or some coalition [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4037.56s)]
*  can convince Iran that it's not in their interest [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4041.96s)]
*  to support these groups that are targeting [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4044.56s)]
*  US forces or commercial vessels in the Red Sea? [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4046.88s)]
*  Well, Tommy, I think deterrence is [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4049.68s)]
*  one of the most overused words in Washington, DC, [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4051.24s)]
*  to the extent that it has lost its meaning, really. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4055.12s)]
*  I would argue that we've never had deterrence against Iran. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4058.04s)]
*  When have we successfully managed [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4062.7999999999997s)]
*  to deter Iran from pursuing activities [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4065.4s)]
*  that we consider destabilizing or problematic? [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4067.96s)]
*  When we had 150,000 troops on both sides of Iran's borders [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4071.76s)]
*  in Iraq and Syria, and we had proven to the Iranians [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4075.8s)]
*  that we're willing to take risks, [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4079.76s)]
*  we had just toppled their regime in Afghanistan [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4081.28s)]
*  and the regime in Iraq, the Iranians [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4085.88s)]
*  were quickly expanding their nuclear program, [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4089.0s)]
*  and they were sending IEDs to Iraq to kill Americans. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4092.0s)]
*  When the Trump administration killed General Soleimani [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4096.24s)]
*  in Baghdad in January of 2020, we [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4099.2s)]
*  were told that deterrence was restored. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4101.52s)]
*  Two months later, there was an attack in Iraqi Kurdistan [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4104.4800000000005s)]
*  that killed two Americans and a Brit. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4107.6s)]
*  We've never had deterrence against Iran. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4110.84s)]
*  And at best, what we have been able to do [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4114.32s)]
*  has been to degrade some of their capabilities. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4117.56s)]
*  Yes, General Soleimani's successor [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4120.84s)]
*  is not as effective as he was, but the threat [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4122.92s)]
*  hasn't diminished. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4128.16s)]
*  It has just changed its form. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4129.28s)]
*  The network is still there. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4131.72s)]
*  The coordination among members of this network [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4133.4400000000005s)]
*  today is at a much more advanced level than it was before. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4136.72s)]
*  In terms of their military equipment and capabilities, [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4142.56s)]
*  the network is now at its peak of power. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4146.4800000000005s)]
*  They are taking much more brazen risks [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4150.52s)]
*  than was the case in the past. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4153.84s)]
*  And so at best, what the US has done now [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4156.6s)]
*  through attacks that we've seen the US and the UK [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4160.84s)]
*  has undertaken in Yemen, for instance, [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4163.8s)]
*  has been able to degrade some of the Houthis' capabilities. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4166.360000000001s)]
*  But as we have seen, it has not stopped the attacks [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4170.6s)]
*  that they're conducting on shipping in the Red Sea [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4174.160000000001s)]
*  or in Bab al-Mandab. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4177.320000000001s)]
*  We have also not seen the attacks [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4179.84s)]
*  on Iranian-backed militias in Syria or in Iraq [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4183.0s)]
*  to bring those attacks to an end. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4188.2s)]
*  In fact, they have escalated. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4190.08s)]
*  And now they have, after 165 attacks in which, thankfully, [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4191.72s)]
*  there were no American fatalities, [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4196.360000000001s)]
*  now we have three American service members [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4199.0s)]
*  who have been killed. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4201.400000000001s)]
*  And so I don't think this is a policy that is working. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4202.96s)]
*  And it has been tried and tested multiple times [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4209.12s)]
*  in a bipartisan fashion over many years. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4212.88s)]
*  But I just give you another data point to consider. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4216.72s)]
*  Between March of 2023 and October 7, [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4220.04s)]
*  there were no attacks on US forces in Iraq and Syria. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4224.12s)]
*  Zero. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4228.04s)]
*  Why did that happen? [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4229.28s)]
*  Because Iran and the US were engaged [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4230.76s)]
*  in a mutually beneficial diplomatic negotiations [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4232.92s)]
*  aimed at reaching a de-escalatory understanding [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4237.12s)]
*  that actually worked and delivered [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4239.5599999999995s)]
*  the release of five American hostages [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4242.04s)]
*  and also some of Iran's frozen assets. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4244.599999999999s)]
*  So we know diplomacy works. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4247.2s)]
*  Deterrence doesn't. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4249.64s)]
*  You know, yeah, I mean, I agree with you. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4251.2s)]
*  I sometimes worry that deterrence is just sort of [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4252.5199999999995s)]
*  a nice way of saying revenge in a lot of these, [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4254.96s)]
*  in a lot of contexts. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4257.72s)]
*  But it's interesting. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4258.68s)]
*  I mean, you just, I think, convincingly outlined for us [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4259.5199999999995s)]
*  the way Iran uses these proxy forces [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4262.92s)]
*  as a security blanket, [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4266.32s)]
*  as a way to protect themselves from military attack. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4267.599999999999s)]
*  But we're also seeing a situation now [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4271.04s)]
*  where actions by proxy groups that they back [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4273.0s)]
*  may have led them closer to a direct US military attack [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4277.08s)]
*  than ever before. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4281.5599999999995s)]
*  How should we reconcile those two things? [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4282.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, is it just both sides [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4284.32s)]
*  kind of making strategic mistakes here? [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4285.719999999999s)]
*  Well, it's a perilous game [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4288.32s)]
*  because both sides constantly calculate and calibrate [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4290.28s)]
*  the actions that they're taking, [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4295.679999999999s)]
*  but they are on an escalatory ladder [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4297.32s)]
*  and they're each climbing it [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4300.48s)]
*  in a consistent and continuous manner. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4303.04s)]
*  And at certain points, obviously, [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4306.639999999999s)]
*  they would get in a difficult situation. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4308.4s)]
*  It was predictable and predicted that [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4312.2s)]
*  if the war in Gaza, which is the proximate cause [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4315.28s)]
*  of the tensions that we're seeing in the region [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4318.84s)]
*  continues and gets dragged on, [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4322.32s)]
*  eventually we would end up in this situation. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4324.48s)]
*  Now, I think there are risks of miscalculation on both sides [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4328.839999999999s)]
*  because both the leadership in Tehran and in Washington [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4333.48s)]
*  are aware of the fact that the other side doesn't want war, [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4338.4s)]
*  doesn't want a direct confrontation. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4341.719999999999s)]
*  They are able to manage proxy conflict, [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4344.799999999999s)]
*  but they don't wanna end up in a direct war [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4347.599999999999s)]
*  between Iran and the United States. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4350.919999999999s)]
*  And by the way, the last time [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4353.04s)]
*  we were in a direct military confrontation, it was in 1988. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4354.8s)]
*  So it's been a long time since then. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4360.64s)]
*  And in that episode in an operation called Praying Mantis, [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4363.56s)]
*  the US destroyed half of Iran's Navy in half a day [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4367.84s)]
*  and destroyed some oil facilities offshore in Iran. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4372.04s)]
*  So even that wasn't an attack on Iranian soil, [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4377.24s)]
*  which is what now some members of Congress are asking for. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4379.84s)]
*  But one can easily draw, I think, mistaken conclusions [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4384.6s)]
*  from some of the previous experiences. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4390.92s)]
*  Of course, after the operation Praying Mantis, [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4393.400000000001s)]
*  Iran did not escalate, did not even respond. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4396.64s)]
*  But that was when Iran was exhausted [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4399.96s)]
*  after eight years of war against Iraq. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4402.76s)]
*  It did not have the capabilities it has today. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4405.6s)]
*  It has the biggest and most sophisticated arsenal [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4408.5s)]
*  of ballistic missiles in the region. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4411.18s)]
*  It did not have the network that it has today [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4413.7s)]
*  in terms of partners and proxies around the region. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4416.82s)]
*  At the time, it only had Hezbollah. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4418.9800000000005s)]
*  And Hezbollah was also in its infancy. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4420.9800000000005s)]
*  It didn't have drones and other cyber capabilities [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4423.3s)]
*  that it has today. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4426.9800000000005s)]
*  So the stakes are very different right now. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4428.34s)]
*  There are also people who draw lessons [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4432.18s)]
*  from what we experienced after killing Soleimani. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4433.74s)]
*  You remember there was a barrage of ballistic missiles [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4439.26s)]
*  fired into US bases in Iraq. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4442.219999999999s)]
*  And again, thankfully and miraculously, [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4444.7s)]
*  no one was killed, no American was killed. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4448.0599999999995s)]
*  Trump said there were only a few people who had headaches. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4450.28s)]
*  There were more than 100- [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4455.179999999999s)]
*  Traumatic brain injuries, yeah. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4458.82s)]
*  Exactly, TBIs. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4460.26s)]
*  But overall, that conflict also didn't escalate [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4462.48s)]
*  and it was contained. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4467.639999999999s)]
*  But in 2020, there was a very different government [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4469.5599999999995s)]
*  in place in Iran. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4472.0199999999995s)]
*  There were people who were much more pragmatic, [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4473.48s)]
*  understood the world much better [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4476.48s)]
*  than the current decision makers. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4478.16s)]
*  One thing that worries me is in the past few weeks [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4481.0s)]
*  with in the fog of war and rising tensions, [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4484.639999999999s)]
*  one of the things that Iran did that even for me, [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4487.919999999999s)]
*  who's a nerd who's monitoring everything they've done [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4491.04s)]
*  for years and years, was really shocking [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4493.6s)]
*  was that they fired rockets and drones into Pakistan [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4496.4800000000005s)]
*  a nuclear weapon state. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4501.6s)]
*  Shocking. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4503.12s)]
*  It was really shocking. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4504.28s)]
*  And that tells me that they too are prone [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4505.8s)]
*  to miscalculations. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4508.76s)]
*  And I think this perception that neither side [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4509.92s)]
*  it really has the appetite for war in and of itself [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4512.8s)]
*  can give rise to mistakes and miscalculations. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4516.56s)]
*  Well, this seems to me there's always appetite [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4520.759999999999s)]
*  for war in Washington, D.C. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4522.32s)]
*  But back to some of these proxy forces. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4524.36s)]
*  I mean, to your point earlier, [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4526.04s)]
*  the Houthis clearly are not deterred [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4527.32s)]
*  by these almost daily now US missile strikes [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4530.08s)]
*  or coalition missile strikes into Yemen, [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4533.08s)]
*  which I think started on January 11th. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4534.759999999999s)]
*  But I think last week, there was a Houthi missile fired [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4537.099999999999s)]
*  at a US Navy ship, right? [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4540.5199999999995s)]
*  So the conflict is getting more direct. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4542.099999999999s)]
*  It's not just commercial vessels [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4543.759999999999s)]
*  somehow associated with Israel. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4545.4s)]
*  Many of them were not actually associated with Israel, [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4547.48s)]
*  but that was the proximate cause [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4549.4s)]
*  for what the Houthis were doing, right? [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4550.92s)]
*  They said this was a response [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4552.04s)]
*  to the ongoing war effort in Gaza. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4553.679999999999s)]
*  Some of these Iraq-based militia groups [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4556.48s)]
*  seem to fundamentally just want US forces [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4559.639999999999s)]
*  to get out of Iraq. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4561.879999999999s)]
*  That seems to be their whole reason for existing. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4562.799999999999s)]
*  So I'm just wondering, short of destroying [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4565.339999999999s)]
*  all of the Houthis' weaponry, [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4569.879999999999s)]
*  short of destroying a huge percentage of their fighters, [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4572.0s)]
*  is there any way you think you could actually deter them? [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4576.14s)]
*  Or sort of the flip side of that question is, [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4579.5s)]
*  do you think Iran could force a group like the Houthis [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4582.06s)]
*  or KH to stand down if they wanted to? [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4585.820000000001s)]
*  Or do they not control these groups [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4588.820000000001s)]
*  to that great of an extent? [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4591.54s)]
*  So as I said, there's not a single formula [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4592.9800000000005s)]
*  that applies across the board. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4595.04s)]
*  But with the Houthis, it's actually particularly difficult [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4597.06s)]
*  for the Iranians to be able to have command and control [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4601.14s)]
*  over what they do. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4604.86s)]
*  I tell you an anecdote that I heard [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4606.78s)]
*  from a very senior Iranian official. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4608.599999999999s)]
*  He was involved in negotiations [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4610.94s)]
*  that led to normalization of relations [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4613.58s)]
*  between Iran and Saudi Arabia. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4615.78s)]
*  And he said when he went to Baghdad [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4618.12s)]
*  to start the negotiations with the Saudis, [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4619.86s)]
*  the Houthis significantly escalated their attacks [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4623.38s)]
*  against Saudi Arabia. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4626.139999999999s)]
*  This is in early 2021. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4627.0599999999995s)]
*  Only to remind the Saudis that they are not proxies of Iran [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4629.099999999999s)]
*  and that if Iran wants to deescalate [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4634.18s)]
*  and reconcile with the Saudis, [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4636.42s)]
*  doesn't mean that the Houthis are on the same page. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4637.9800000000005s)]
*  So no, Iranians don't have control over the Houthis. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4642.14s)]
*  Of course, they're complicit in what the Houthis do [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4645.42s)]
*  through financial and military support [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4648.18s)]
*  that they provide to the Houthis. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4650.96s)]
*  And in some ways, I think what the Houthis were doing, [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4653.92s)]
*  which was the most brazen of actions [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4656.96s)]
*  in the aftermath of the Gaza war, [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4661.3s)]
*  among members of the Axis of Resistance, [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4663.780000000001s)]
*  they effectively shot down the free flow of commerce [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4667.14s)]
*  through the Red Sea, affecting the entire global economy. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4672.42s)]
*  In some ways was a double-edged sword. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4678.780000000001s)]
*  The Iranians enjoyed the fact that the Axis [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4680.780000000001s)]
*  is actually delivering on the promise [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4683.820000000001s)]
*  of supporting one another and pushing back [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4686.78s)]
*  against the US and Israel. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4691.259999999999s)]
*  But they were also worried that the Houthis [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4694.38s)]
*  might do something that would put Iran in hot waters. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4697.62s)]
*  And that is, I think, why they sent a spy ship [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4701.139999999999s)]
*  that was helping guide Houthi attacks [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4704.98s)]
*  so that they basically target in a much more cautious way. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4708.42s)]
*  When they saw the writing on the wall [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4714.42s)]
*  that the US was going to retaliate against the Houthis, [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4718.3s)]
*  they withdrew that boat. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4721.68s)]
*  And that's when the Houthis mistakenly targeted [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4723.9400000000005s)]
*  a Russian ship. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4727.34s)]
*  And now that that boat seems to be more closer [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4730.66s)]
*  to the Gulf of Aden, the attacks seems to have shifted [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4734.5s)]
*  in that direction. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4738.22s)]
*  The Iranians are involved in what the Houthis are doing, [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4739.22s)]
*  but they certainly do not have control over them. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4744.42s)]
*  Back to this attack in Jordan. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4749.620000000001s)]
*  So Biden said several times now, we shall respond. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4751.38s)]
*  Now, the range of options seems to be sanctions, [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4755.1s)]
*  some sort of massive military response [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4760.68s)]
*  just on one of these militia groups. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4763.700000000001s)]
*  The next ratchet up would be strikes on IRGC targets [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4766.46s)]
*  in Iraq, Syria, or Yemen. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4769.86s)]
*  And then the most extreme option would be [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4772.38s)]
*  including some sort of target within Iran itself. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4774.7s)]
*  Hopefully they don't get to that. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4777.58s)]
*  I have to expect that unlike 1982, [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4779.54s)]
*  Iran will respond to the response, right? [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4782.7s)]
*  And there will be some incident, [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4785.62s)]
*  whether it's on US forces in the region, [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4787.74s)]
*  whether it's on US ships, the US homeland, [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4789.9s)]
*  or maybe you could imagine Hezbollah [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4792.42s)]
*  launching some massive attack on Israel. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4794.86s)]
*  What do you think that the response [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4797.299999999999s)]
*  to a US response could look like? [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4800.339999999999s)]
*  Like what is the bomb Iran crowd going to get sent back [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4802.219999999999s)]
*  our way if we really go all in on a major attack on Iran? [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4806.42s)]
*  Well, Tommy, I think it's important to remember [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4810.62s)]
*  that every time that there's been a confrontation, [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4813.259999999999s)]
*  the Iranians have responded. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4817.74s)]
*  With the exception of that experience in the 1980s, [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4820.46s)]
*  in recent years, they've always responded. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4824.82s)]
*  So I give you an example. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4826.86s)]
*  When the Trump administration imposed maximum pressure, [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4829.66s)]
*  the Iranians started targeting shipping in the Persian Gulf [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4833.58s)]
*  and targeted ports in the port of Fajr in the UAE. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4837.9s)]
*  They targeted oil infrastructure in Saudi Arabia. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4844.62s)]
*  They shot down a US drone. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4848.66s)]
*  Of course, when the US killed Soleimani, [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4851.0199999999995s)]
*  they counter-struck through firing ballistic missiles. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4852.98s)]
*  So every time, there has been an Iranian response. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4857.34s)]
*  And this time around, if the US targets Iranian assets [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4862.26s)]
*  and not just Iranian-backed militias, [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4867.0199999999995s)]
*  there will be an Iranian response. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4870.5s)]
*  My guess is that it would be quite similar [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4874.38s)]
*  to the summer of 2019, that they might fire rockets, drones, [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4877.22s)]
*  or even mine the Persian Gulf to target shipping. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4886.46s)]
*  This time, I don't think they would target the Arab Gulf [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4891.02s)]
*  states because they have much better relations with them now. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4894.26s)]
*  But that's the kind of counter-strike [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4898.7s)]
*  that I expect from the Iranians. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4902.54s)]
*  It has the dual utility of not just demonstrating [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4905.42s)]
*  that they're responding to the US, [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4909.9400000000005s)]
*  but also, just like what the Houthis have done in the Red Sea, [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4911.78s)]
*  put pressure on the international economy. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4915.38s)]
*  It would certainly jack up oil prices, [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4919.7s)]
*  hurting the president in an election year, and so on. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4922.38s)]
*  But there will certainly be an Iranian response. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4926.66s)]
*  And then if there is a retaliation from the US, [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4928.900000000001s)]
*  then we are continuing to climb up this escalatory ladder [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4933.5s)]
*  with the risk that at a certain point, [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4938.58s)]
*  it can spiral out of control. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4940.22s)]
*  And although the response, I think, is justified, [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4942.78s)]
*  I think we should be honest in the fact [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4946.3s)]
*  that this is not a solution. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4948.3s)]
*  There is no military solution to this crisis. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4950.78s)]
*  Because eventually, neither side can really afford to back off. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4955.66s)]
*  We're in a game of chicken, [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4961.46s)]
*  and neither side can afford to blink first. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4963.1s)]
*  And the irony of it is that it's actually lose-lose for both sides. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4967.26s)]
*  The US and Israel are not getting what they wanted. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4971.38s)]
*  Hamas is not destroyed. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4974.34s)]
*  US intelligence is saying after four months of bombing them, [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4976.06s)]
*  only 20% of their forces have been killed [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4979.86s)]
*  at the cost of 30,000, almost 30,000 civilians. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4983.3s)]
*  And of course, Hamas is still holding upwards of 100 hostages. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4988.78s)]
*  They haven't been released. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4994.259999999999s)]
*  And the US wanted to prevent the expansion of this conflict. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=4996.7s)]
*  But we're already in a regional war. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5001.82s)]
*  It's still at a low simmer. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5003.7s)]
*  But after the US takes action against Iran, [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5004.98s)]
*  it would definitely be in tropier waters. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5008.219999999999s)]
*  And then from the Iranian perspective, too, [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5012.0599999999995s)]
*  their two key objectives in the war in Gaza hasn't happened. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5015.3s)]
*  Israel continues its onslaught. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5020.22s)]
*  And getting the US, evicting the US out of the region, [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5023.34s)]
*  hasn't happened either. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5028.02s)]
*  And in fact, the US now has a bigger military footprint [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5031.02s)]
*  in the region than it did prior to October 7. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5034.3s)]
*  So both sides are losing. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5036.58s)]
*  And instead of addressing the symptoms of what's happening, [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5038.74s)]
*  address the approximate cause of it, which is the war in Gaza, [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5043.1s)]
*  this situation will only go from that to war. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5047.26s)]
*  Yeah, agreed. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5049.58s)]
*  Last question for you. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5051.06s)]
*  Nowhere in the debate over Biden's options [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5052.54s)]
*  is diplomacy mentioned. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5055.54s)]
*  Not even in our conversation have we really [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5057.860000000001s)]
*  talked about a diplomatic offshoot [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5059.620000000001s)]
*  for this current conflict. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5060.900000000001s)]
*  Once upon a time, a few years ago, [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5064.06s)]
*  diplomacy was front and center. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5065.620000000001s)]
*  There was the JCPOA, the Iran Nuclear Agreement that [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5066.9400000000005s)]
*  was negotiated by Obama. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5070.14s)]
*  Trump pulled out of the JCPOA in 2018. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5071.86s)]
*  Looking back, what do you think the impact of that decision [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5075.54s)]
*  was in terms of not just the US-Iran relationship, [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5079.7s)]
*  but how it might have impacted internal Iranian politics? [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5084.38s)]
*  Well, I think it's one of the most disastrous strategic mistakes [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5088.46s)]
*  that the US has committed in the Middle East in years. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5092.46s)]
*  It rendered Iran much more aggressive in the region, [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5097.299999999999s)]
*  much more repressive at home. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5101.5s)]
*  And it basically killed any trust [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5104.82s)]
*  in the reliability of the United States [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5108.82s)]
*  as a negotiating partner, not just in the case of Iranians, [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5111.1s)]
*  but in the future, if there are any negotiations, [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5113.98s)]
*  but other difficult actors like North Koreans or Venezuelans [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5117.18s)]
*  or Russians, we're going to face similar questions, what's [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5121.26s)]
*  going to happen in the next administration. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5124.94s)]
*  And I'm sorry to say, but I think the Biden administration [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5128.3s)]
*  actually made matters worse. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5132.34s)]
*  I refer to the fact that we had a detainee deal in September, [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5135.1s)]
*  as part of which 6 billion of Iranian assets in South Korea [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5140.9400000000005s)]
*  were released for humanitarian trade, which, as you know, [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5145.3s)]
*  is exempt from US sanctions. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5149.42s)]
*  So Iranians should have had access to that money all along. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5151.820000000001s)]
*  But we basically put in a mechanism [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5156.66s)]
*  where the Treasury Department can monitor and veto [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5160.98s)]
*  every single request that the Iranians have [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5165.86s)]
*  to use this money through the Qataris [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5169.0599999999995s)]
*  to buy food and medicine and medical equipment. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5171.3s)]
*  And yet, when October 7 happened, [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5175.099999999999s)]
*  the Biden administration pulled the plug on that understanding. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5177.78s)]
*  Not officially, but it has asked the Qataris [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5183.38s)]
*  not to give access to the Iranians. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5187.14s)]
*  Now, this is not the Trump administration [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5190.5s)]
*  cheating on Obama's deal. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5192.86s)]
*  This is the Biden administration cheating on its own deal, which [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5194.66s)]
*  had nothing to do with Gaza or Hamas or anything else. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5198.54s)]
*  It was a humanitarian deal. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5204.34s)]
*  And I think that is going to have [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5207.38s)]
*  long-term negative consequences for the United States' [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5208.9800000000005s)]
*  ability to deal with adversaries. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5213.06s)]
*  And another impact that it has is that it has now brought Iran, [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5216.5s)]
*  the withdrawal from the JCPOA, has basically [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5220.26s)]
*  taken Iran's nuclear program that was put in a box [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5225.46s)]
*  and under the most rigorous monitoring out there [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5228.9400000000005s)]
*  by the Obama administration. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5231.620000000001s)]
*  The Trump administration put it in a microwave. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5233.700000000001s)]
*  And Iran is now closer than ever to the verge [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5236.9400000000005s)]
*  of nuclear weapons. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5239.820000000001s)]
*  It can now have, in a matter of days, [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5240.86s)]
*  enough enriched uranium for a single nuclear weapon [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5243.42s)]
*  that it can then use to weaponize. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5247.62s)]
*  In a month, it can have an arsenal [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5250.259999999999s)]
*  worth of nuclear material for enriched weapons grade. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5252.38s)]
*  And what I'm particularly worried about [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5258.62s)]
*  in the current situation of regional tensions [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5261.219999999999s)]
*  is that if the US strikes Iran on its soil, which [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5265.299999999999s)]
*  is what the Republicans, who are also advocates of exiting [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5269.86s)]
*  the JCPOA, are asking for. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5274.86s)]
*  In that situation, Tommy, Iranians, I think, [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5277.98s)]
*  will come to the conclusion that the regional deterrence [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5281.74s)]
*  hasn't worked because the US has struck them on their own soil. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5284.5s)]
*  And they will then try to replace [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5289.179999999999s)]
*  the regional deterrence or to complement it [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5291.46s)]
*  with nuclear deterrence, which is the ultimate deterrent. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5294.339999999999s)]
*  Now, they weren't able to do this [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5298.06s)]
*  when they were in the JCPOA. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5300.620000000001s)]
*  It would take them one year to enrich enough uranium [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5302.42s)]
*  for a single nuclear weapon. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5305.54s)]
*  They can now do it in days. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5307.18s)]
*  And that's the achievement of Trump's withdrawal [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5309.34s)]
*  from the JCPOA. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5311.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's truly, truly disastrous. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5313.38s)]
*  I lied. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5315.38s)]
*  Actual final question. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5315.88s)]
*  The Houthis say they are attacking ships [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5318.34s)]
*  because they want the war in Gaza to end. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5320.620000000001s)]
*  Do you think that these Iranian proxy groups will actually [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5323.34s)]
*  stop all these attacks if there is a series [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5326.34s)]
*  of fire or a permanent end to the war? [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5328.860000000001s)]
*  Should we believe them? [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5330.860000000001s)]
*  Or do you worry that the Houthis have realized [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5331.860000000001s)]
*  they have this incredible tool in their arsenal [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5334.46s)]
*  now where they can basically shut down global commerce anytime [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5336.66s)]
*  they want, and they might trot it out again in the future [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5339.9400000000005s)]
*  for another reason? [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5343.1s)]
*  Well, let me put it this way. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5344.22s)]
*  There is no guarantee that they will not [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5345.38s)]
*  use this tool in the future. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5347.9400000000005s)]
*  But there is a guarantee that they [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5351.22s)]
*  will continue to use it as long as the war in Gaza is ongoing. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5352.66s)]
*  And we had this experiment in the one week long ceasefire [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5356.66s)]
*  that most of these attacks by groups affiliated [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5363.42s)]
*  with Axis of Resistance came to a halt during that ceasefire. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5367.38s)]
*  But again, it's not really a question of what they will do, [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5373.26s)]
*  but it's a question of whether the status code is actually [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5377.78s)]
*  making Israel safer or bringing the US closer [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5384.66s)]
*  to its strategic objectives. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5387.5s)]
*  And I think the answer to both of those questions is no. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5389.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, agreed. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5391.82s)]
*  Well, Ali, thank you so much for doing the show. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5392.78s)]
*  I really appreciate you joining us [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5394.74s)]
*  and for all the smart and thoughtful ways [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5397.099999999999s)]
*  you're trying to advance diplomacy all around the world. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5399.0599999999995s)]
*  So thank you. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5401.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5402.0199999999995s)]
*  Great being with you. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5402.46s)]
*  Thanks again to Ali for joining the show. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5403.34s)]
*  Bon chance to the French farmers. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5407.18s)]
*  Thanks to Taytay and the Kelsey family. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5409.58s)]
*  I really want to see Detroit. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5413.82s)]
*  Yeah, like, no offense to the Niners. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5415.74s)]
*  No, but it's just like Detroit would have been [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5419.219999999999s)]
*  so good for that fan base. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5421.219999999999s)]
*  Goofy ass Dan Campbell crying up there. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5422.9s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5424.82s)]
*  I mean, well, not to get, I guess we're at the outro [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5426.5s)]
*  so we can get, like there's some weird Dan Campbell calls though. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5429.94s)]
*  Like, you know, I know sometimes he goes for it and forth down, [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5432.9s)]
*  sometimes he doesn't, but anyway, it's too bad. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5437.42s)]
*  Tough, tough. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5439.78s)]
*  Anyway, talk to you guys next week. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjbxGZUEJso&t=5440.78s)]
