Video Description: Ben Rhodes and Tommy Vietor discuss the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas and how the US and Qatar helped broker it, Qatar’s unique role in international diplomacy, the debate over conditioning US aid to Israel, what we know about the Palestinians being released from Israeli prisons, and Elon Musk’s cynical trip to Israel. Then they cover right-wing populist election victories in the Netherlands and Argentina, reports that the US thwarted an attack on a Sikh separatist on American soil, leaked documents exposing the UAE’s plans to use COP28 to sell more oil and gas, and former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s run-in with a whale. Then Ben talks to Juliette Touma, Communications Director for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, about humanitarian efforts in Gaza and what she witnessed on her recent visit there.

*  Yeah, we absolutely congratulations on that. Well, good just good draft positioning. We may be two [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=36.0s)]

*  We're gonna cover the ceasefire in Gaza the debate over conditioning aid to Israel [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=45.2s)]
*  Cutter do you say Qatar or Qatar? Where do you land? I say Qatar your cutter? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=50.36s)]
*  Okay, so you're like a middle ground your third way [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=55.2s)]
*  Cutters unique role in international diplomacy. It will talk about the Palestinian prisoners being released by Israel as part of the ceasefire deal [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=58.660000000000004s)]
*  And Elon Musk anti-semitism. Yes [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=65.98s)]
*  Surprise visit to go hang out between India. Mm-hmm cover that [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=69.3s)]
*  There's also been big elections in Argentina and in the Netherlands that suck [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=72.94s)]
*  We'll talk about another assassination plot against a sick separatists in the US [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=78.38s)]
*  The latest news about the upcoming cop 28 climate change summit and why the former president of Brazil is in trouble again [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=83.52s)]
*  And he got in trouble this time while on a jet ski, which is an interesting wrinkle for mr [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=90.72s)]
*  Bolsonaro and then then you did our interview earlier today. Who'd you talk to? Yeah, I talked to Juliet Tuma who is the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=95.54s)]
*  communications director for UNRA that's the UN agency that is responsible for [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=101.94s)]
*  supporting [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=106.4s)]
*  refugees in Palestine and Gaza [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=107.84s)]
*  So UNRA for those who don't know they run schools they run some healthcare infrastructure [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=109.66s)]
*  They have huge responsibilities in Gaza [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=115.1s)]
*  Since the beginning of the war over a hundred UNRA employees have been killed Jesus [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=118.58s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of an astonishing number and currently they are running makeshift shelters for over a million [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=125.38s)]
*  displaced Palestinians in Gaza [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=132.62s)]
*  So we talked about you know what UNRA does what she Juliet saw in Gaza [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  She was in Gaza until just the last couple of days [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  What the value and importance of this ceasefire is and just what the human toll is and also what are the challenges looking ahead? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=143.72s)]
*  At helping to support [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=151.76s)]
*  You know over a million displaced people [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=154.36s)]
*  Helping to reconstruct rebuild lives rebuild Gaza [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=157.4s)]
*  So really wanted to get a sense from someone who's been on the ground of the scale of the challenges in Gaza right now [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=161.45999999999998s)]
*  Yeah [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=166.5s)]
*  I mean look we focus on the casualty numbers coming out of Gaza for obvious reasons because they're enormous and horrifying [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=166.73999999999998s)]
*  But the the I've seen statistics that up to 75% of the population has been displaced if not more [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=172.78s)]
*  There are stats about you know 20 30 40 50 percent of the country [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=178.94s)]
*  Being essentially uninhabitable [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=183.7s)]
*  Or the the Gaza Strip that is not the country, but it's really an enormous task ahead of them even when the war yeah [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=186.23999999999998s)]
*  I think this is the least appreciated thing [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=192.76s)]
*  I mean imagine if it goes on to if you write the military campaign moves south and we'll talk about this and there's any [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=194.72s)]
*  Comparable destruction there. I mean you could basically have two million homeless people [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=200.44s)]
*  Who have nowhere to go and how do you support those people? So I mean there's a lot of work ahead here [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=204.32s)]
*  Yeah, this is far from the most important point [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=211.42000000000002s)]
*  But who do we need to talk to at the UN about how they name these things like unra the? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=214.02s)]
*  Unifil like you can go through four years in the White House as I did and not know the names of all these little like ad hoc [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=220.74s)]
*  UN organizations that they throw together. Yeah, this is it's an acronym for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=227.66s)]
*  Palestine refugees in the Near East it's a come on. What are we doing here? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=234.54000000000002s)]
*  What's interesting about it is it was it's dedicated to deal like the Palestinian refugee issue obviously dates all the way back [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=238.60000000000002s)]
*  To the partition in 1948 and so this is this kind of very unique [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=245.16000000000003s)]
*  UN agency that exists for this one purpose and what they mainly do is run schools [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=251.32000000000002s)]
*  I mean, I think that's a big bulk of their personnel [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=256.2s)]
*  but yeah, it's it's [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=259.04s)]
*  It's really I mean, I can't imagine doing that work while you're losing people [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=261.08000000000004s)]
*  Can't imagine well, let's let's turn to Gaza because there was some rare good news out of Gaza last week [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=265.62s)]
*  With a big assist from President Biden and Qatar [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=271.9s)]
*  Israel and Hamas brokered a temporary ceasefire deal the initial deal committed Hamas to returning 50 Israeli hostages [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=276.21999999999997s)]
*  Most mostly elderly women and children in exchange for a four-day ceasefire [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=282.46s)]
*  Israel agreeing to release 150 Palestinian prisoners and a commitment to allow more aid trucks into Gaza [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=287.86s)]
*  That truce held for all four days and then was extended two more days with Hamas [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=293.42s)]
*  Releasing ten more hostages per day in exchange for Israel continuing to release these Palestinian prisoners on Tuesday Barack Ravid [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=298.58s)]
*  Great reporter from Axios tweeted that Israel is willing to extend the ceasefire for up to nine more days [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=306.22s)]
*  If Hamas commits to continuing to release ten additional hostages per day, so that's hopefully good news [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=311.7s)]
*  We also saw that Bill Burns the CIA director is in Qatar [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=317.34000000000003s)]
*  I got there Tuesday for more negotiations with the head of the Mossad Israel version of the CIA [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=321.4s)]
*  And the emir of Qatar about possibly getting more hostages out and extending the ceasefire. So fingers crossed there [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=326.88s)]
*  Of course this temporary ceasefire comes after an estimated 14,000 deaths in Gaza including 10,000 women and children [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=333.11999999999995s)]
*  Again, these numbers come from the Hamas run ministries in Gaza [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=340.4s)]
*  I understand the people are sometimes skeptical about their accuracy, but let's cut those say you cut those numbers in half [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=343.23999999999995s)]
*  We're still talking about just an unimaginable [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=349.26s)]
*  Unprecedented loss of life. So I think it's just worth remembering that [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=352.02s)]
*  We are also starting to see Ben some reports trickling out about how Israeli hostages were treated while in Hamas custody [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=354.86s)]
*  The aunt of a 12 year old boy who was held hostage by Hamas says he was beaten [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=361.98s)]
*  Threatened a gunpoint if he cried and then forced to watch footage of the October 7th massacre [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=366.42s)]
*  So just you know sadism beyond belief [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=372.66s)]
*  The US believes there are still eight or nine American hostages being held in Gaza. We spoke with a woman named Elana Curiel [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=376.24s)]
*  She's an Israeli journalist for Ynet [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=382.88s)]
*  She is a family friend of one of the American hostages who has been released a little girl named Abigail Edan [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=384.96000000000004s)]
*  Elana who you'll hear from in this clip was friends with Abigail's father who tragically was murdered by Hamas [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=392.04s)]
*  And Elana spoke with Abigail's family and sent us this update Amalia and Michael saw their sister yesterday [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=398.04s)]
*  And [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=406.0s)]
*  They were really excited [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=407.40000000000003s)]
*  Abigail one of the first things she asked was about them and [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=412.56s)]
*  She's doing good. She's smiling [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=418.72s)]
*  She asked for pretzels and grape juice physically she's in good condition [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=423.12s)]
*  but [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=430.88s)]
*  like you heard from [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=432.48s)]
*  From multiple reports [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=435.92s)]
*  in the Hamas captivity, they weren't fed well at all [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=438.8s)]
*  The hygiene was [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=446.40000000000003s)]
*  Lacking to say the least [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=450.32s)]
*  But other than that it seems like they weren't injured and [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=453.52s)]
*  They're in general good condition I'd like to say that they're coming home but [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=459.66s)]
*  They don't have a home to [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=467.86s)]
*  come back to they're staying somewhere else with family and [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=470.5s)]
*  they're a little bit more isolated and sheltered over there and they're being taken care of and [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=475.86s)]
*  They're having social workers and [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=484.56s)]
*  Psychologists that are treating them and [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=490.48s)]
*  They're being looked after and loved and that's the most important thing [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=495.52s)]
*  Yeah, so again, this is a four-year-old girl turned four actually in captivity in Hamas captivity [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=499.76s)]
*  Who saw her parents murdered in front of her on October 7th, but luckily is now home [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=504.76s)]
*  So Ben, why don't we we pause there? I mean [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=510.03999999999996s)]
*  What else do you think people should know about how this deal came together and how important do you think the US government was to helping? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=512.8599999999999s)]
*  Facilitate it and get this thing done [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=519.42s)]
*  Well, I mean clearly what happened here is that Qatar has this relationship with Hamas [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=522.42s)]
*  there's Hamas political office based in Qatar with some of the Hamas political leadership there and [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=528.0999999999999s)]
*  Qatar has also been kind of one of the principal external donors supporting kind of basic functions and [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=534.42s)]
*  Gaza over the years and so their diplomacy their offices kind of facilitated a negotiation in which [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=540.68s)]
*  You know, I think the United States [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=549.68s)]
*  Was in some kind of three-dimensional diplomacy here because on the one end of the US is [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=551.9599999999999s)]
*  Negotiating with Qatar to try to get the maximum [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=557.76s)]
*  commitment from Hamas to release hostages [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=561.64s)]
*  And to do so in tranches and to do so in ways that you know can obviously be verified [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=563.66s)]
*  At the same time, I think the US [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=569.9399999999999s)]
*  Was in diplomacy with Israel to try to encourage them and maybe even press them to be open to pausing their military operation [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=572.6999999999999s)]
*  Allowing humanitarian aid in and releasing Palestinian prisoners and and the reason that was necessary is I think the Israeli government [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=581.74s)]
*  Out of the [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=589.28s)]
*  Out of the initial stages after October 7th was clearly committed to going forward with a military operation [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=591.0s)]
*  And didn't want to stop and negotiate anything, right? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=596.24s)]
*  And I think where the US probably played an important role was in assembling the pieces of this deal [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=598.48s)]
*  In part that Israel had to agree to you know, so trying to get Israel to say but look it's worth stopping [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=606.6s)]
*  That's a better way to get hostages out and frankly [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=611.28s)]
*  You may not want to allow [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=614.66s)]
*  Aid in on this scale and to Gaza because Israel had wanted to keep Gaza under siege and certainly may not have wanted to [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=616.66s)]
*  Release Palestinian prisoners, but ultimately that's what's gonna work in getting hostages out and frankly [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=623.1s)]
*  that's necessary to alleviate a humanitarian crisis in Gaza that is [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=629.38s)]
*  Exacerbating and obviously understandably leading to a huge international backlash [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=634.34s)]
*  You know, I think the US probably had to bring a huge international backlash [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=638.74s)]
*  You know, I think the US probably had to bring Netanyahu along into this deal as well [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=641.98s)]
*  So so in an interesting way, yeah, you know, there are these details that you know [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=646.54s)]
*  you you and I have been in stories where you you know, the US talks about the diplomacy and [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=650.36s)]
*  Joe Biden called the Amir Qatar and yelled at I actually think in a weird way that the US probably had to you know Qatar had to [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=658.0s)]
*  deliver Hamas [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=665.96s)]
*  and [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=668.0s)]
*  The US had to press Qatar certainly to achieve the maximum amount of hostage releases in that effort and then [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=669.8s)]
*  Simultaneously the US had to work with the Israelis to say look [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=677.28s)]
*  This is you know stop think this is the better way to try to get these hostages out [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=680.5s)]
*  I also think that frankly the public opinion side of Israel the hostage families were mobilized [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=684.4599999999999s)]
*  Yes, they were definitely delivering a message to Netanyahu including sometimes, you know kind of protests and [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=689.5999999999999s)]
*  Demonstrations outside of his house literally that like hey the military operation [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=695.5s)]
*  You know is not necessarily the thing that's gonna bring our loved ones home. You should be open to other approaches [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=700.0s)]
*  so I think they're kind of a [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=704.98s)]
*  constellation of pieces that had to come together to get this done and you know, clearly the US was an indispensable one of those pieces [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=707.66s)]
*  And then last I think Egypt obviously plays a role simply because they they have their own context in Hamas [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=714.54s)]
*  But they're also along that border [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=719.6s)]
*  So obviously you have to coordinate with Egypt on any provision of assistance into Gaza and also some of the hostages are being released [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=720.84s)]
*  out into Egypt others in Israel, so [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=727.14s)]
*  Multi-dimensional here complicated stuff and the US role was obviously indispensable and you know [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=730.5600000000001s)]
*  So was cutters, you know and that you may not like that Hamas as an officer [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=736.5s)]
*  So I'm not suggesting it's not without some complication but like, you know that you need someone who can you know? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=741.46s)]
*  Pick up the phone and get in the let's talk about this Qatar piece for a minute and you're right [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=747.32s)]
*  I mean, I think you can't give enough credit to the families of these hostages for their activism and probably that was pretty well-trained [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=751.34s)]
*  Muscle at this point for a lot of them who've been out on the streets for weeks and months [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=757.5s)]
*  Protesting Netanyahu's attempts to shred the judiciary [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=761.46s)]
*  But so the the cutters role in this so I bet there's some listeners thinking like hey Tom [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=764.38s)]
*  You did a whole series about why Qatar is terrible in the around the World Cup and that was a specific [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=768.94s)]
*  Conversation about their human rights record their labor practices the way the stadiums were built and the number of deaths [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=774.4s)]
*  but they do play this unique role in [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=781.04s)]
*  International diplomacy and for those who don't know I mean Qatar is this tiny little peninsula in the Persian Gulf [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=784.88s)]
*  It's about the size of Connecticut. They host the [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=790.36s)]
*  biggest US military base in the region [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=794.04s)]
*  they're very wealthy thanks to natural gas reserves and [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=796.04s)]
*  Their leaders like to both play this mediating role in international conflicts [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=799.18s)]
*  But they also really like to piss off their neighbors, especially the Saudis [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=803.8s)]
*  Who the Saudis accused them of supporting Islamist groups? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=807.34s)]
*  The cutter also has a ton of gained a ton of influence by launching Al Jazeera [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=810.34s)]
*  Which has a ton of influence in the Arab world? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=814.9399999999999s)]
*  And so, you know to your point then, you know Hamas has had this office in cutter since 2012 before that [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=817.22s)]
*  They were based in Syria [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=824.26s)]
*  But then I think Assad threw them out during the Arab Spring once Hamas started supporting the Syrian opposition [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=825.42s)]
*  Yeah, so they kind of shopped around. I think the US probably helped facilitate this move to to Qatar [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=831.24s)]
*  The US also I think helped facilitate the Taliban opening a political office and Qatar in 2013 [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=837.36s)]
*  And I like you said before I mean some people are probably listening thinking. Okay, how are we cool with? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=843.68s)]
*  Qatar hosting both a gigantic US military base and multiple [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=849.0s)]
*  In the same country and the answer is for moments like this and diplomacy is messy and complicated and but like you need someone to talk to [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=855.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean you know they've had this very intricate policy that the the previous Amir really developed right which is we're tiny and [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=862.12s)]
*  So what's our insurance policy to survive and our insurance policy is one a giant US military base? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=870.16s)]
*  11,000 yes to the most watched and influential television channel in the Arab world [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=877.0799999999999s)]
*  Three [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=883.18s)]
*  we're gonna try to get along with everybody including a lot of Islamist and they do support Islamist and [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=884.18s)]
*  Sometimes that support can be quite problematic in Syria that you know, they supported different groups than you know, just the Free Syrian Army and [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=889.7399999999999s)]
*  But the reality I think this is a moment to stop and think [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=899.06s)]
*  about what diplomacy is and I really want to make this point because [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=904.42s)]
*  Something has happened and maybe it's always somewhat been like this [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=910.22s)]
*  but it's particularly happened over the course of my 20 years in politics where [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=913.32s)]
*  It's become that like diplomacy is something we you know, you should only engage in with like the Brits. You're your friends [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=917.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's not who you make peace with [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=924.1600000000001s)]
*  You know, I think I think it's it's a Caribbean, but there was a famous Israeli way [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=926.4s)]
*  You don't make peace with your friends you make with your enemies. Right? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=930.76s)]
*  You talk to adversaries that's what diplomacy is and so if you don't have lines of communication [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=933.3s)]
*  Into even the worst people in the world, you know, then then what is left other than endless war? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=940.78s)]
*  I mean this is a reminder that you have to engage in [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=946.98s)]
*  difficult and [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=952.8199999999999s)]
*  complicated compromises in order to do things like get hostages out in order to stop wars and [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=954.58s)]
*  In a weird way [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=961.4000000000001s)]
*  What I'd like to take away from this is how necessary it is to do more of this kind of diplomacy [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=963.6800000000001s)]
*  You know, I mean this is otherwise we find if you tell me like we shouldn't possibly do that fine [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=968.26s)]
*  then we can all fight each other for the rest of time, you know, like we give wars and [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=973.5600000000001s)]
*  And and have total moral clarity [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=977.8000000000001s)]
*  that leads to [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=980.44s)]
*  maximalist positions that leads to no reconciliation of any differences, you know, and I [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=982.24s)]
*  So I do think it's we have to remind ourselves [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=987.2800000000001s)]
*  That diplomacy is the most important kind of diplomacy is most often with your most difficult that of a Cuban missile crisis [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=990.1s)]
*  I'm glad that we could get on the phone with [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=998.16s)]
*  Khrushchev and and not a nuclear war like this. This is something that we have to get back to doing more of yeah [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1000.9s)]
*  And you and I were talking this morning [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1006.3s)]
*  I mean obviously Tony Blinken the Secretary of State is doing [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1007.42s)]
*  unbelievable amounts of work traveling all around the globe meeting with everyone who will talk to him to try to sort of [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1010.6999999999999s)]
*  You know cool things off and broker some sort of deal in the Middle East [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1015.4599999999999s)]
*  But you're also seeing Bill Burns the CIA director who was a lifetime diplomat [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1018.68s)]
*  Doing all this shuttle diplomacy, you know pop it up in places like Doha to try to negotiate a deal and you know [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1025.12s)]
*  My hope is that going forward someone like Bill Burns could be the model for a CIA director or some sort of like national security [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1031.76s)]
*  Leadership, it doesn't always have to be some retired four-star general. That's got a lot of experience killing people [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1039.52s)]
*  But not a lot of experience leading talks or brokering diplomatic deals and it's really I think [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1046.18s)]
*  Exciting it's not necessarily new like a lot of times the heads of intelligence agencies play this sort of quiet diplomatic role [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1052.3600000000001s)]
*  But I think Bill is uniquely [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1059.04s)]
*  Well positioned to do this job currently and is you know [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1061.3200000000002s)]
*  His impact is probably showing up well beyond the intelligence his agency collects [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1065.16s)]
*  Yeah, and there's a couple pieces to this [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1069.4s)]
*  I mean one is that the Israeli foreign minister is not like a player in that government [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1071.2s)]
*  Like, you know, Ellie Cohen is that not exactly like a household name [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1076.72s)]
*  It's not Netanyahu's guy, right? And so whereas the Mossad guy is actually more powerful in the Israeli system [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1081.24s)]
*  Probably I'd say than the foreign minister and so sometimes like the counterparts don't match up right like so [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1088.68s)]
*  Bill Burns, you know [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1095.3600000000001s)]
*  Sometimes these kinds of sensitive negotiations particularly in places like the Middle East where the intelligence services can be quite powerful [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1096.76s)]
*  Yeah, if not more powerful [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1102.24s)]
*  You kind of need other channels and in other cases to like discretion allows for other people to do things [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1104.08s)]
*  I mean look I negotiated one prisoner exchange myself when I was in government with the Cubans and [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1110.62s)]
*  The State Department like John Kerry literally could not have done that because it needed to be secret and to be quiet [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1115.62s)]
*  It wasn't with the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It was with kind of their version of the NSC [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1122.62s)]
*  I could fly with no fanfare to like a nondescript location in Canada to meet some people [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1126.98s)]
*  Tony Blinken can't do that. Kerry's got a press plane. Yeah [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1133.54s)]
*  Yeah, Tony Blinken's, you know [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1135.94s)]
*  Like you can't slip off in the middle night and pop up somewhere for a couple days [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1137.74s)]
*  Bill could do that. You see I director can do that, especially when you're Bill Burns, right? Yeah, you just got a sweet stash [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1141.7s)]
*  So it is the case that sometimes you have to kind of find different interlocutors and kind of creative approaches here [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1148.94s)]
*  And and that's clearly what's happened in this case [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1154.18s)]
*  Speaking of intelligence before we move on to some of the more the US pieces [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1156.54s)]
*  It's worth mentioning that there continues to be a ton of reporting on intelligence failures that led up to the October 7th attacks [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1159.54s)]
*  We've talked about how Israeli intelligence was warning Netanyahu that [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1166.3000000000002s)]
*  Israel's adversaries saw it as weakened because of the judicial coup efforts [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1170.8200000000002s)]
*  But then over the break Channel 12 and Israel reported that Israel's military intelligence unit sent detailed warnings up the chain [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1175.54s)]
*  About Hamas actively training for this attack and you know [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1183.34s)]
*  The person who got that warning shot it down saying this is a fantasy essentially the BBC said they reviewed Hamas [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1187.62s)]
*  propaganda videos and in those propaganda videos they saw [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1194.8799999999999s)]
*  Four such training exercises in 14 different locations that included five militant groups that eventually participated in the attacks [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1199.86s)]
*  I just mentioned this to say like a lot of this was happening out in the open some of the [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1208.06s)]
*  Intelligence and military establishment did try to warn political leaders [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1213.46s)]
*  But as we mentioned before Netanyahu still has not taken responsibility for for what happened that day [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1217.3s)]
*  Yeah, and here's a reason why that's really important. That's beyond goes beyond just looking back [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1223.94s)]
*  This is one of the reasons why I support a ceasefire, okay [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1231.3s)]
*  Some people will say how can you support a ceasefire? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1235.4199999999998s)]
*  It's asking Israel to go back to October 6, you know, it's asking them to go back to the kind of the vulnerable position [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1238.22s)]
*  They were in I don't think that's true on [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1244.02s)]
*  October 6 their guard was down on October 6. They had the IDF up in the West Bank [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1246.46s)]
*  Protecting settlers who were in clashes with Palestinians often initiating clashes with Palestinians [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1253.54s)]
*  You had Netanyahu ignoring warnings because he was more focused on his own [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1259.26s)]
*  Political standing with all these protests if this ceasefire continued indefinitely [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1263.82s)]
*  That's not gonna be the case. There's going to be the IDF along that border [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1269.42s)]
*  They're gonna be watching everything if Hamas pops up, they're gonna take a shot at them [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1273.42s)]
*  Nobody's saying that they can't take a shot at Hamas ever again. We're just saying I'm saying that is [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1277.34s)]
*  October 7th literally could not happen again right now, you know because [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1283.38s)]
*  On October 7th, you didn't have that border fortified you didn't have eyes on Hamas like the way it should have been [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1288.06s)]
*  So I think that's an important piece of context. I mean one is how much there should be accountability for Netanyahu [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1294.5s)]
*  Totally falling asleep on the job here. This is political and military intelligence and military leaders have taken responsibility [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1301.6200000000001s)]
*  Yes, even though some of them were warning and even they and they were warning publicly too [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1307.94s)]
*  By the way, they were warning that the the the judicial coup was going to create open opening to this kind of stuff [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1312.14s)]
*  So part of this is accountability and frankly Israel needs a new prime minister. I mean that like the [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1317.9s)]
*  There's something really [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1322.98s)]
*  unpleasant and potentially dangerous about [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1325.26s)]
*  Someone being prime minister who's lost political support who has every incentive to not end a war because [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1328.02s)]
*  The moment it's over like everybody recognizes there needs to be a new leader. But again, it's also this point that [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1335.86s)]
*  Israel is more secure today right now than they were on October 6th because they're not going to [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1342.7s)]
*  Repeat the mistake of loving that border unguarded and and I think that that has to enter into the conversation here because people [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1349.26s)]
*  Understandably like how can you ask them to go back to that? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1355.86s)]
*  There's a separate question about how do you how do you get rid of the military wing of Hamas? [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1357.66s)]
*  That's a totally separate and invalid question as well. But on this question of protecting Israel, I [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1361.46s)]
*  think Israel can [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1367.62s)]
*  Be confident that they're not going to return to the kind of asleep at the switch position that Netanyahu was in on October 6 [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1369.78s)]
*  Yeah, and so part of that [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1375.6399999999999s)]
*  You know sort of getting that defensive posture, right? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1377.7399999999998s)]
*  involves more military funding [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1380.3799999999999s)]
*  So President Biden is working to get Congress to pass more than 14 billion in supplemental defense funding for Israel [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1382.5s)]
*  That money's been held up by Republicans in the House of Representatives [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1388.28s)]
*  They don't like Biden's plan to bundle the money for Israel with money for Ukraine Taiwan and the border and some other stuff [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1391.58s)]
*  In the house, they've been demanding spending cuts to pay for the Israel money and that's sort of a non-starter [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1399.66s)]
*  So there there's a growing debate in the Democratic caucus about whether the US should put conditions on funding for Israel [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1404.02s)]
*  Biden seemed to suggest he was open to the idea last week during a press conference when he called it a quote worthwhile thought [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1412.6200000000001s)]
*  But then you know Ben [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1419.02s)]
*  I saw Jake Sullivan our friend national security adviser to Joe Biden was asked about Biden's comments during an interview with meet the press [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1420.26s)]
*  Here's a clip Jake just to be very clear [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1426.8999999999999s)]
*  Should we take his words that it would be a worthwhile thought to mean that the president is open to signing? [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1429.3s)]
*  Legislation that would provide aid to Israel that comes with conditions. I [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1437.1399999999999s)]
*  Thought the president really couldn't have been clearer when he answered the question [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1444.62s)]
*  He acknowledged the idea and then he said [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1447.44s)]
*  But the way that I have conducted our diplomacy [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1450.46s)]
*  Is that a yes Jake? Is he open to it? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1453.46s)]
*  That's what he's done so far and that's what he's going to do. Is he open to it? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1455.46s)]
*  Again, he is going to continue to focus on what is going to generate results [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1459.26s)]
*  And as he said in the press conference quite clearly and as you can see from the fact that for the last two days [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1464.1000000000001s)]
*  We've seen hostages released the approach that he is taking [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1469.5s)]
*  direct [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1473.5s)]
*  Presidential diplomacy behind closed doors with the Israelis and with our Arab partners [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1474.66s)]
*  That's what's generating the kinds of results that we're seeing right now. That's the course that he's on [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1479.94s)]
*  So there's actually two of the three times Kristen asked that question [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1484.1000000000001s)]
*  It seems pretty clear to me there been that Jake was I think shutting down the idea of conditioning aid at least from the White House's [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1487.06s)]
*  Perspective I tell me if you disagree [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1492.66s)]
*  But are you seeing are you seeing Democrats come to any kind of agreement about what? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1494.3s)]
*  Conditions might be appropriate setting aside the fact that it will never pass the Republican House [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1499.5800000000002s)]
*  But like is there any consensus growing for first of all in a sense with great, you know [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1503.8s)]
*  Understanding it having been there myself and you too [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1509.54s)]
*  Whenever you have to say the president couldn't have been clear the president [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1512.8999999999999s)]
*  Yes or no again, yeah, I think he was clear yeah [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1519.94s)]
*  look [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1523.46s)]
*  There's my read on it. By the way, I've talked to some other folks. There is that Biden was acknowledging. It's an idea out there [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1524.58s)]
*  He was trying to be respectful of it [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1530.58s)]
*  But saying the way I think we should proceed is through this high-level quiet diplomacy with NetYahoo [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1531.8999999999999s)]
*  And that's what I'm gonna keep doing. I think there's a few questions here [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1536.9s)]
*  The first is just the threshold question of does it make sense for the US to provide say 15 billion dollars in military assistance [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1540.42s)]
*  Israel in the current context. Let's say Israel resumes a military operation of the scale [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1546.6200000000001s)]
*  That they were carrying out before [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1552.9s)]
*  this latest pause because we should be clear about [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1555.3400000000001s)]
*  What's happened in Gaza the New York Times report was quite powerful in? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1558.98s)]
*  Essentially and I know you guys talked about this on PSA [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1563.6200000000001s)]
*  But it just bears repeating more women and children been killed in Gaza in two months and in two years in Ukraine [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1565.74s)]
*  Yeah, and think about how we talk about the Russian targeting in Ukraine [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1572.5800000000002s)]
*  If that resumes and the US provides 15 billion dollars in unconditional military assistance of that kind of military operation [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1577.22s)]
*  Given the nature of international public opinion [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1585.18s)]
*  We better stop and think about that I mean wow that that is that is not that's not like a [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1588.92s)]
*  Small thing to do, you know [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1595.24s)]
*  So let's start with that then the question is okay. If you were to condition aid, what would be the conditions? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1597.3600000000001s)]
*  I think there's there's two or three different ideas that I've heard from Democrats in Congress [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1603.18s)]
*  One is and you saw Chris Murphy and you pointed this out to me Tommy like essentially conditioning around [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1609.16s)]
*  War crimes it were basically following you know, if Israel's to follow the laws of war or else, you know the there will be [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1614.36s)]
*  withholding of assistance [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1623.36s)]
*  Obviously that that makes a lot of sense that does require the US then to start making those determinations [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1625.9199999999998s)]
*  Which they are both to do which every time you've seen a US official ask they say well, we're not gonna be the judge [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1631.76s)]
*  Well, I want to say this with a great deal of sensitivity because I don't think it's a one-to-one comparison [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1638.24s)]
*  But the US has been willing to make let's just say the US has been willing to make these determinations about other countries. Absolutely [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1642.44s)]
*  So we should just acknowledge that [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1648.3200000000002s)]
*  And so I think it is worthwhile to do that, but I then think you would need a mechanism [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1650.92s)]
*  Basically what Congress would have to do is require and the Congress does this all the time the reporting requirements and there's precedent for this the lehi [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1656.76s)]
*  There's a lehi law that has governed a lot of military financing to foreign militaries for a long time [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1664.0s)]
*  You you have to basically report to Congress that their human rights violations of them would trigger conditionality [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1669.1s)]
*  So I think there is a precedent for saying hey the administration may be required to report every X number of days whether we think [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1673.9s)]
*  Israel is complying with the laws of war and if not, we turn this off [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1680.3s)]
*  That's one kind of conditionality that would make sense to me [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1683.98s)]
*  It would raise a lot of complexity because the US does find that there are war crimes that could trigger international investigations [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1687.3s)]
*  So that's complicated [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1693.02s)]
*  But you know obviously worth considering because if the US says Israel must follow the laws of war and then opens up the spigot [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1693.82s)]
*  To billions of dollars in military assistance. I think we have to hold them accountable to that [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1699.58s)]
*  then the second piece is interesting and this is something that Bernie Sanders has proposed which is [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1703.46s)]
*  There's this difference between the US and the current Israeli government about the long-term future of Gaza [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1708.1799999999998s)]
*  Is the goal here a Palestinian state? [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1713.46s)]
*  Does Israel reoccupy the Gaza Strip or do they allow for Palestinian or some form of Arab? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1716.34s)]
*  governance to take hold [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1721.74s)]
*  essentially, there's a conditionality that the military assistance is [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1724.22s)]
*  dependent on the Israeli government embracing a Palestinian state or saying that they will transition to [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1728.4199999999998s)]
*  Palestinian or some multinational Arab administration of Gaza [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1735.6599999999999s)]
*  That to me makes a lot of sense [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1739.5s)]
*  yeah, because to me actually the the biggest policy gap that I see right now is and [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1740.9399999999998s)]
*  BB Netanyahu does not support a Palestinian state full stop [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1745.74s)]
*  Well if the goal of the US government as continually articulated by Joe Biden Tony blink and everybody else is this has to end in a two-state solution [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1748.82s)]
*  You need some leverage to to get there. Let me just double stamp that according to some reports out today in Israeli media [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1756.7s)]
*  Netanyahu recently met with a bunch of backbench members of his political party the like who party in a desperate attempt to sort of [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1764.34s)]
*  Hold on to power and he told them quote [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1770.34s)]
*  I am the only one who will prevent a Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank after the war [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1772.82s)]
*  Netanyahu also reportedly said that Biden didn't want Israel to launch a ground invasion into Gaza or enter the Al-Shifa Hospital [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1778.28s)]
*  But he bragged about ignoring the US in both instances [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1784.46s)]
*  So again, this is like the latest instance like you were saying earlier of Netanyahu [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1787.8799999999999s)]
*  scrambling to stay in power and in the process making promises that will prevent any kind of meaningful peace talks and [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1792.04s)]
*  Likely doom everyone involved for repeat this cycle of violence [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1799.36s)]
*  And this is what Netanyahu does and he's done it for like a decade [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1802.84s)]
*  He looks over his right shoulder and he looks at the Ben Gevers and all these lunatics [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1807.8s)]
*  I mean extremists people want to displace all Palestinians and they want to build settlements everywhere [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1812.56s)]
*  And he says to them look I'm the guy I agree with you [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1819.1599999999999s)]
*  But I'm the only guy that can you know? [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1823.6799999999998s)]
*  Appeal to the Americans and I know how to go on American television and I know to like avoid, you know, you know [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1826.08s)]
*  Tough questions and I've friends in Congress. He bragged about this recently a clip surfaced of him a decade ago bragging about exactly this [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1831.6s)]
*  I'm telling you this I 100% this is not in my opinion. This is a fact. I want to this is what he says [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1837.36s)]
*  He says essentially like hey, I'm I'm the only front man for the Israeli right that can keep the Americans in line [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1843.28s)]
*  You know, I mean, that's literally his argument and he might not be wrong [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1850.28s)]
*  He's been right, you know, like and and and that's why again [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1853.44s)]
*  You've heard me say I don't this approach to you like hug him in public and you're tough and private [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1857.8s)]
*  That doesn't work if he's bragging that he ignores you and and basically will never allow a Palestinian state [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1862.6s)]
*  This is who this guy is right and unless the US is willing to draw a line and say [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1868.3999999999999s)]
*  No, you're cut off if you don't change your position [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1874.56s)]
*  By the way, it's not at all unreasonable [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1877.8s)]
*  We impose conditions on on everybody we give assistance to why is there this exception where it's like, you know [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1880.36s)]
*  This leader doesn't share our values. He was trying to undermine his really democracy at home [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1885.68s)]
*  You know, he doesn't want a Palestinian state, but he can get whatever he wants [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1890.2s)]
*  Nothing about BB Netanyahu and we have a long track record [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1895.2s)]
*  Suggests that that he's gonna somehow change and be like, okay now I'll embrace the Palestinian state [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1898.64s)]
*  You know, no like you have to have some conditions here [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1904.02s)]
*  So I think this is a really good idea to say we need to you know [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1906.52s)]
*  Israel needs to support a Palestinian state and they need to support a different [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1910.6000000000001s)]
*  administration of Gaza than an [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1915.96s)]
*  Reoccupation as part of getting this assistance that to me makes a lot of sense [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1917.68s)]
*  the only other one I was gonna raise is settler violence because settler violence is a huge issue in the West Bank and [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1921.24s)]
*  you know [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1926.3s)]
*  There are these settler militias too that literally like arm themselves and go out and and and the US government's been pretty forward-leaning [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1927.44s)]
*  Its statements about this [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1933.5600000000002s)]
*  But I do think it's worth saying that if it turns out that any US assistance finds its way [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1934.68s)]
*  Into this kind of settler activity in the West Bank that's cut off. Yeah. Yeah, you know else had an interesting proposal was [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1939.1200000000001s)]
*  Congresswoman Betty McCollum from Minnesota basically has wants a condition aid saying it can't be used to detain [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1945.28s)]
*  Palestinian kids which again seems awfully reasonable [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1950.8799999999999s)]
*  Then I think that gets us to another piece of context of this deal that people are wondering about which is [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1954.6399999999999s)]
*  Understanding who is being released from Israeli prisons, which Palestinians are being released [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1960.04s)]
*  So the intercept and Vox both have done some great reporting on this which we'll draw from here [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1965.8999999999999s)]
*  So the Israelis put forward 300 names of Palestinians for potential release so of that 300 [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1970.1799999999998s)]
*  233 of them have not been convicted of any crimes [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1977.3s)]
*  124 of them are under the age of 18 [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1980.54s)]
*  There are certainly some like bad people who are you know convicted of attempted murder and other things [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1983.32s)]
*  But you know more broadly [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1988.9199999999998s)]
*  I mean a lot of these folks have not been convicted of any crimes and there's also this broader policy that's [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1990.7s)]
*  Surfacing as part of this conversation of administrative detention where the Israeli government jails Palestinian prisoners [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=1998.06s)]
*  indefinitely without charges and those who end up getting charged don't end up in front of a civilian court they go for a military [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2004.86s)]
*  Tribunal where the conviction rate is nearly a hundred percent [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2010.26s)]
*  There's also this weird [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2014.1s)]
*  Piece of this that's happening it tomorrow Ben Gavir who you mentioned earlier the ultra right-wing national security minister has reportedly told Israeli police [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2016.54s)]
*  That they need to shut down any celebrations of the release of Palestinian prisoners like at their homes [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2024.5s)]
*  So the direct quote from him was my instructions are clear there to be no expressions of joy [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2030.5800000000002s)]
*  Expressions of joy are equivalent to backing terrorism victory celebrations give backing to those human scum for those Nazis [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2036.1000000000001s)]
*  So like that, you know, that's just sort of more agitprop from a guy who's known for it. Like you could understand [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2042.5400000000002s)]
*  Not wanting some sort of massive celebration upon the release of [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2049.42s)]
*  Palestinian and Israeli prison who had murdered someone right that I get that but again what we're talking about here is often [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2055.9s)]
*  Minors kids under the age of 18 who are detained for you know, things like throwing rocks at soldiers getting released [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2064.14s)]
*  and [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2072.46s)]
*  But a lot of the reporting suggests that you know Israel is being forced to release [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2073.82s)]
*  300 terrorists or people all convicted of crimes [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2079.02s)]
*  But the reality is just a lot more murky the reality is murky and in a war that a lot of people seem to be consuming on [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2082.28s)]
*  Social media on Instagram and tick-tock [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2089.3s)]
*  You know, this gets over some blood, but I think you summarized it well the the [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2091.9s)]
*  And I can't judge all these charges. No, if you if you even just take the Israeli charges at face value, right? [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2096.1400000000003s)]
*  Israel has administrative tension but part of what happens here is it like and again if you take the charges at face value [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2103.46s)]
*  There are some people on this list, you know who are charged with very serious things. I'm trying to stab Israeli soldiers, right? [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2109.18s)]
*  But even on the Israeli list [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2116.46s)]
*  Clearly what happens in some cases is there's something that happens in the West Bank [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2120.02s)]
*  there's a clash between settlers and [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2123.18s)]
*  Palestinians or there's a demonstration and a lot of people come out [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2126.62s)]
*  There's kids throwing rocks and Israel just rolls up a lot of them up [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2130.4199999999996s)]
*  You know and throws them in prison and kind of sorts it out later [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2135.4599999999996s)]
*  That's kind of what administrative tension is [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2138.74s)]
*  So even by the Israeli accounting of these people like a lot of these people like dozens of them are like kids like you're just [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2140.3399999999997s)]
*  through rocks in a protest [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2146.4599999999996s)]
*  Doesn't seem like those kids need to be like sitting in prison [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2149.4599999999996s)]
*  Also certainly doesn't seem like they're hardened terrorists or members of Hamas or anything [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2152.62s)]
*  And so in the past frankly there have been different prisoner exchanges where Israel did release hardened terrorists members of Hamas [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2156.84s)]
*  Including the current battlefield leader of a mosque including the guy who planned this attack, right? [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2164.36s)]
*  So in the thousand Palestinians released for Gilad Shalit when it's really soldier that includes this is different [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2168.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean even by the the worst accounting of the people being released [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2173.96s)]
*  None of them are like terrorists leaders. None of them are Hamas leaders [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2178.76s)]
*  You know [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2182.8399999999997s)]
*  They're women and children and a lot of these people clearly [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2184.08s)]
*  Are kind of people that were in the wrong place at the wrong time or people who did things like throw rocks [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2187.9599999999996s)]
*  And and so I don't think there needs to be a sense that these are somehow that somehow Israel's being forced to release [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2192.68s)]
*  You know terrorists they're they're releasing people that were in administrative tension. Most of them were not even chartered. They yeah [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2199.9599999999996s)]
*  so [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2206.64s)]
*  Trying to think if there's a follow on that I should do [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2207.9199999999996s)]
*  It's even worth it and and the one look it's fair to if I'm Israel [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2210.68s)]
*  I don't want to release Hamas fighters, but that's that's not who they're releasing and that's not who the US is asking them to release [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2215.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I think the takeaway here is it's it's murky. It's murky and it does seem like the administrative detentions have ramped up drastically since the [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2220.4s)]
*  October 7th Hamas attack. Yeah, and so it's getting there. They're casting a wider net. They're rolling up more people [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2228.24s)]
*  it's a good point that you make about murkiness is like [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2234.72s)]
*  People can seem to find the facts that support their view of this, right? [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2237.38s)]
*  So it's like some people want to say that they're releasing the worst possible people so they find the worst person on the list [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2241.26s)]
*  And that's the attempted murder thing and say see they're releasing all these murderers, you know [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2246.1s)]
*  And then other people want to say these Palestinians are totally innocent. So they find the most innocent, you know kid that we [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2249.46s)]
*  It's murky or suggesting that by talking about them together. You're drawing an equivalence between [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2255.58s)]
*  Palestinians being released from Israeli prisons and hostages who are taken by Hamas [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2261.7400000000002s)]
*  No one's drawing an equivalence there. They're just part of the same deal [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2266.62s)]
*  Yeah, I mean you're being released in concert and it gets to what we're saying with diplomacy diplomacy is is complicated. Yeah, it's really messy [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2269.98s)]
*  Speaking of messy so Ben about a week ago [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2276.58s)]
*  Some random Twitter user posted an anti-semitic diatribe as one does on Twitter these days where he said he didn't quote [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2280.06s)]
*  Give the tiniest shit that Jews were dealing with increasing anti-semitism [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2288.22s)]
*  Because those same Jews had been pushing quote hatred against whites end quote and somehow enabled quote hordes of minorities to flood into the country [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2292.7s)]
*  To that post Elon Musk replied you have said the actual truth [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2301.5s)]
*  That was Elon boosting and explicitly endorsing the great replacement theory, which basically says liberals Jews [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2306.58s)]
*  You know people like you and me want to bring minorities into the country because the Democratic Party wants more voters and we want to replace [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2313.3s)]
*  All the white people out there [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2320.1800000000003s)]
*  That theory inspired the tree of life massacre [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2322.5s)]
*  Which is the deadliest attack ever on Jews in the United States five years ago [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2325.46s)]
*  And that tweet is far from Elon's only or first dalliance with anti-semitism [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2329.6600000000003s)]
*  He loves to spread conspiracy theories about George Soros, for example [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2334.78s)]
*  So that context is why it was notable to see Elon hop on a plane and decide to go to Israel [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2338.5s)]
*  Where he took a tour of a kibbutz that had been attacked on October 7th [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2345.62s)]
*  And he met with the president and the Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2349.7000000000003s)]
*  Elon also did a Twitter spaces with Netanyahu. And so here's a clip that we took from a CNN report about [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2354.06s)]
*  Elon's visit those who are intended motor Muslim must be neutralized [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2361.5s)]
*  then [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2365.86s)]
*  But the propaganda was stopped [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2367.2599999999998s)]
*  and then making [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2371.4199999999996s)]
*  Gaza prosperous and if [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2374.2599999999998s)]
*  If that happens, I think we'll be a good future [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2377.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, I hope you'll be involved in it. I'd love to help. Welcome to as well. Mr [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2380.18s)]
*  Musk your visit it means a lot to us [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2384.62s)]
*  You have a huge role to play and I think we need to fight it together [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2387.06s)]
*  Because under the platforms which you lead [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2391.1s)]
*  Unfortunately, there's a harboring of a lot of old hate which is Jew hate which is anti-semitism [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2394.62s)]
*  we have to do whatever we whatever is necessary to [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2400.14s)]
*  Stop the I mean essentially these these these people have been [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2405.8599999999997s)]
*  Fed propaganda since they were children's the first half of that was [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2410.54s)]
*  Elon with Bibi Netanyahu on Twitter spaces. The second half was a press conference. He did with President Herzog [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2414.1s)]
*  What do you think then you think you want to be a key ally in the fight against anti-semitism going forward [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2420.66s)]
*  He sounded really committed to the fight. Yeah, I mean, there's a couple of things here that are really gross [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2425.42s)]
*  One is it you know Elon Musk? Yeah, you know [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2432.2599999999998s)]
*  Is it beyond indulging any semitism? He's endorsed any semitism boosting it? [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2436.1s)]
*  He's welcomed people back to the platform, right who were Nazis and you know tweeting the worst kind of anti-semitic conspiracy theories [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2440.5s)]
*  He himself has tweeted all kinds of [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2447.34s)]
*  conspiracy theory type stuff about like George Soros and and obviously then endorsing the great replacement theory and so [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2450.42s)]
*  Call me not convinced, you know, basically what happened is like he started to lose all these advertisers and he's like [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2457.3s)]
*  Well, what can I do to like stop the bleeding with my you know ex ad revenues? [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2462.54s)]
*  Oh, I can get on a plane Israel [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2466.7400000000002s)]
*  The second thing that I have a problem with here is you know [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2468.3s)]
*  Maybe won't surprise people to know that I have a lot of skepticism about Bibi Netanyahu [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2470.82s)]
*  But you know, this is a we've seen a pattern with Netanyahu where [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2475.54s)]
*  Victor Orban for instance is an ally of Netanyahu's right now and or Bonner buddies Victor Orban is an anti-semitic like Victor Orban [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2480.3399999999997s)]
*  engages in the worst kind of conspiracy theories about George Soros and shadowy Jewish financiers interfering in politics and and also he's [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2487.7799999999997s)]
*  rehabilitated kind of the the Nazi era Hungarian right, you know statues of going up of those types of people and going down of [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2495.94s)]
*  Others, you know like it but as long as he backs Bibi in his kind of politics then [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2503.38s)]
*  Then that's okay. You know, and what I what I'm concerned about here is [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2510.06s)]
*  And we're gonna wait into some difficult watershed Tommy if you wait away hold my hand and walk away on this [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2515.58s)]
*  But essentially there's been this question about like the definition of anti-semitism and and there's been a lot of efforts to kind of equate [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2520.5s)]
*  anti-zionism with anti-semitism and say if you're against [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2526.9s)]
*  Israel essentially [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2530.1s)]
*  you're an anti-semite, you know and [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2531.78s)]
*  What bothers me essentially is sometimes you'll see people you know, like Elon Musk [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2537.34s)]
*  Who are clearly engaged in all manner of anti-semitism, you know all the conspiracy theories about [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2543.1400000000003s)]
*  You know shadowy financiers and Jews replacing us and Jews playing an outside role in society [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2549.1800000000003s)]
*  like these are things that got people killed got my family, you know my family I can you know, I [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2554.5s)]
*  I you know, I I I've actually seen recently like the [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2559.58s)]
*  Documentation of you know what camps my family ended up at like so I you know, this is not [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2566.54s)]
*  This is not something I'm unfamiliar with [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2573.42s)]
*  What I hate is this idea that is so long as you support Israel in its military operation against the Palestinians [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2575.34s)]
*  You can say all this anti-semitic crap over here [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2581.3199999999997s)]
*  Like that is a danger like I don't like this kind of dynamic where it's like well, you know sure [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2583.7799999999997s)]
*  like there's all this any say all the traditional tropes can be [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2589.34s)]
*  Weaponized and can you know percolate on X and all these platforms? [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2593.54s)]
*  So long as you go over and like take a photo op with BB Nanyo and say and we support your effort to neutralize [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2597.5s)]
*  Palestinians like that that is not an answer to any semitism at all [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2603.34s)]
*  In fact, I think that compounds every problem in a way because it's like you're enabling all this anti-semitism over here [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2606.78s)]
*  And you're kind of suggesting that the only thing that matters is like the Israeli military operation like that [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2612.1800000000003s)]
*  That is not fighting any semitism right and remember when Elon got took control of Twitter [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2617.94s)]
*  He declared that he was a free speech absolutist. It's just put that in the back of your mind [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2623.2200000000003s)]
*  So he tweets this crazy thing back at this guy [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2627.14s)]
*  Endorsing the Great Replacement Theory. He also tweeted a bunch of criticisms of the ADL attacking them [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2630.9s)]
*  This is after he had a history of criticize the ADL and net with the president of the ADL Jonathan Greenblatt where they had [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2635.86s)]
*  Sort of like some sort of kumbaya. They came to an agreement shortly after [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2641.06s)]
*  Tweeting in support of the Great Replacement Theory [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2644.7400000000002s)]
*  Elon then says that anyone who tweets the words decolonization from the river to the sea or anything [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2647.5s)]
*  Implying you know euphemisms implying genocide. They'll be suspended from the social media platform [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2655.94s)]
*  So that somehow seems to get him right with the ADL. So he boosts this incredibly dangerous [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2660.6600000000003s)]
*  Conspiracy theory they got people killed very recently in the United States as [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2667.9s)]
*  Has been the motivation behind all kind of like white nationalists [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2672.12s)]
*  Terrorists in this country, but if he bans [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2676.56s)]
*  There's sort of things that are perceived as being anti-israel or pro-palestine [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2679.7200000000003s)]
*  That gets him right with with some of these folks. It's very [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2684.8s)]
*  Cynical as you say that is precisely the point [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2688.7200000000003s)]
*  I was trying to make and you made it better with which because you know [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2691.0s)]
*  And this is not to endorse it from the river to the sea slogan at all [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2694.0s)]
*  But what I find so wrong about the ADL's approach or Jonathan Greenblatt's approach to that whole dynamic is it's like this guy [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2696.92s)]
*  Just endorsed a horrifying anti-semitic conspiracy theory over here [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2704.42s)]
*  He didn't like apologize and explain that just he went and then condemned a Palestinian slogan. It's okay. That's fine [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2708.56s)]
*  Then you're you get a gel-free card. That's that to me is that makes no sense [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2715.96s)]
*  It's no sense and and and I don't know why it's like saying you can it's the same thing with Orban [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2720.84s)]
*  It's like you're allowed to be any cement semite where you are so long as you back what Netanyahu or so long as you? [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2726.24s)]
*  You know quash Palestinians like this is not the way [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2732.3599999999997s)]
*  Any sentence is serious. It needs to be dealt with it needs to be confronted [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2736.68s)]
*  But it has to be confronted across the board and not just you know [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2741.2s)]
*  Something that is equated with whether or not you support [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2745.3199999999997s)]
*  BB Netanyahu's government. Yes, absolutely. And by the way in addition to this scary rise in anti-semitism that we're seeing [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2748.7599999999998s)]
*  There's also been an increase in Islamophobic rhetoric and incidents around the world [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2755.2s)]
*  Including this horrible incident on Saturday [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2759.7999999999997s)]
*  Where three Palestinian college students who are just visiting family up in Burlington, Vermont? [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2762.7599999999998s)]
*  Who were Americans? Yes, yeah, they were shot by some random asshole [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2767.92s)]
*  And again like it's a it's early [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2772.8799999999997s)]
*  But authorities are investigating this incident as a hate crime because you know [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2774.7999999999997s)]
*  They were dressed in a way that made them look Palestinian. They were speaking Arabic, right? [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2779.48s)]
*  So like you know, they're scary things happening [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2783.36s)]
*  And both sides here in six medic incidents and Islamophobic incidents. Yeah, I mean she needs to chill the fuck out here [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2786.92s)]
*  It's a sense is equating all Jews with something. You don't like that. The Israeli government is doing is wrong and fucked up [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2793.6s)]
*  equating all Palestinians [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2801.32s)]
*  Or all Arabs or all Muslims with Hamas is fucked up and can we just? [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2803.1200000000003s)]
*  We don't have to agree on anything else [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2809.2400000000002s)]
*  If we can disagree on that we can save ourselves a lot of trouble well said [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2811.9599999999996s)]
*  Last thing on on Gaza been so as listeners to the show [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2816.64s)]
*  No [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2820.2599999999998s)]
*  We've been trying to lift up voices of people who have been harmed by this war in both ways in an earlier episode [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2820.4799999999996s)]
*  We played a clip from a journalist named nor Harzine [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2826.68s)]
*  She was talking about basically what life was like in Gaza at the moment [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2829.4399999999996s)]
*  We are very happy that we were finally able to get back in touch with her after many weeks [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2832.9799999999996s)]
*  And here is nor just basically given an update on life for her these days all these weeks later [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2836.8s)]
*  I'm with my family [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2842.2200000000003s)]
*  My kids and my husband and my parents everyone is fine [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2844.0800000000004s)]
*  We [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2850.48s)]
*  Personally, we did not get any aid because basically most of the aid is going to people who are sheltering inside UN schools [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2851.96s)]
*  for now [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2860.4s)]
*  And that's actually a big problem [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2862.76s)]
*  So the people who are sheltering in governmental schools or in hospitals or in shops or in the streets or in? [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2864.8s)]
*  each other's homes [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2872.96s)]
*  They do not get any aid. They did not get any aid until now. I did not manage to [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2875.28s)]
*  Go and see my home, but according to people in the area [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2881.84s)]
*  I mean we talked to some of them a week ago, and they said that the home is still standing [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2886.08s)]
*  But without walls [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2891.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's like an open area [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2894.3199999999997s)]
*  It is standing but it is like completely damaged [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2898.12s)]
*  So even if this war ends and we go back to our home [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2901.62s)]
*  We will not be able to live in it because there is no walls. So yes, technically it's completely destroyed [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2905.24s)]
*  I mean just a another example of you know, the fact that the work at end today the ceasefire can be made permanent today [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2911.24s)]
*  But for millions of people like I mean [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2918.0s)]
*  unthinkable [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2921.48s)]
*  recognizable, yeah, yeah and you'll hear in the interview, I mean [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2922.44s)]
*  Unruh runs some of those schools with they're getting aid and she makes the point that [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2926.52s)]
*  It has to go go into the product. There's no food in the grocery stores. There's no bakeries [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2930.92s)]
*  There's no, you know, so it's not like people might say well [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2935.92s)]
*  Not only is the aid not getting they've nowhere to go to get food in water. So [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2939.7200000000003s)]
*  Clearly that needs to be dressed and man if this military operation resumes and goes on for weeks and weeks and weeks [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2944.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't know what happens to those people. Yeah, I don't either. Okay, we're gonna take a quick break. We come back [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2949.52s)]
*  We're gonna talk about some major elections in Argentina and Netherlands to stick around for that [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=2953.96s)]

*  So first Argentina elected a far-right [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3027.44s)]
*  Libertarian slash anarcho-capitalist named Javier Millet to be its next president then in the Netherlands the far-right [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3030.52s)]
*  Anti-immigrant party for freedom did extremely well in parliamentary elections much better than expected [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3037.84s)]
*  Which means a guy named Herta Wilders may be the next prime minister [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3042.92s)]
*  The Netherlands so let's take this one at a time Ben. So Millet we talked about before [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3048.4s)]
*  He ran on eliminating Argentina's central bank [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3052.56s)]
*  Big tax cuts making abortion illegal extreme deregulation to the point where he talked about [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3056.04s)]
*  Allowing the sale of organs [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3062.92s)]
*  He cloned his dog apparently and attacked him [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3064.96s)]
*  He's just a crazy person [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3068.0s)]
*  But mostly his message was you know [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3068.92s)]
*  I'm gonna destroy the political class that has gotten Argentina to this place with 140% inflation and economic catastrophe [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3070.76s)]
*  And literally campaigned holding a chainsaw at all his rallies [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3078.2400000000002s)]
*  Builders is over the Netherlands is best known for his Islamophobia [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3082.0s)]
*  He wants to ban the Quran shut down all mosques [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3086.28s)]
*  He wants to drastically reduce immigration and he ran on the Netherlands leaving the European Union [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3089.32s)]
*  So builders, you know, he will have to form a coalition with other political parties [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3095.2000000000003s)]
*  So it's not clear he'll be in charge yet [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3100.1200000000003s)]
*  He would probably have to moderate on a bunch of issues to get other parties into a coalition with him [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3103.0s)]
*  But his surprisingly strong victory was quite alarming [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3108.6s)]
*  So Ben, you know, these are obviously two very different countries the Netherlands and in Argentina [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3113.52s)]
*  But these guys have a few things in common one. They look like scary grandparents from the Twilight movie [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3117.4s)]
*  Right, you got the fucking coked out. Yeah werewolf and then builders is like the ghostly pale like [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3123.52s)]
*  The creepy guy next door, you know, yeah, he's drinking your blood [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3129.56s)]
*  Yeah, to they were congratulated by all the shittiest people in public life [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3132.52s)]
*  Trump Elon Musk Victor Orban all saying that away and then third they both basically ran as populace who wanted to burn the establishment down [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3136.2s)]
*  So then what do you think these two elections tell us about the rise of these far-right populace? [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3143.48s)]
*  And are you worried about one of these characters potentially doing more damage than the other? [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3148.3599999999997s)]
*  Well, I think it tells you that [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3155.7999999999997s)]
*  That the the [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3159.8399999999997s)]
*  anti-establishment rage [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3162.2s)]
*  Is not at all abating it's interesting. I have a friend from Argentina who said, you know, hey, I disagree with you [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3164.3599999999997s)]
*  I which you have to understand is we fucking hate all our politicians, you know [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3171.3999999999996s)]
*  like like and he made you know, I I still don't agree with the solution but like [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3175.74s)]
*  You know, he made this case of like you have no idea what it's been like to live with these fucking politicians for you know [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3179.74s)]
*  Who basically one after another wrecked things, you know, right now what I'm interested in watching Argentina [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3186.04s)]
*  I do think if this guy did everything he said I don't even like I don't know what would happen [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3191.56s)]
*  Like the country would break it will he follow through the so I you know, so with him [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3195.92s)]
*  I think the question is essentially, you know [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3201.12s)]
*  How much has he actually tried to implement his program? [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3203.56s)]
*  Is that even possible because he doesn't control all of the legislature and things like this [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3205.54s)]
*  I think in some way and we've talked a lot about Latin American populism just a sense of like any like this to be Kayleigh [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3209.0s)]
*  Like a wreck it all model that is concerning and that it by the way doesn't fit on an ideological spectrum [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3215.68s)]
*  I don't think it's all far-right [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3221.8799999999997s)]
*  I think it's just anybody that comes along and is like I want to burn it down [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3222.9199999999996s)]
*  Like people are like here for that and that's a problem [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3225.9199999999996s)]
*  I want to focus more on builders here. This guy's been around long time [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3228.2799999999997s)]
*  So what what to me is scary about him is unlike our because you can kind of understand the guy who comes out of nowhere [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3232.68s)]
*  And it's like oh, there's some new guy. Let's try him out. This guy's like the little pen of the Netherlands [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3238.8799999999997s)]
*  That's what's scary to me. It's like it's not like Dutch people don't know who this guy is [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3244.6000000000004s)]
*  They know damn well fucking hates immigrants. He hates Muslims. He says terrible things [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3248.04s)]
*  He's a nationalist. He's a racist and fine at me Dutch listeners. If you don't agree with me, I'm sorry [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3253.44s)]
*  I've seen enough from this guy. I'm throwing the flag like that's who this guy is and [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3260.06s)]
*  What's concerning me about that is number one the Netherlands generally has been this like very reasonable, you know [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3264.56s)]
*  Kind of center of European politics. I mean, this is a OG European Union country [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3270.24s)]
*  This is like these are very reasonable people like I love Dutch people like and so [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3275.4399999999996s)]
*  This is not the country that you expect to have wild swings in politics, right? I mean you know, I [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3280.9599999999996s)]
*  Won't name other you well, but yeah, it's not the kind of country you expect to have wild swings in politics [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3286.7599999999998s)]
*  so to me what this tells me is that the combination of a cost of living crisis of [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3291.52s)]
*  Refugees coming in not just obviously from all parts of the world, but you know an influx of Ukrainian refugees of [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3298.36s)]
*  Love feeling that like the traditional parties are not responding and frankly just some old-fashioned national xenophobia [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3309.0s)]
*  That is kind of reemerged on the scene in Europe [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3315.36s)]
*  Not a place where you want that to happen by the way, it usually leads to really dark places that this you know at some point [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3317.36s)]
*  It's a trend, you know [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3323.24s)]
*  And we saw some good news in Poland and Spain and so we're feeling pretty good [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3324.5s)]
*  But you know, this makes you wonder we got a French election coming up in a couple years [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3327.42s)]
*  Can Marine Le Pen kind of surf this wave? [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3332.8199999999997s)]
*  We obviously already have someone in Italy who surfed that wave although she's monitored a tiny bit in office [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3335.7s)]
*  But to me this shows that there's like a resiliency to the far right in Europe [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3340.3399999999997s)]
*  It doesn't mean that the sky is falling because like I said, you could point to Poland and Spain as good news stories, too [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3346.02s)]
*  But you know, I do think that we ignore at our peril this kind of building [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3351.52s)]
*  You know and it's same thing here in this country, by the way [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3357.96s)]
*  I mean, it's a warning sign for here big time, you know [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3360.8999999999996s)]
*  Because it's the same mix of stuff that people are pissed off about they're pissed off about immigration. They're pissed off about cost of living [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3363.12s)]
*  I don't agree with their views on [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3368.7599999999998s)]
*  immigration in particular when it comes to a guy like builders [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3372.0s)]
*  it's just a warning sign and [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3374.92s)]
*  and not it, you know and [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3377.3599999999997s)]
*  It's gonna require I think [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3380.04s)]
*  pro-democracy [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3382.6400000000003s)]
*  Anti-ethno nationalist forces to band together in these countries that there need to be coalitions built [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3383.7200000000003s)]
*  These parties on the center right and center left and left in the Europe can't fight it out with each other and create openings [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3389.2400000000002s)]
*  For people like this. They need to get behind alternatives. Yeah, I mean I agree with you like Mille is [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3394.88s)]
*  Singularly weird guy. I mean he seemed to have a [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3400.28s)]
*  Mental breakdown on live TV near the end of the campaign [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3403.2000000000003s)]
*  Like he started saying he was hearing voices in an empty studio and they still voted for him [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3405.62s)]
*  I guess 140% [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3409.54s)]
*  Inflational to that for you, but I'm with you like builders is he's the longest-serving member of parliament in the Dutch Parliament [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3411.2999999999997s)]
*  He started as sort of like a guy in a center-right party and then in 2006 he left to start this anti-muslim populist party [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3416.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I agree that what this tells me is one the left in a lot of these countries including the Greens are just like [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3422.38s)]
*  They're not getting traction and to the playbook for these populists could not be more simple [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3428.38s)]
*  It's like you pledge to [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3433.94s)]
*  Do more social spending you pledge to fuck with elites [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3436.3s)]
*  You say you're gonna block immigrants from coming into the country and you pick some group to demagogue in builders case [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3440.86s)]
*  It was Muslims in part because of you know, the Syrian refugee crisis [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3447.26s)]
*  You just sort of left on that years and years ago and slowly built support [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3451.36s)]
*  Yeah, and I mean you saw like, you know, there were riots in Ireland from far-right people in Ireland, right? [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3454.78s)]
*  Like like this is there's something going on here and by the way, I really do think it's bullshit [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3462.14s)]
*  I think this is scapegoat escape the immigration [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3467.34s)]
*  They're scapegoating immigrants for other problems to it. Oh, the cost of living problems or employment problems, you know in that but again like [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3471.22s)]
*  There's a really dangerous history of where that leads in Europe [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3480.3s)]
*  Yeah, and I don't know if that's the case in the Netherlands, but both certainly both in the US and in the UK [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3483.7s)]
*  The immigration systems are being overwhelmed by the number of asylum seekers [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3488.54s)]
*  And so you're seeing really gross responses from conservative governments like over in the UK [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3493.16s)]
*  They're threatening to send people to Rwanda even if they have absolutely no connection to the country like that's their plan [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3497.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3504.4399999999996s)]
*  And and the other challenge here is that there does need to be an effort to kind of fix and fortify and strengthen [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3504.9799999999996s)]
*  Asylum procedures and and to have kind of a rationalized process here [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3511.14s)]
*  But what some of these right-wing governments do is that they actually disrupt that because they kind of like the [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3516.08s)]
*  Illegality of the immigration system, right? [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3522.7599999999998s)]
*  And and and so it's same thing in this country [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3525.0s)]
*  But instead of passing immigration reform and rationalizing the system like you guys talked about yesterday, right? [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3528.04s)]
*  Path to citizenship for people over here more legal immigration, but also border security [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3532.56s)]
*  You know more asylum judges to make that system work in a more efficacious matter [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3537.16s)]
*  They want it broken so they can demagogue yes, they go on Fox News [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3541.96s)]
*  Yeah a couple more quick things so a few months ago [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3545.08s)]
*  We talked about how Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made this extraordinary [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3547.56s)]
*  Statement where he accused the Indian government of being behind the assassination of a guy named Hardeep Singh Najjar [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3551.28s)]
*  Who was a supporter of the creation of an independent state for the Sikh religious group? [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3556.44s)]
*  Last week the Financial Times reported that US authorities quote [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3561.7200000000003s)]
*  thwarted a conspiracy to [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3565.56s)]
*  Assassinate a Sikh separatist on American soil and issued a warning to India's government over concerns. It was involved in the plot [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3567.04s)]
*  So this target was a dual US Canadian citizen [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3573.64s)]
*  This guy was a senior leader for US based groups that advocates for an independent Sikh state [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3577.56s)]
*  The FT said that Biden raised the issue directly with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the G20 in September [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3582.7599999999998s)]
*  Which by the way was in India. I'm sure that was a good time [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3589.92s)]
*  And remember that Modi just got a state visit in Washington back in June and addressed the joint session of Congress [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3592.56s)]
*  The White House says that when they raised this with Indian officials, they were quote surprised and concerned [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3597.96s)]
*  So Ben, I guess like best case here is Modi has some kind of rogue element in the security [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3605.6s)]
*  Apparatus doing unbelievably stupid stuff targeting these Sikh separatist leaders [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3611.88s)]
*  But the worst case is that he knows about it. He's sanctioning it. He somehow thinks it's okay [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3616.48s)]
*  To try to kill people American citizens in the US and Canadian citizens in Canada [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3622.12s)]
*  That is a big deal and has some you know serious implications for I don't know everything the US wants to do on every issue [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3628.12s)]
*  with India [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3634.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean this you know, unfortunately wasn't surprising [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3636.16s)]
*  and I hope that this you know, I we've been saying like the US should get Candice back on this and [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3640.16s)]
*  Certainly reinforces that idea because look it just this is a norm that cannot be violated [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3647.72s)]
*  If it's fair game to just start, you know assassinating people in [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3654.04s)]
*  in other countries like the [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3658.8s)]
*  International system of borders can't work, you know, and so [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3661.0s)]
*  I I'm a little skeptical that that somehow there's like a rogue element in the Indian government [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3664.4s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if they were shocked and surprised [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3670.44s)]
*  About that happening or they're shocked and surprised that they're confronted by it but like I [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3672.7200000000003s)]
*  Really hope the message gets crossed and by the way [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3678.2000000000003s)]
*  I also hope that it means that they're not gonna like try to punish Canada because they're smaller and easier to punish in the United [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3680.04s)]
*  States [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3685.28s)]
*  And it also bears repeating [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3686.2000000000003s)]
*  It's not like there's some massive Sikh insurgency and you know, there's a imminent, you know in no declaration of independence [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3689.04s)]
*  And you know Punjab or something like this is tiny [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3696.68s)]
*  This is a paranoid mindset, I mean that part of what is so alarming about this is just like the deep [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3700.16s)]
*  Nationalism and paranoia that seems to be behind this it just just time slow your roll guys, you know [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3706.4s)]
*  Yeah, stop doing stupid things. Yeah, Modi you're in decision. You're a big powerful country [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3711.48s)]
*  You don't need to do this kind of crap. You know, no not at all. In fact, it'll only hurt you [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3717.2799999999997s)]
*  last week we focused that whole episode on the upcoming cop climate change conference in the United Arab Emirates and we talked a [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3721.52s)]
*  Lot about how there's a lot of activists [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3728.48s)]
*  We talked a bunch of activists who feel like it's ridiculous and cynical to hold a climate change conference in a major oil and gas [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3730.8399999999997s)]
*  producing country like the UAE [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3739.3199999999997s)]
*  Unfortunately, Ben since then it's gotten worse [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3742.3199999999997s)]
*  So just days before cop 28 starts the BBC published leaked documents that show how [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3744.48s)]
*  The UAE is planning to use the upcoming summit to meet with countries to pitch them on new oil and gas deals [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3750.64s)]
*  So that really sucks. Yeah kind of your most worst-case cynical [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3757.16s)]
*  I mean like but is anybody surprised? I mean, what do you think would happen? You get a lot of [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3762.6s)]
*  Wealthy people in a room you make some deals, you know, whether those deals have to do with renewable energy or fossil fuels [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3769.16s)]
*  You know, I mean, do you think this leaking out now could maybe I don't know [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3774.64s)]
*  Make the UAE fall obligated to go a little further on on doing the right thing on renewables on anything [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3778.2799999999997s)]
*  I think the UAE approach to this thing is that they have a lot of they're very in a cash-poor world [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3783.76s)]
*  They're cash rich, right? [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3789.32s)]
*  And so their their solution is probably like we're gonna we're gonna try to surprise on the upside with all of our commitments for [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3790.36s)]
*  Resourcing around yeah other things it what I would what I would you know urge the UAE to do if they want to do that game [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3797.1200000000003s)]
*  Is don't do the like, you know [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3803.8s)]
*  over the next 30 years, we're gonna spend a [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3806.76s)]
*  Gazillion dollars on renewables with no kind of hard money put some real money in the loss and damage fund [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3810.36s)]
*  You know like the UAE could really fucking you know, make that thing real top that off. Yeah top that off a little bit [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3815.42s)]
*  Lasting for Ben's interview. So we have talked about former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro many times on this show [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3822.92s)]
*  None of them have been for good reasons [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3828.92s)]
*  This is definitely the weirdest though [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3831.7200000000003s)]
*  So it wasn't even is it weirder than when he was in like that was what fast food restaurant was it was like? [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3833.2400000000002s)]
*  Chick-fil-a or something and was the chifle? Yeah. Yeah, he was just cruising around like [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3837.68s)]
*  Yeah, well you decide if this is weirder [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3842.04s)]
*  So Brazilian media reported that federal police in Brazil are investigating Bolsonaro for harassing a humpback whale while [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3844.68s)]
*  He was out tooling around on his jet ski [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3852.6s)]
*  So the report says Bolsonaro was shooting a video on his phone of this poor whale [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3854.64s)]
*  15 meters from the thing while it was like jumping up and down slapping its arms showing signs of distress [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3859.36s)]
*  Brazilian law says boats with their engines on can't get within a hundred meters of a whale [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3864.96s)]
*  According to the Guardian newspaper Bolsonaro wouldn't be the first right-wing politician to get in trouble for harassing a whale in Brazil a decade ago [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3869.52s)]
*  Bolsonaro also apparently got fined for illegal fishing in a marine reserve [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3877.88s)]
*  In response to this whale report Bolsonaro said quote every day they accused me of some kind of mischief yesterday [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3882.12s)]
*  It was hounding whales Bolsonaro told supporters and then he made a disparaging remark about Brazil's justice minister whom he likened to a whale [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3889.72s)]
*  So it sounds like he's learning his lesson. I [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3896.9199999999996s)]
*  Mean can we just like I'll leave the fucking whales alone. I mean [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3900.72s)]
*  If you see that humpback whales are wonderful animals or mammals, you know [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3905.7999999999997s)]
*  One of the coolest moments of my life Hannah and I were in Maui and we went on a whale watch [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3909.8399999999997s)]
*  Way way further than a hundred meters away from any of these things by the way, well, we saw [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3915.56s)]
*  Two whales breach at the same time jump up kind of did like a 50 degree rotation landed back down truly [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3921.6s)]
*  Like that's a good transformer of moment. It was amazing. I just one of my first memories is of being five [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3928.44s)]
*  I think it was my fifth birthday party. My mom took me and some friends on a whale watch [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3933.94s)]
*  I have always loved whales my favorite book growing up, which I've now I recommend this for you actually [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3937.56s)]
*  Amos and Boris I read this my kids all the time. It's about a whale [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3943.64s)]
*  That rescues a mouse in the middle of the ocean. Okay and takes the mouse all the way home [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3947.8799999999997s)]
*  I'm bought in and then wait for it [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3952.96s)]
*  The whale is washed up on the shore where the mouse lives many years later in a hurricane and is dying on the shore and [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3955.8399999999997s)]
*  The mouse goes and gets two elephants to push the whale back in the water. So it's about the friendship between a whale and a mouse [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3962.7999999999997s)]
*  It's kind of a metaphor for something that's lovely. It's quite powerful Amos and Boris check. That's great [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=3969.4s)]

*  Just to begin [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4121.280000000001s)]
*  Are those of you who are watching this? [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4122.88s)]

*  Just to begin our listeners have obviously been following things quite closely [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4129.2s)]
*  But could you share with us just what it was like for you? [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4134.56s)]
*  To be on the ground in Gaza and and how you'd compare the conditions there now to [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4139.84s)]
*  You know previous life in Gaza even previous wars in Gaza [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4146.08s)]
*  Ben for the simple reason is that this war is unprecedented and the level of destruction the [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4149.759999999999s)]
*  Volume the speed [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4158.24s)]
*  Of this war and hey, they've been phenomenal [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4160.719999999999s)]
*  Displacement of people like you said Andra is hosting right now more than 1 million people in our shelters [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4164.46s)]
*  We have to open [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4172.08s)]
*  556 shelters across the Gaza Strip in the north in the middle in the south [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4173.82s)]
*  I visited one of those shelters in the south in Khan Younes [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4178.62s)]
*  And it was appalling. I mean people were literally on top of each other [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4183.82s)]
*  We're hosting only in that shelter 30 000 people this previously used to be a training center for Andra [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4189.26s)]
*  A vocational training center like a college for Andra [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4196.62s)]
*  so [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4200.78s)]
*  Conditions there were absolutely inhumane [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4202.46s)]
*  People shared [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4208.54s)]
*  Four square meter for five or six people for whole family [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4211.26s)]
*  Some people who had moved early on during the war [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4216.06s)]
*  They were not able to change their clothes because they left so so quickly [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4219.66s)]
*  There was not much clean water they people had one meal a day if if at all [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4226.86s)]
*  um [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4233.1s)]
*  And then there were people who arrived recently [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4234.94s)]
*  So just a few days before I visited. Um, those were the people who stayed until [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4238.38s)]
*  The very end if you wish in the north did not want to leave their homes [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4244.14s)]
*  Because who wants to leave their home? [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4248.54s)]
*  um [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4252.06s)]
*  And they were the ones who arrived already a very very crowded shelter [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4253.02s)]
*  um and [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4258.7s)]
*  They slept on the concrete floor. So we're currently in this period of pause [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4260.3s)]
*  And part of that agreement is that there's supposed to be more assistance getting in across the rafa crossing into gaza [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4266.3s)]
*  um [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4272.9400000000005s)]
*  What is your sense of of what is actually getting in? [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4274.3s)]
*  how [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4278.06s)]
*  How much more is needed to to meet these humanitarian needs? [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4279.18s)]
*  How valuable is this time of pause and and yet how big is the challenge that remains in terms of? [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4283.18s)]
*  Of the type of assistance it needs to get to people it's most valuable for [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4288.86s)]
*  The people of gaza in terms of the respite this pause has brought with it [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4295.1s)]
*  because you see I was there before the post kicked in and [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4300.54s)]
*  It was constant constant bombardment during the day during the night [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4304.78s)]
*  I was awoken myself to the sound of heavy bombardment and one could [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4308.94s)]
*  not help [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4315.18s)]
*  but think about [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4316.38s)]
*  The fact that people in gaza have lived through this bombardment these airstrikes [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4318.14s)]
*  This brutal war for more than 50 days, right? [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4323.02s)]
*  Um, so it certainly brought respite to to people [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4326.22s)]
*  um [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4330.38s)]
*  Our colleagues and people in the shelter they were very much anticipating and waiting anxiously for this post [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4331.660000000001s)]
*  So certainly that's very very welcome and the extension of the pause for another two days as of last night was was very very good [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4338.06s)]
*  And yes, you're absolutely right in the sense that [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4346.06s)]
*  More aid more humanitarian aid has finally started trickling into gaza [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4350.14s)]
*  a significant increase in the [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4355.66s)]
*  Supplies that have been coming in we are also seeing fuel coming in [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4358.3s)]
*  Which was banned until just a few days before the pause. I mean andrea itself [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4363.1s)]
*  Um run out of fuel [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4368.62s)]
*  If you recall and we had to bring our operations to a total halt because fuel was not coming into gaza [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4370.7s)]
*  So now we have that which is very good. Some cooking gas is coming in [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4376.94s)]
*  What is really really needed is a boost to the private sector. So to open more crossing points that would bring in [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4381.82s)]
*  commercial supplies including via kerim shalom, which was the crossing point that gaza had with israel [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4389.26s)]
*  before the war began [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4395.18s)]
*  Because the private sector is completely dead [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4398.14s)]
*  We were driving around every single shop was closed. The pharmacies were closed. The banks were closed [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4400.860000000001s)]
*  Um, there were a few vegetable stalls here and there [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4406.780000000001s)]
*  Um a few bakeries were open with very very long queues [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4409.820000000001s)]
*  So humanitarian assistance cannot do it alone and there needs to be a revival of the markets in gaza [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4414.14s)]
*  so I I wanted to just kind of take stock for people of of what has already happened in terms of the scale of the [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4419.9800000000005s)]
*  the suffering and and I want to be [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4425.74s)]
*  sensitive to the fact that [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4427.8s)]
*  You know unra itself has suffered significant losses in terms of [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4429.98s)]
*  personnel, um, can you describe to people just the the the colleagues that have already been lost, um, [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4434.36s)]
*  the type of people that have have worked for unra who who've suffered or or even died in this in this war? Yeah, we [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4441.18s)]
*  Have 108 colleagues who were who were killed since the war began [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4449.9s)]
*  This is the highest number that the united nations has recorded since its establishment [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4454.54s)]
*  More than 70 years ago. Um, it's a huge loss. It's unprecedented for the agency [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4461.9s)]
*  We had staff killed in previous wars, but never at this level. So this is another [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4468.139999999999s)]
*  Proof that this war has been very very brutal [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4474.7s)]
*  These were colleagues of ours who were mainly teachers. Some of them were school principals [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4479.259999999999s)]
*  Some were staff counselors. Um, we had a doctor gynecologist serene one of the very very few health [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4485.179999999999s)]
*  Specialists in in in gaza one of the few gynecologists in in gaza. In fact, um, we have support staff [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4493.5s)]
*  drivers warehouse workers [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4501.0199999999995s)]
*  staff safety [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4503.9s)]
*  Colleagues many many of our colleagues were killed while they were at home many were killed with their families. We had one [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4505.42s)]
*  Young colleague. In fact the youngest colleague who was killed she was in her early 20s. She [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4514.06s)]
*  um [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4519.18s)]
*  Was physically disabled and she was a software developer in um one of our information technology [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4520.22s)]
*  centers, um [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4526.92s)]
*  The agency is never going to be the same without these these colleagues. Well, we're really sorry [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4529.42s)]
*  I think there's you know, not enough attention, frankly on the sacrifices being made [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4535.5s)]
*  I mean, I I guess [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4540.38s)]
*  and talk a little bit about unruh may be [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4542.540000000001s)]
*  not well known to [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4545.660000000001s)]
*  Our listeners, uh [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4548.540000000001s)]
*  I'm curious how the mission changes because in normal times which are not normal in gaza ever because it's been under blockade [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4550.700000000001s)]
*  But as as your description of the colleagues you've lost [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4558.700000000001s)]
*  Demonstrates, you know, you're running schools. You're helping with the health care infrastructure. You're really just helping with the basic services [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4561.66s)]
*  inside of gaza [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4569.02s)]
*  whereas in a war, uh now you have this responsibility for these enormous amounts of [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4570.46s)]
*  shelter and and just kind of basic needs [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4576.38s)]
*  How does the organization kind of? [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4579.66s)]
*  Adjust to that mission in in the context of a war like how how would you describe what unruh is doing? [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4582.38s)]
*  For the people of gaza [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4590.14s)]
*  Right now and in the days to come before the war unruh ran schools in in gaza [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4592.38s)]
*  You see we are the only united nations agency that operates schools around the region and in the world. In fact [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4598.3s)]
*  No other un agency operates schools and we have 700 schools across the region [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4606.9400000000005s)]
*  Uh half a million boys and girls go to our schools the vast majority of our students are in fact in gaza [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4612.7s)]
*  300,000 of them we sadly had to close our schools when the war began in gaza on the 7th of october [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4621.0s)]
*  And many of our schools we turned them to be shelters. This is also another unique [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4628.860000000001s)]
*  Aspect of the work of unruh in in the gaza strip in the sense that [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4635.900000000001s)]
*  It's one of the very very few places in the world and certainly [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4641.26s)]
*  um the scale that the united nations agency opens its facilities to [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4644.94s)]
*  Take in displaced people and now we have more than one million people a huge responsibility [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4652.46s)]
*  Like you said and even those shelters are not protected. We had recorded [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4658.22s)]
*  80 incidents [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4664.7s)]
*  Where these facilities including the the shelters have come have been hit during um during the war [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4666.54s)]
*  So even the un flag was violated even [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4673.74s)]
*  The un facilities were not spared during this brutal war [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4677.58s)]
*  And so when these crises happen in gaza and in other parts of the region [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4682.3s)]
*  UNRWA shifts gears from providing basic services like health and education primarily to respond to emergencies [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4687.98s)]
*  So we have the shelters in the case of the gaza strip and with the shelters, of course come the [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4695.26s)]
*  Basic [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4702.06s)]
*  Um life-saving assistance. So that's food clean water [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4703.18s)]
*  um cleaning material [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4707.34s)]
*  And protection and safety where where we can [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4710.540000000001s)]
*  Our teams regardless of the fact that they themselves have endured huge losses [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4714.06s)]
*  Whether it's the colleagues that we've just spoken about or family members and loved ones and friends and neighbors [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4719.18s)]
*  Physical losses many of our colleagues have been displaced themselves. They had to flee their homes [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4727.820000000001s)]
*  Our colleagues have been on the front lines [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4733.58s)]
*  Catering and providing to those families and those displaced people who need us most [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4735.8s)]
*  When we say these are our unsung heroes [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4741.42s)]
*  It's not um, just a gimmick or a good sound bite. It's the truth [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4744.860000000001s)]
*  And I had the absolute honor to reunite with many of them when I was in gaza just a few days ago [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4749.1s)]
*  And so one of the there's obviously assuming the military operation resumes. We know that there'll be these [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4755.18s)]
*  terrible [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4761.320000000001s)]
*  um humanitarian needs and and and [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4762.54s)]
*  Continued civilian suffering. I think one of the issues that it's hard to get your mind around is also just the scale of people [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4766.04s)]
*  who are displaced and who may be [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4772.22s)]
*  maybe [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4774.38s)]
*  Left homeless by the scale of destruction of buildings in gaza [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4775.58s)]
*  Has have you even begun at unread to begin to think through? [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4781.26s)]
*  You know if the fighting does stop and we hope it, you know, obviously that there's a longer term ceasefire [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4786.0599999999995s)]
*  But but what is going to happen? You know, how many people do you think are going to be? [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4791.26s)]
*  homeless or displaced [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4796.38s)]
*  How do you begin to think about the resources that are going to be necessary? [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4799.0199999999995s)]
*  To both meet immediate humanitarian needs but also just provide shelter for people [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4803.1s)]
*  While gaza hopefully is rebuilt and a process that could take years if not decades given the scale of destruction [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4808.860000000001s)]
*  look ben the level of destruction is [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4815.26s)]
*  Unbelievable. I just got some footage from [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4819.96s)]
*  A visit of our teams who finally managed to have a breakthrough and go to the north of the gaza strip [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4824.38s)]
*  And they went to jubilee, which is the largest palestinian refugee camp in in gaza [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4832.22s)]
*  One of eight by the way, so they managed to get through [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4837.9s)]
*  to that camp and [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4841.58s)]
*  They sent us this footage of I mean the place looks like it's been hit by an earthquake [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4843.58s)]
*  Except it's man-made the level of destruction is just humongous [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4848.94s)]
*  And i've been in places like iraq during the isis operation [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4853.099999999999s)]
*  I've been to libya during the war. I served in libya. I served in syria for for many years. I visited aleppo after [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4858.320000000001s)]
*  um the war there [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4865.76s)]
*  I've seen destruction. I've I I was in southern yemen, uh in hudaydah during heavy heavy military operations [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4868.16s)]
*  um [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4875.68s)]
*  This is huge. This is just driving through kilometers and kilometers of of destruction and [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4876.56s)]
*  I know gaza and I know gaza city. I've been many times before the war started [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4882.88s)]
*  It's unrecognizable [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4887.76s)]
*  and so I can't even begin to assess the the damage or what is going to be needed after the [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4889.52s)]
*  After the the war is over [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4896.64s)]
*  How much longer will people continue to live in our shelters the impact that this has on? [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4899.4400000000005s)]
*  Schooling as an example because the vast majority of our shelters are schools [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4906.8s)]
*  um, so [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4911.76s)]
*  The impact on children and children's education the impact on a whole generation of palestinian children in gaza [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4913.28s)]
*  um [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4920.96s)]
*  And the cost the cost of all of this and who's going to be responsible to reconstruct [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4921.84s)]
*  Is there going to be anything to to reconstruct and this is this is why it's absolutely fundamental that this pose which is [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4927.28s)]
*  Very welcome and very positive turns into a longer-term [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4934.88s)]
*  humanitarian ceasefire [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4939.34s)]
*  For also to do assessments to understand the level of destruction [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4940.96s)]
*  um to to to see you know [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4945.6s)]
*  Can anything be fixed and how? [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4948.64s)]
*  um, and yes, it is very very different than previous wars that um that gaza has been through in the past 16 years alone [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4951.12s)]
*  They've been through five or six conflicts already and obviously if the military operation resumes in the south [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4958.8s)]
*  This just gets much harder, uh, and the scale of uh gets much worse [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4965.28s)]
*  Uh, what when what what is your message to the you know? [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4970.4s)]
*  The rel I will I used to say international community. I'm not sure that that's a something that exists anymore [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4975.12s)]
*  But to the you know, the united states the arab states [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4981.12s)]
*  uh european governments, what what would you like to see? [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4985.2s)]
*  the the relevant, uh international players doing [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4989.52s)]
*  To both try to bring the border and end but also to to begin to address [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=4994.48s)]
*  This humanitarian challenge in gaza and to try to offer some some long-term hope for the people especially the children of gaza [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5000.0s)]
*  To put more pressure on parties to the conflict to bring an end to this war [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5007.44s)]
*  There are no winners in in this war [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5014.8s)]
*  And there's there's no there shouldn't be any competition on on in suffering there's been [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5019.04s)]
*  Um [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5024.72s)]
*  14 000 people [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5027.66s)]
*  Who are reported dead? [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5029.76s)]
*  We do know according to reports and estimates that the vast majority in fact 70 percent [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5031.36s)]
*  Are women and children? [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5038.56s)]
*  um according to a latest [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5040.8s)]
*  media report the number of women and children killed in just [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5043.92s)]
*  Over 50 days in in gaza [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5048.96s)]
*  Um is more than the number of women and children killed in ukraine in two years of war [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5051.6s)]
*  um [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5059.44s)]
*  Not of course comparing suffering to suffering but just to give a context on [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5060.4s)]
*  The volume the velocity and the levels of destruction in only 50 days [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5065.52s)]
*  for four people in gaza and it's also [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5070.8s)]
*  about [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5074.16s)]
*  pushing this region further away from [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5075.84s)]
*  Any prospects for peace for stability? [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5080.08s)]
*  the longer this war goes on the [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5084.32s)]
*  Wider the gap between people is going to be [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5088.16s)]
*  The farther away we are pushed from any solution any prospect [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5092.719999999999s)]
*  um the deepening of this dehumanization that we're seeing or we've seen [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5098.08s)]
*  um in in the context of of of gaza [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5103.839999999999s)]
*  Um, the more isolated people are going to feel in gaza [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5107.52s)]
*  um [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5112.400000000001s)]
*  so [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5113.4400000000005s)]
*  The shorter this war the better for everyone [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5115.360000000001s)]
*  And the urgency to [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5119.68s)]
*  reach a humanitarian ceasefire as a first step after this pause [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5123.360000000001s)]
*  Um is absolutely critical [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5129.92s)]
*  and until then the use of [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5132.4800000000005s)]
*  Food water fuel as weapons of war [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5137.28s)]
*  Um should come to an end because for two whole weeks there was a hermetic siege on [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5140.96s)]
*  In the gaza strip where nothing came in not one drop of water not one bag of flour [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5146.8s)]
*  Let alone fuel [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5153.360000000001s)]
*  Um and so for two weeks people had nothing and that actually [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92wGrqFgR3w&t=5155.2s)]
