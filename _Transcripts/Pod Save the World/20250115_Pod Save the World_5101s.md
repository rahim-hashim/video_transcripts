**Pod Save the World:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU)
*  Welcome back to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Ben Rhodes. So last week, uh, prepping the show seems like a long time ago last week [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=7.04s)]
*  It's like tuesday I sit in the office to look out the window [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=7.28s)]
*  You see this massive plume of smoke rising in building and building building and then after we taped it had basically covered [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=9.36s)]
*  All of the west side of Los Angeles, but uh, we still had no idea [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=15.6s)]
*  I mean it was ominous, but we had no idea what was gonna happen [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=20.16s)]
*  So I remember last yeah last week. I was I had a dentist appointment in the morning and it's on san vicente [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=22.8s)]
*  Forgive non angelinos san vicente boulevard. It's a you know main thoroughfare in west la [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=29.279999999999998s)]
*  And as I was driving up san vicente the entire other side was closed and was just all emergency vehicles [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  I hadn't seen anything like that since 9 11 when I was in new york. There were like dozens of emergency vehicles [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=41.04s)]
*  And that's when I came in here [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=45.76s)]
*  And then when I drove home [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  They had like closed off i-10 where it goes down to the pacific coast highway [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=49.44s)]
*  And I could see the fire. I mean not just smoke I could see like flames right and we lost power that night [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=54.56s)]
*  You guys lost power early and for a long time [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=62.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was well [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=64.0s)]
*  Is that crazy night with the for what folks on there was like a hundred mile per hour gusts of wind in some parts [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=64.80000000000001s)]
*  Of the city and everywhere else was just really really windy and scary ominous windy we had [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=68.80000000000001s)]
*  Uh, we had wind so strong that a tree and like a real tree not like a small guy [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  Um fell over our front yard [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=78.88s)]
*  But we were never you know [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=81.44s)]
*  like you we were safe distance in the sense that there's like three miles of concrete between us and [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=82.8s)]
*  the palisades but man just [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=88.32s)]
*  a totally tragic and surreal [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=91.44s)]
*  Few days here horrifying and and it's just we're at the beginning of this thing [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=94.24s)]
*  I mean if we're talking tuesday afternoon june 14th, there's going to be bad winds tonight. Hopefully then things calm down [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=97.84s)]
*  Uh going to the weekend and what we really need is some rain or for the winds to shift from blowing inland to offshore [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=104.56s)]
*  To blowing in free, you know blowing from uh over the coast in so we get some moisture in here [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=111.19999999999999s)]
*  But I mean hannah and I we're we're completely safe. We're fine, but on wednesday night. Um [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=115.92s)]
*  we're watching tv about to put our kids down and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  The local news starts showing the hollywood hills fire. Well, that was yeah, that was the the that fire was a weird one, too [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  I I don't know if they figured out how that started don't know how it started [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=130.96s)]
*  They they got it out fast [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  I think because they had the air assets available and they started dumping water on it from helicopters and planes, etc [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=135.68s)]
*  But when we saw that hannah and I said we're getting out of here just because those hills are uncomfortably close [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=141.12s)]
*  Yeah, and hannah thought that we might have been evacuated and so we just like threw everything [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=146.16s)]
*  We also got I mean, I will say like nine false [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=149.84s)]
*  I do want to say that la response has been far better than [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  I mean, I mean we can i'm not even talking about caron bass i'm talking about these firefighters. They're incredible [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=156.72s)]
*  I mean, I have a bunch of friends on manderville canyon road [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=161.04s)]
*  And it for you know, the fire basically started to come up the ridge to this road and they just stopped it [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=164.8s)]
*  I mean with air drops with brush clearing with fire retardant [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=169.36s)]
*  I mean heroic heroic work, but the people that fucked up are the people that sent [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=173.60000000000002s)]
*  Emergency warnings telling us all to evacuate because I got like 4am. Yeah, I got an evacuation warning [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=179.82000000000002s)]
*  I'm like this can't be right. I mean i'm looking out my window. I don't see a fire, you know [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=184.56s)]
*  But anyway, that's uh, that's the least of the problems. Absolutely terrifying. Hopefully, uh [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=189.44s)]
*  This thing is is [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=194.08s)]
*  Well under control [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=195.92s)]
*  Soon, um, that doesn't mean but there's going to be an enormous need for a very long time [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=197.44s)]
*  If you want to help out [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=201.36s)]
*  We set up a way for folks to donate if they want to a bunch of great organizations [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=202.64s)]
*  You can go to the latino community foundation the los angeles regional food bank [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=207.68s)]

*  act blue through this this um [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=224.64000000000001s)]
*  The setup because most of our listeners have all their information saved and it just kind of reduces friction and you can donate easily [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=226.72s)]
*  Uh, we raised about a hundred thousand dollars for those groups super grateful to the people for their generosity [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=232.16s)]
*  but uh, man, I mean ben and I were just talking on the way and like [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=237.76000000000002s)]
*  It's it's going to be a question of not can you rebuild a lot of these parts of the city? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=242.0s)]
*  But do people want to live there in anytime soon pacific palisades is kind of gone, you know [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=246.0s)]

*  Yeah, I don't even know what it looks like to rebuild an entire neighborhood like that, you know thousands and thousands of houses [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=257.12s)]
*  I will say my one, you know, uh [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=262.08s)]
*  Lib comment here i'm going to make but you know for years like this it's interesting to live in a place [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=264.88s)]
*  where the climate effects are so obvious because [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=271.44s)]
*  To shorthand this in 30 seconds [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=275.12s)]
*  It's been raining much more here the last few years [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=277.76s)]
*  Which means much more vegetation and then it gets hotter and drier in the summer, which means that more vegetation burns faster [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=280.96000000000004s)]
*  You know, you don't have to be climate scientists understand that we have a problem here [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  And so there are places where it might have been safe to live [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  Like, you know 30 years ago that people are going to think about [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=296.08s)]
*  Um, how to rebuild if to rebuild yeah, and how we're just going to manage going forward knowing this stuff's going to happen [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=299.76s)]
*  Yeah, um our buddy peter hamby is a great piece in puck that I think really well encapsulates kind of the history [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=305.68s)]
*  Of fires in the ally area like yes, it's absolutely being exacerbated by climate change [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=311.52s)]
*  But you had horrible fires in the 90s. Oh, yeah, the same questions the same political recriminations people, you know [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=315.68s)]

*  Your predecessor in a trump administration secretary esper was asked and did use uniform military [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=481.36s)]

*  Helos flew low in washington dc as crowd control [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=493.2s)]
*  He later apologized publicly for those actions. Was he right or wrong to apologize senator? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=496.96s)]
*  I was there on the ground and I saw that I saw I understand and I respect that i've been there [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=503.28s)]
*  I understand the level of threat of defense involved in that moment [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=507.52s)]
*  I also understand so he was legality and the constitution was he right or wrong to apologize? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=511.92s)]
*  I'm not going to put words in the mouth of secretary esper or anybody else. He said them himself [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=518.64s)]
*  You don't have to what are you scared of? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=523.28s)]
*  Did he do the right thing by apologizing? I'm not scared of anything senator and say yes or no [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=525.36s)]
*  You can say no the laws in the constitution. Okay, are we going to abide by the by the geneva convention and the prohibitions on torture? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=531.28s)]
*  Or are we not is it going to senator as I've said as i've stated multiple times the geneva conventions are what we base ours [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=538.0s)]
*  But what an america first national security policy is not going to do [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=544.64s)]
*  Is hand its prerogatives over to international bodies that make decisions about how our men and women make decisions on the battlefield [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=548.96s)]
*  America first understands we send americans for a clear mission and a clear objective. We [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=556.64s)]
*  Equip them properly for that objective [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=562.24s)]
*  All right, we give everything they need and then we stand behind them [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=564.64s)]
*  With the rules of engagement that allow them to fight decisively i understand america's enemies [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=568.8s)]
*  So you heard alissa slotkin senator from michigan and angus king senator from maine. I thought alissa slotkin [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=574.08s)]
*  I didn't watch the whole hearing. I watched a lot of it. I thought uh slotkin was really good [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=579.0400000000001s)]
*  Both in in uh, substantive tone of her question. She's been good on that committee. Yes [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=583.0400000000001s)]
*  She is and she has a lot of relevant experience. You can't get by her [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=586.96s)]
*  There were also been a lot of questions about hexeth's drinking [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=590.32s)]
*  From I reminded the word a great word biblis which means like a in a state of near constant drunkenness [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=593.6800000000001s)]
*  That's what I loved and stuck with me a long time ago [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=598.88s)]
*  In college yeah his uh infidelity, uh, you know, there's allegations that have tanked previous nominees for senior positions [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=601.28s)]
*  Um, but republicans don't seem to really care about that stuff anymore [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=610.56s)]
*  So we're going to focus on pete's responses to policy questions because it seems like he's going to get the job [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=613.76s)]
*  So ben I came away thinking that hexeth does not believe that women should serve in combat [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=618.0s)]
*  He doesn't seem particularly committed to the geneva conventions or the rule of law [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=623.36s)]
*  We know in the past he's lobbied trump, uh to pardon service members who commit war crimes [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=627.7600000000001s)]
*  He also would not rule out ordering the military to shoot american protesters if donald trump asked him to you heard elissa slotkin ask him about that [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=632.5600000000001s)]
*  He's going to give an unlimited support to the israeli military to use in gaza [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=639.84s)]
*  He is basically just a vessel for whatever trump wants or says with no really relevant experience [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=643.5200000000001s)]
*  But I did I leave anything out any other takeaways from you? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=649.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so I have a piece in the new york times today that people want to check it out about about very good piece [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=652.88s)]
*  But and the basic point is to understand hexeth [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=658.24s)]
*  I think you have to understand what's happened on the right [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=662.5600000000001s)]
*  Really the far right but it's now the right I guess since 9 11 where a guy like hexeth, you know after 9 11 [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=665.52s)]
*  It's rah rah rah. We're going to go win these great victories in iraq and afghanistan [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=672.32s)]
*  Those turn out to be terrible decisions [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=675.84s)]
*  Those people feel somewhat betrayed by the bushes and Chinese of the world [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=678.24s)]
*  and then they do the thing that happens a lot when superpowers don't win wars they instead of kind of [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=682.72s)]
*  Really focusing on the failed foreign policy. They kind of start blaming enemies within the united states [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=688.96s)]
*  You know the liberals the muslims the immigrants fifth column the woke culture fifth column stuff [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=694.32s)]
*  You know, and that's pete hexeth, right? He's basically he went [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=700.4s)]
*  Yeah, he went from cheerleading the iraq war to castigating world culture [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=704.1600000000001s)]
*  But I think that the thing that is dangerous and some of that's an eclipse is to just you know [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=708.5600000000001s)]
*  He is actually arguing for a fundamental transformation in the u.s military [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=714.0s)]
*  We would no longer abide by international law in the geneva convention, you know [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=718.72s)]
*  He advocated the the pardon of people that murdered civilians. I mean, this is not [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=722.48s)]
*  You know close stuff. These are people that were actually prosecuted [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=727.36s)]
*  Yeah, these weren't edge cases these weren't violations of the rules of engagement [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=730.48s)]
*  These are pretty clear-cut war crimes clear-cut war crimes, right? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=733.6s)]
*  Um at a time when trump is threatening to violate other international laws by maybe like invading greenland, which you gotta ask about [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=736.48s)]
*  Yeah, yeah that too is concerning. You know, how does it the hostility international law go in that direction? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=742.48s)]
*  The kind of reverse social engineering of the military, you know, we don't like gays in military [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=748.4s)]
*  We don't like women in combat [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=752.72s)]
*  We don't like so-called diversity hires including the currently black chairman of the joint chiefs of staff [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=754.0799999999999s)]
*  you know and then this question that alissa focused on which is [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=760.08s)]
*  Will the united states military just become not only like a kind of magga military like it's part of donald trump's [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=763.92s)]
*  Social engineering but will be used in the united states to serve the president's political interests to quash [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=770.32s)]
*  Protests as trump wanted to do after george floyd. She also asked if uh, uh, hegseth would ask uniform military [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=775.42s)]
*  Members to staff migrant detention facilities on the border or sounds like yes or engage in mass deportations, right? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=782.24s)]
*  so this is very serious stuff and [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=788.88s)]
*  It is just worth pausing on the fact that it's absurd. He's going to be confirmed [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=792.64s)]
*  I mean putting aside the horrific sexual assault allegations [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=795.92s)]
*  And drinking allegations just the fact that a fox and friends weekend anchor, you know, who's going to be there is crazy [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=800.64s)]
*  um, but uh the [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=808.3199999999999s)]
*  The democrats, you know some of them I I think were the people that were focused on what he's going to do [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=811.68s)]
*  I think have the right approach one thing we just talked about is like what's the democratic approach and resistance 2.0 [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=817.6s)]
*  Focus on what they say they want to do [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=822.72s)]
*  You know yelling at him about his drinking or his infidelities. I don't like those things [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=825.36s)]
*  But like donald trump is the president. I think we I think we've you know crossed the barrier of [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=828.3199999999999s)]
*  Infidelity being disqualified for high office when the president i'd say just literally convicted [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=833.66s)]
*  And sentenced a few days ago for paying hush money to a porn star [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=838.4s)]
*  Yeah, one might argue also, uh when bill clinton was elected twice, that's fair. That's fair [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=841.6s)]
*  People care that much about that. Yeah, I I when I turned on the hearing for the first time [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=845.92s)]
*  It was tim cain senator tim cain shouting about infidelity and it just it felt so off and it was so wrong [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=849.76s)]
*  Tammy duckworth tried to burn [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=856.24s)]
*  Pete for not knowing what countries were in ozzy on i'm not sure that was that probably endears pete hexa to his support [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=858.24s)]
*  Because it's like fuck ozzy on you know, I love by the way, I say that love nobody loves ozzy on [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=864.88s)]
*  I would never question you but here was a slightly less effective line of questioning then for senator jack reed [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=870.24s)]
*  I thought people might enjoy well, by the way, would you explain what a jag off is? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=874.88s)]
*  oh [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=879.84s)]
*  I don't think I need to sir [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=881.2s)]
*  Why not? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=883.36s)]
*  Because the men and women watching understand [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=884.64s)]
*  Well, perhaps some of my colleagues don't understand [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=887.6s)]
*  It would be a jag officer who puts [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=891.2s)]
*  His or her own priorities in front of the warfighters [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=894.0s)]
*  Their promotions their medals in front of having the backs of those who are making the tough calls on the front lines [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=896.96s)]
*  Thank you, sir. Interesting. What about that exchange was damaging to pete hexa? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=902.72s)]
*  That's a huge win for pete hexa [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=907.9200000000001s)]
*  In that exchange. Oh, it's just terrible [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=910.24s)]
*  It's just it's just a fundamental misreading of the room the room being america to think that you're you know [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=912.4000000000001s)]
*  Winning that exchange or the u.s military like that clip will probably go around to a bunch of service members [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=918.1600000000001s)]
*  We'll think it's fucking hilarious that he's making fun of jag officers and call him jag. Yeah, it's not the way to go [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=922.5600000000001s)]
*  I mean [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=927.36s)]
*  We should point out that pete hexeth has also written constantly about the [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=927.92s)]
*  existential threat to america of a marxist leftist ideology and [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=932.3s)]
*  Has called for the categorical defeat of the left in this country. So that guy running the united states military is [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=936.24s)]
*  Maybe not the best thing for crooked media. You know, I don't know pretty bad for everybody [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=942.4s)]
*  We're not marxist to be clear. No, um, but we are in the last even close [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=946.4799999999999s)]
*  Uh just to round out kind of updates from the team marco rubio [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=950.0799999999999s)]
*  Has his confirmation hearing on wednesday [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=954.3199999999999s)]
*  Uh the day this episode comes out it sounds like he's issuing for confirmation rubio [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=956.8s)]
*  Um the nominees that were seen as wobbly in terms of the from the national security side of the of the nominations front [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=960.64s)]
*  Uh, it's also gabbered to be director of national intelligence cash with hell to be fbi director [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=966.8s)]
*  Those are no longer seen as wobbly by the kind of mainstream press [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=971.12s)]
*  Uh, it sounds like they will make it through barring some other revelation or disaster at their confirmation hearings [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=974.88s)]
*  But then before we move on I did just quickly want to check in with you on what? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=981.68s)]
*  Uh trump 1.0 team is up to you. This is a clip [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=986.4s)]
*  Uh trump's first national security advisor mike flinn on some random right-wing podcasts called the mel k show [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=990.0799999999999s)]
*  Uh, let's hear from general flinn. I mean there were people while trump was serving [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=996.8s)]
*  As president that were in his administration that we now know committed treason hundred they undermine they undermined [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1001.4399999999999s)]
*  The sitting president of the united states while they were working for him [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1008.8s)]
*  And they were in the executive branch of the government that's called treason [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1012.16s)]
*  So there some of them are over in the cia some are in the national security council, so [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1015.6s)]
*  There are going to have to be [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1021.4399999999999s)]
*  You know, it's [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1023.8399999999999s)]
*  I mean, I hate to use the phrase the night of the long knives [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1025.12s)]
*  But because that's a really bad bad phrase, but there there has to be a reckoning, right? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1027.52s)]
*  For those unfamiliar the night of the long knives was a major political purge ordered by hitler in 1934 [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1032.96s)]
*  Where he ordered the execution of rivals and political opponents [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1039.04s)]
*  Ben is it normal to suggest that your old boss should emulate hitler? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1042.48s)]

*  And if you want more evidence [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1424.88s)]
*  Seriously weaken iran and russia [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1426.96s)]
*  Just take a look at syria. There is nothing [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1429.28s)]
*  I can tell you from my conversation both shi and pudin [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1432.24s)]
*  Nothing our adversaries and competitors [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1435.68s)]
*  Like russia and china would have liked more [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1438.16s)]
*  Than seeing us to continue to be tied down in afghanistan for another decade [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1440.72s)]
*  For all those reasons [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1445.76s)]
*  Ending the war was the right thing to do [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1447.6000000000001s)]
*  And I believe history will reflect that it's a lot of different pieces there ben [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1450.8799999999999s)]
*  Uh, we talked about this a bit on pots of america tuesday, so i'll just be brief [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1454.24s)]
*  I mean, I think what I found lacking in the speech, uh, or or less effective was it was kind of a litany of accomplishments [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1457.36s)]
*  That didn't really at times match up with the reality of this uncertain moment that we're in [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1464.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah this moment of peril that we just talked about with mike flinn like yes, we created new partnerships in asia [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1470.32s)]
*  But what happens to them now and also by the way, I mean some of those partnerships and alliances like south korea are a [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1475.84s)]
*  Little rocky at the moment. Um, yes, it's great that biden went to kiev and putin is not [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1481.36s)]
*  But what happens to ukraine now? Yeah. Yes iran is weaker [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1488.1599999999999s)]
*  But they are closer than ever to getting a nuclear weapon [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1491.52s)]
*  So like you give it your best shot in these speeches [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1494.08s)]
*  You're trying your best to kind of lay down the first draft of history and your legacy and your accomplishments [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1496.4799999999998s)]
*  And and on one score like part of the speech I do give president biden a lot of credit for ending the war in afghanistan [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1501.78s)]
*  It's interesting that he's now highlighting that as an accomplishment when they didn't really talk about it for a very long time because it was [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1507.54s)]
*  Seen as a liability. Um, but you know some of the stuff in there about like [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1512.9s)]
*  Urging trump to keep in place his ai policy or his climate work [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1518.74s)]
*  Like it just it seems very unlikely and then gaza was kind of an afterthought we can get to that in a second [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1522.9s)]
*  But like what were your big picture thoughts on this? Yeah, well, let's do gaza, you know next [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1528.74s)]
*  Um, I think you put it well [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1533.46s)]
*  You know listening to that even just now and this we should note. This is the last pod say the world of the biden administration [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1535.94s)]
*  um, so uh [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1540.66s)]
*  It's not unlike, you know the domestic piece in which [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1543.7s)]
*  They have a communications and I and I don't think this is on the communication staffers [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1548.3400000000001s)]
*  I think this is from joe biden himself to be very clear [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1552.3400000000001s)]
*  They have a communication strategy that's constantly telling you about all these historic achievements [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1555.46s)]
*  And so on domestic policy, I would watch this and he's constantly, you know [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1561.22s)]
*  I passed this and that and nobody's done as much since fdr and and and a lot of those accomplishments are real and important [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1564.8999999999999s)]
*  but you know what like the cost of living sucks and [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1572.5s)]
*  The infrastructure bill is that's it's not the new deal. It's it can be good without being the greatest thing ever, you know [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1576.5s)]
*  And it's interesting that they do the same thing on foreign policy and all these legacy tours because [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1582.9s)]
*  Sure, there are good things that they've done and if I go through the list, uh [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1587.78s)]
*  That you know, sure they they kind of restored good relations with our allies [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1592.02s)]
*  They at the critical moment with ukraine kind of helped ukraine survive [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1596.82s)]
*  And have a fighting chance and literally that's all it is in this war with russia [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1601.54s)]
*  I think they've done a lot of interesting things vis-a-vis china [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1605.94s)]
*  Whether it's kind of restricting technology to give the united states an advantage whether it's kind of building this network of alliances in the asia-pacific [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1608.9s)]
*  Also kind of stabilizing the relationship with china in the last year or two [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1616.02s)]
*  I got that fucking spy balloon got shot down that fucking balloon [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1619.7s)]
*  You know rejoin paris and they you know, they're good things huge climate investment. Yeah, huge massive climate investments [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1623.54s)]
*  but because they over torque it so much, you know that it's like [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1630.74s)]
*  to your point like ukraine [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1635.8600000000001s)]
*  Is is not they talk about it like it's some war that is over that was won and [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1638.1799999999998s)]
*  And it's not it's still a very difficult circumstance. And also we're not the main actor [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1643.62s)]
*  I'm more interested that zelensky stood in keve than joe biden to be honest, you know, and [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1648.26s)]
*  on afghanistan [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1653.9399999999998s)]
*  They'd have more credibility [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1655.4599999999998s)]
*  In defending the withdrawal if they acknowledged that the withdrawal didn't go well. I know that part's frustrating and joe biden has never once said [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1657.54s)]
*  That he has any regret about how that went went down, you know, and if he just said [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1665.6200000000001s)]
*  You know, I believe was the right thing to do. I believe we had to leave afghanistan at some point [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1669.78s)]
*  I didn't want to leave this to another successor [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1673.94s)]
*  But you know, we wish that it was less chaotic [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1676.5s)]
*  We are heartbroken at the loss of life of afghans and americans [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1679.7s)]
*  And and and we continue to care about afghan women and people that are suffering under the taliban [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1684.18s)]
*  the inability to [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1690.66s)]
*  just [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1692.9s)]
*  Describe what everybody is seeing in the world because no nobody is going to only believe that speech [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1693.86s)]
*  Because we're still looking at the world in which there's a war in ukraine in which there's a lot of unnerving [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1699.62s)]
*  Conflict in which the middle east is a mess and you know, we'll talk about that [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1705.3s)]
*  so I just it's a lesson in in the last thing i'd say on alliances, which they keep coming back to it [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1709.4599999999998s)]
*  Alliances are a means to an end. They're not an end. I mean the fact that we get along with countries. We should get along with [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1715.54s)]
*  Is not that's great, but you know, where what do you want to do with that, you know? [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1721.94s)]
*  and and and what is trump going to do with that and and so I I just think that [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1726.74s)]
*  um, there was just it was so off the [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1731.22s)]
*  While there's a lot of substance in there that is right [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1734.98s)]
*  And and we know a lot of people in this administration by the way who worked their ass off for four years [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1737.78s)]
*  And and i'm talking about even down people of mid-level people. These are not necessarily [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1743.06s)]
*  Even just you know, these are not the people negotiating in gaza, you know [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1747.22s)]
*  I'm talking about people that went to work in a pandemic and are leaving with donald trump coming in probably had a pretty tough [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1750.66s)]
*  Four years and worked hard but but this victory lap just felt [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1755.7s)]
*  Kind of totally like who's it for? Yeah. Yeah. No, I don't know. It seemed like it was for [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1761.14s)]
*  To be blunt joe biden. Yeah, he wants to kind of like lay down what his what he thinks his record is and what it should look [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1766.42s)]
*  Like and yeah [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1772.02s)]
*  And I think he would be better served at least taking on board listening to giving an inch on some of the it'd be more effective [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1772.8200000000002s)]
*  Communication strategy they'd have a better chance at communicating a positive legacy if they acknowledge some error or some unease [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1779.22s)]
*  Yeah for sure. Um, uh, we reference the gaza piece. So here's a clip of president biden talking about gaza palestinians [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1786.9s)]
*  Who suffered terribly in this war? [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1793.8600000000001s)]
*  That hamas started [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1796.1000000000001s)]
*  They've been through hell [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1798.18s)]
*  So many innocent people have been killed [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1800.5s)]
*  So many communities have been destroyed [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1802.98s)]
*  The palestinian people deserve peace [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1806.26s)]
*  And the right to determine their own futures [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1809.46s)]
*  Israel deserves peace [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1812.42s)]
*  and real security [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1814.34s)]
*  And the hostages of their families deserve to be reunited [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1816.42s)]
*  And so we're working urgently to close this deal [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1821.54s)]
*  So ben this this was the part of the speech that [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1825.6200000000001s)]
*  Frustrated me the most which is totally the most off [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1827.92s)]
*  I think the biden administration a lot of senior officials often talk about gaza and palestinian suffering in the passive voice [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1830.02s)]
*  Is if we are not a party to this conflict when we're giving all of the weapons to the israelis [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1835.94s)]
*  And and I know that president biden is desperately trying to get another ceasefire deal [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1840.18s)]
*  And there were a bunch of reports and rumors this morning that a deal was imminent [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1845.3s)]
*  Uh and about to get done, but you know, nothing was finalized by the time we started recording at what's 2 43 pm pacific right now [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1849.22s)]
*  Um, but even the deal that's being discussed will not end the war and you know [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1856.26s)]
*  It was like ruling out ending the war and now the reconstruction effort is going to get handed off to donald trump [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1860.3400000000001s)]
*  Who does not give a shit about the palestinians? Yeah, so it is it is incredibly bleak [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1864.98s)]
*  We're the reason it got to this point because we've been arming one side of the conflict and doing nothing to [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1870.26s)]
*  End it in my view. Yeah, I mean it's been 15 months since october 7th [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1876.82s)]
*  Every single plane that has dropped a bomb on gaza is an american plane [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1882.02s)]
*  The 2 000 pound bombs dropped on refugee camps or american 2 000 pound bombs [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1886.5s)]
*  The united states has vetoed resolutions [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1891.94s)]
*  That tried to create bring about a ceasefire at the un security council [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1894.74s)]
*  And we could go on and on the the the bottom line is that joe biden used absolutely no leverage to try to end the war [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1898.5s)]
*  In gaza and it sounds like the trump administration without even taking office is using more leverage [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1904.5s)]
*  Or at least playing a little more hardball than yahoo according to news reports [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1909.5400000000002s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean according to news reports, you know trump has clearly made it made it known [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1913.0600000000002s)]
*  That he wanted this war [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1918.26s)]
*  Over by the time he took office and he said that publicly and he said i've heard from many people [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1920.34s)]
*  In the u.s. Government and in foreign governments that that's the message from trump since the election [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1926.5s)]
*  And if you look at reports, you know [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1931.3799999999999s)]
*  Steve witkoff who you know, none of us had heard of two months ago was harder on netanyahu than anybody in the biden administration [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1933.94s)]
*  Like let's just be blunt about it. You know, if those reports are true, yeah, I don't know [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1940.5s)]
*  Um, and and let's be clear too. That's not because donald trump is two fucks about the palestinians [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1944.42s)]
*  That's because he wants to probably humiliate joe biden, you know [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1949.16s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder if you're trying to actually jimmy carter and which was you know, ronald reagan takes office and hours later [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1952.76s)]
*  The house just get out of iran. He wants this kind of off the the plate when he comes in [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1957.64s)]
*  He wants it out of the news [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1961.5600000000002s)]
*  but you know [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1963.0s)]
*  That I see some people are like see donald trump's better for the palestinians [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1964.52s)]
*  Let's wait and see what happens in the west bank [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1968.8400000000001s)]
*  Because the west bank is actually the thing that i've been most concerned with trump is [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1970.44s)]
*  Is whether he'll just look their way to kind of de facto if not outright annexation there [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1974.28s)]
*  But look, there's no way getting around the fact that I know they you can tell in all the the legacy stuff [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1978.52s)]
*  They don't want to be defined by gaza [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1983.1599999999999s)]
*  But this is the thing that has happened that's the most prominent thing that's happened for the last year and a half [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1984.52s)]
*  And it's it's a huge part of this legacy [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1989.48s)]
*  And they the all the language passive voice about palestinian suffering [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1992.6s)]
*  Um, there was not really any action [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=1998.2s)]
*  You know, I mean I get [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2001.1599999999999s)]
*  Tony blinkin's [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2003.24s)]
*  Argument is it well, it could have been worse. Well, you know, I guess [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2004.52s)]
*  But it was pretty fucking close to the worst. You know, not that much worse [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2007.48s)]
*  Biden also made a couple policy announcement announcements on the foreign policy front that we just want to quickly mention [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2012.1200000000001s)]
*  On tuesday the ap reported that biden is planning to lift the designation of cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2016.8400000000001s)]
*  Ben, can you just give us the quick explanation of how big a deal that is? [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2023.24s)]
*  And a time estimate for how long it will take marco rubio to walk it right back. So I you know, I [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2026.68s)]
*  I love this move. I've argued for this move for years [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2033.0800000000002s)]
*  but just to [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2036.52s)]
*  This is a really powerful sanction because when you're on the state sponsor of terrorism list [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2038.04s)]
*  You're basically cut off from the international financial system [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2042.36s)]
*  I mean the risk of anybody doing any business in cuba is through the roof because of this level of sanction [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2045.08s)]
*  Obama removed them from the state sponsor of terrorism [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2052.52s)]
*  List as a part of the normalization process [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2055.72s)]
*  I want to add as some person who negotiated that cuba was not a state sponsor of terrorism [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2059.56s)]
*  So it wasn't like a gift. It was actually just an acknowledgement of reality. They were on this list for wholly political purposes [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2064.8399999999997s)]
*  Obama removes them from the list things start to get better in the lives of the cuban people [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2071.7999999999997s)]
*  There's more travel down there. There's more resources down there. There's more internet connectivity down there [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2075.64s)]
*  Mike pompeo at about this time the trump administration in january of 2021 [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2081.0s)]
*  Slaps them back on the list going out the door [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2086.36s)]
*  Cuba has been in an acute humanitarian crisis that we've talked about [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2089.72s)]
*  Look, this is a hugely positive step [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2093.64s)]
*  But the fact that they're doing it now makes you wonder why they didn't do it [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2096.7599999999998s)]
*  One year two years three years or four years ago because cuba is not a state sponsor of terrorism [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2099.56s)]
*  So I I mean i'm glad they did it. I kind of begs the question of what's different now [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2103.3199999999997s)]
*  Cuba was no more a state sponsor of terrorism in any other day of the administration than today [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2108.04s)]
*  And yeah, the risk is that marco rubio who's you know, uh made a kind of political identity out of being a hawk on cuba [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2113.0s)]
*  May come in and just throw them back on that list. So we'll see that happening [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2119.64s)]
*  The other immigration specific thing biden announced was [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2122.92s)]
*  The department of homeland security announced an extension of temporary protected status for immigrants from venezuela ukraine sudan and el salvador [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2126.8399999999997s)]
*  So that will protect 937 000 people from deportation for 18 months the thing that's obviously great [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2133.96s)]
*  Because sending someone back to you know, sudan right now is is unconscionable sadistic but uh trump has previously said he'd revoke [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2141.48s)]
*  Tps status for certain groups. So it's just not clear to me how settled this is or if they could also walk this one back [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2149.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I you know this begs, you know the question of there'll be legal challenges. I'm sure but [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2155.3999999999996s)]
*  um, I [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2161.3999999999996s)]
*  Badly needed step, but this is the same situation that was faced by the haitians [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2163.0s)]
*  um in the infamous dogs and cats, uh episode because [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2167.56s)]
*  The reason those people are legal is because of tps [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2171.56s)]
*  But the reason that trump and jd vance argued that they weren't legal is that they intended to revoke that status [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2173.64s)]
*  and so [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2178.84s)]
*  Expect to see a lot of drama [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2179.88s)]
*  Tragically around whether people are here on temporary protected status can stay [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2183.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and then one last immigration thing that caught our eye that we want to mention before we move on [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2188.2000000000003s)]
*  Republicans are pushing legislation in congress right now called the laken riley bill [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2192.1200000000003s)]
*  It is named after a nursing student in georgia who was brutally murdered by an undocumented immigrant. It became a huge [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2195.6400000000003s)]
*  Sort of right-wing cause during the campaign [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2202.28s)]
*  The bill would do a bunch of different things including require federal authorities to detain undocumented migrants suspected of [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2204.28s)]
*  Theft of over a hundred dollars or more and do so without trial [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2210.84s)]
*  So basically petty theft will get you thrown in jail indefinitely, which is very strange and unconstitutional seeming [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2213.8s)]
*  but the one very surprising piece from a world perspective [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2219.96s)]
*  Is the bill lets states demand that the state department not issue visas to countries that refuse to take back migrants [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2223.6400000000003s)]
*  We deport which just seems completely unworkable to have like the state of oklahoma making foreign policy determinations [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2230.76s)]
*  For the federal government, but I don't know this bill is a classic case of a bill [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2237.8s)]
*  That was allegedly written to do a particular thing, which is deport criminals [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2242.92s)]
*  And yet was written so expansively [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2248.76s)]
*  As to basically do away with any due process as to kind of give the state of oklahoma foreign policy powers [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2251.88s)]
*  And democrats were so [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2259.08s)]
*  Intimidated by the election that far too many of them went along with it, you know [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2261.14s)]
*  Check out andy k malissa slock and two friends of ours [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2265.48s)]
*  Now in the senate, you know who took principle to stand on this the one thing i'd add from a world perspective [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2269.4s)]
*  Is this is actually not new [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2274.04s)]
*  It's out of a far-right playbook that we've seen in europe. So there have been efforts in europe to use things like, you know [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2276.12s)]
*  traffic violations get people deported, you know, um [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2282.12s)]
*  It goes far beyond the kind of stated intent of deporting criminals [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2285.72s)]
*  It's basically can we find any you know, imagine if you were totally innocent and someone said that guy shoplifted [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2290.44s)]
*  And this person's innocent and suddenly they're getting deported under the laken riley act. I mean, that's not great. No, that's terrible [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2297.08s)]
*  Well another one to watch because immigration will be uh something that moves fast. I think in this next administration [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2302.52s)]
*  Um, so ben, you know one of the big challenges that trump is going to face [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2308.04s)]
*  As soon as he takes over is the future of syria assuming he cares [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2311.24s)]
*  Um over the weekend there was a big conference in saudi arabia with reps from across the middle east in the west including the eu's [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2315.0s)]
*  Top diplomat kai akalas as well as syria's new foreign minister at that conference saudi arabia called for getting rid of sanctions on syria [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2321.08s)]
*  With the saudi foreign minister saying quote their continuation hinders the aspirations of the syrian people to achieve development and reconstruction [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2328.04s)]
*  So pretty clear there and then in europe, uh france germany spain the netherlands sandmark and finland [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2334.7599999999998s)]
*  All released a paper saying the eu should immediately begin adjusting their sanctions regime [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2340.04s)]
*  While at the same time keeping a close eye on the human rights situation in syria if certain conditions are not met [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2345.0s)]
*  They propose sort of snapback mechanisms to put sanctions back in place [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2350.8399999999997s)]
*  But you know, it's interesting that as syria tries to rebuild [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2354.7599999999998s)]
*  Uh, there are these european and saudi pressures, you know pushing in the in the direction of sanctions relief [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2357.72s)]
*  There's also this question of how to hold the asad regime accountable [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2363.56s)]
*  Especially given the fact that so many of its senior leaders have fled we caught up with ismail al-adula [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2368.06s)]
*  He's a member of the white helmets based in aleppo [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2373.66s)]
*  We just wanted to hear what he had to say about what ordinary syrians want to see happen next from their government [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2376.4599999999996s)]
*  most of the west or the west audience are talking about who will [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2382.22s)]
*  lead syria or who will [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2386.7s)]
*  run syria and this guy or this guy and [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2389.4199999999996s)]
*  for syrian people this is [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2392.8599999999997s)]
*  Not their priority their priority [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2395.1800000000003s)]
*  To get back to their homes [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2398.6200000000003s)]
*  Have normal life [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2401.1s)]
*  and [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2402.94s)]
*  I can say on behalf of most of the syrians. We don't need a president right now for five six years [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2404.2200000000003s)]
*  We don't need president [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2411.6600000000003s)]
*  we need [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2413.42s)]
*  To get normal with to our life to normalcy to [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2414.94s)]
*  To live again to go we need our children to go to school their schools good school good education [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2419.34s)]
*  We need to rehabilitate everything we need a government to represent everyone [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2426.22s)]
*  election [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2432.12s)]
*  But maybe this after one year two years three years four years, maybe [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2433.42s)]
*  And we're not in hurry to get a new president [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2438.46s)]
*  We have president since [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2442.86s)]
*  Uh 50 years [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2445.42s)]
*  So we can live without a president. We have we now maybe we are the most happiest [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2447.6600000000003s)]
*  Heavier people in the in the world and on last month [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2453.34s)]
*  Without president without anything we're living we're building syria people are in the streets [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2457.98s)]
*  Clearing the streets and moving the trash [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2463.1s)]
*  Helping each other some good context from the ground about what actually matters to people [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2466.38s)]
*  Yeah, um, but then on this sanctions question [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2470.62s)]
*  I mean [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2472.46s)]
*  Why do you think the saudis in these european countries are so much more forward-leaning than the biden administration when it comes to getting rid of sanctions? [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2472.62s)]
*  I just think that if you don't get rid of sanctions you have a much greater risk of [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2479.5s)]
*  instability [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2485.16s)]
*  Of different groups fighting because there's a lack of resources, right? And so if your concern is the stability of syria [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2486.46s)]
*  You actually want to get electricity in food in investment in so that the place can stabilize [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2493.58s)]
*  So that you don't have hds beginning to get turned on by these other groups that are armed [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2499.82s)]
*  And so if you're europe, I mean then let's face it. I mean, I'd like to think some of this is humanitarian [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2505.58s)]
*  I think it is but you also want a syria that people can go back to yeah [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2510.7000000000003s)]
*  They want to send back as I want so if you if you want people to return to syria, you need syria to be success [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2514.78s)]
*  Um saudi is very interesting to me. It's interesting to me that this conference was in saudi arabia because [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2520.7000000000003s)]
*  Saudi arabia and the uae were the least enthusiastic about what happened [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2525.66s)]
*  They didn't like asad they they hate iran, but they don't like islamis either [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2530.3799999999997s)]
*  And so the uae was apparently kind of the last holdout, you know in terms of trying to work with asad [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2535.02s)]
*  um, I think it was smart of the syrians to [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2540.7s)]
*  You know do this in saudi and frankly of the saudis, you know, we don't have much good to say but I mean [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2545.4199999999996s)]
*  Good to host this kind of gathering [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2551.66s)]
*  And I I just would like to see the u.s follow suit because these sanctions aren't really accomplishing anything [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2554.2999999999997s)]
*  People will argue that they're leverage [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2559.98s)]
*  To get hts and syrian leaders to be inclusive and and to protect minority rights [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2562.3799999999997s)]
*  But the european approach is the right one. You can snap all that back if they start, you know repressing minorities [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2567.8999999999996s)]
*  You can sanction them and the last thing I just want to reaffirm that we talked about a little bit is that [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2572.94s)]
*  Let's not make the standard perfection here like coming out of the asad regime and the traumas of war [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2577.18s)]
*  this place is not going to look like a [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2582.4599999999996s)]
*  You know a paragon of democracy in six months if it's better and than it was and and they're trying to do the right thing [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2585.02s)]
*  We shouldn't be holding them to like impossible standards either [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2593.02s)]
*  Yeah, that's what happens sometimes with this stuff for sure [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2595.98s)]
*  And I think I heard the german foreign minister talk about like the need for a peace dividend for the people of syria [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2598.14s)]
*  Like got to make life better for them post asad that has got to be the near-term [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2602.22s)]
*  Uh priority and the rest the democratic process is going to take some time writing a constitution. It's going to take some time [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2605.98s)]
*  Well, you heard that guy too. Like we we're not in a hurry to have a president down there [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2611.66s)]
*  I mean not to you know, it's a totally different comparison. You know, they've like I [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2615.98s)]
*  Be nice to not have a president here [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2621.5s)]
*  Like yeah, like i'll go pick up the trash, you know, right, right [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2623.74s)]
*  Well speaking of place that didn't have a president let's talk about neighboring lebanon for a bit [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2627.1s)]
*  They now have a president they now have a prime minister after two years of the caretaker governments [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2630.78s)]
*  You can get a lot done with the caretaker government or actually maybe not done. Yeah, uh, uh general joseph [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2634.86s)]
*  Awen is commander of the lebanese military and is required by lebanon's sectarian power-sharing agreement. He's a maronite christian [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2639.74s)]
*  He was elected in the second round of voting with 99 votes out of the 128 [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2646.2999999999997s)]
*  And will resign from his position as army chief to take on the job [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2650.7s)]
*  Uh, it was his job to then appoint a sunni muslim prime minister and he chose nawaf salam [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2654.2999999999997s)]
*  Whose job it is to now form a government for those who don't the lebanon has a very strict sectarian power-sharing set up [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2659.02s)]
*  Where the president has to be a maronite christian prime minister is a sunni muslim the speaker of parliament [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2664.8599999999997s)]
*  A shia muslim the list goes on and on and on. Um, salam is an interesting background. He's a former diplomat [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2669.74s)]
*  He's the current head of the un's international court of justice [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2674.4599999999996s)]
*  But the big thing to note in all of this is how weakened hesbullah seems to be [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2677.74s)]
*  After israel basically decapitated its entire leadership structure. Neither candidate was hesbullah's first choice [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2683.58s)]
*  Um awen even promised in a speech to parliament that he would quote monopolize the carrying of weapons [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2690.2999999999997s)]
*  Uh and quote to the lebanese state so an allusion to disarming hesbullah. Uh ben obviously it's a good thing that [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2695.98s)]
*  One lebanon now is a government too. It's a government that hesbullah doesn't like the thing i'm trying to figure out [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2703.34s)]
*  And maybe it's unknowable is whether this is a durable change or whether hesbullah [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2708.7s)]
*  And whether hesbullah is permanently weakened or whether they're just going to buy their time [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2713.8199999999997s)]
*  The iranians will slowly feed them money and weapons and it will just kind of reemerge [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2717.98s)]
*  That is the question [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2722.7s)]
*  I mean the headline from all these government formation moves in lebanon is the marginalization relatively of hesbullah [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2723.66s)]
*  um, and [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2730.62s)]
*  The you know breaking of the logjam in lebanese politics because of that marginalization of hesbullah together with what's happened in syria [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2732.2999999999997s)]
*  This is a massive shift in the levant, you know, and that's good. Um that said it's the middle east and [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2739.18s)]
*  Lebanon has massive problems. I mean the financial crisis doesn't begin to describe it. Yeah [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2745.34s)]
*  And so the question is can this government [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2750.86s)]
*  You know both can hesbullah regenerate but also can this government perform? [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2753.82s)]
*  Or else they're gonna be blamed in a year or two years, too. So another reason to try to have [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2757.5s)]
*  uh, the you know [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2762.86s)]
*  Europe in the middle east probably taking the lead and trying to help stabilize the lebanese economy [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2764.78s)]
*  Yeah, so those are some of the situations that trump's inheriting in middle east [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2769.26s)]
*  We want to talk a bit about the political situation in europe [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2773.02s)]
*  Uh that lays at the feet of the trump administration and kind of what that means to the world [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2776.7s)]
*  So we're going to start with croatia austria in germany and then kind of expand it out [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2780.3s)]
*  In croatia the current president. Uh, zoran milanovic was reelected in a landslide with 74 percent of the vote [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2785.66s)]
*  The quick and dirty on this guy is he's pro-russia anti-support for ukraine and a harsh critic of the european union [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2792.06s)]
*  Milanovic often gets compared to trump though. I think it's more like style than substance [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2798.86s)]
*  But the croatian presidency is not a it's a ceremonial job largely [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2802.94s)]
*  But I think his margin of victor victory 74 percent. I think gives you a pretty good sense of [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2807.82s)]
*  The the way the political winds are blowing in this [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2813.18s)]
*  European union nato country and that's something I think we should just clock [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2816.38s)]
*  And then in austria, it is increasingly likely that the government will shift dramatically to the far right [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2820.38s)]
*  Uh herbert kekel's freedom party got the most votes and last week kekel was given the chance to form a coalition [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2825.2599999999998s)]
*  And see if he can become the next chancellor of austria [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2830.86s)]
*  The freedom party is promised to ban islam expel migrants including ones who become austrian citizens, by the way [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2834.14s)]
*  Kekel likes to attack the eu [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2839.58s)]
*  He opposes support for ukraine and he wants to roll back policies to prevent climate change [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2841.42s)]
*  So he opposes everything everything I care about [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2845.5s)]
*  But even that like kind of policy list doesn't get at how extreme these guys are kekel has repeatedly used [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2849.66s)]
*  Nazi era slogans and language that he knows are nazi, you know, he knows what the dog whistle he's he's using here [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2855.74s)]
*  And the freedom party itself was founded in the 1950s by former members of the ss [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2861.82s)]
*  So there's nothing subtle about these guys. Yeah, and then finally ben germany has elections coming up on february 23rd [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2866.54s)]
*  Most political analysts believe that uh, friedrich mertz from the christian democratic [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2873.1s)]
*  Union or cdu merkel's party will win and go into coalition with the social democrats, but who knows [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2877.34s)]
*  Uh, these right-wing parties keep outperforming their polling and the afd the the far-right extremely far-right party in germany [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2884.14s)]
*  Is currently sitting at about 22 percent. Um, the afd platform is also super right-wing [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2890.7799999999997s)]
*  Deportation of asylum seekers exiting the euro leaving the paris climate accord so similar to austria [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2896.2799999999997s)]
*  But this is the political context for trump 2.0, right? We talked about this last week. Justin trudeau out [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2901.5s)]
*  Far-right austrians and germans in like that's not a good setup [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2907.5s)]
*  Yeah, the diehard world those who listen to the election series might remember [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2911.26s)]
*  Zach boschamp from vox was on on democracy [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2916.38s)]
*  And and I remember it's something stuck in my head because I asked him what would be the worst thing for democracy about a trump win [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2919.6600000000003s)]
*  and I had some answers in my head and he [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2924.86s)]
*  Said the afd in germany, which is actually not the first answer I had [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2927.26s)]
*  And his point was that trump's victory could kind of normalize the idea [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2931.6600000000003s)]
*  That is seemingly extremist right-wing politics can be in the mainstream. Yes [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2936.1400000000003s)]
*  And I think what I take away where there's differences between these three the commonality is [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2941.34s)]
*  People are just they're pissed off in europe in the same way that they're pissed off here [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2947.1000000000004s)]
*  There's a kind of anti-incumbency anti-establishment anti-institution anti-covid anti-vibe. Yeah post-covid [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2950.38s)]
*  Anti-migration vibe that is the predominant [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2957.4s)]
*  momentum in european politics right now [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2961.1600000000003s)]
*  Um, that's the first point there are different degrees the creation guy's kind of bit more of a personality [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2963.6600000000003s)]
*  Than like a deep ideologue and he's warringly, you know kind of seemingly pro-russian and anti-eu and stuff [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2969.44s)]
*  But you know, he has beef with the prime minister [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2976.6400000000003s)]
*  The austrians let's just be clear tommy [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2979.6000000000004s)]
*  You don't like nazis starting in austria, right? Um, this is finishing germany [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2982.8s)]
*  Yeah, nazism that begins in austria and then moves to germany has traditionally been a very bad thing [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2987.36s)]
*  um, and and it's [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2992.4s)]
*  I mean I was making a little bit light but to take it seriously like [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2994.6400000000003s)]
*  This is like, you know, the mask is off here. These guys are like super scary scary creepy far-right guys [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=2997.76s)]
*  Who've party built like they didn't come out of nowhere like they've been working their way to this [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3005.1200000000003s)]
*  And the risk of this jumping into germany through the afd [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3009.52s)]
*  Um and and making significant inroads in the election is scary [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3013.44s)]
*  I think what it also means is the eu is going to have a hell of a time [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3017.92s)]
*  I mean for those who don't follow the eu it's most major decisions are like [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3022.0s)]
*  Require a degree of unanimity. There's veto powers and things like that with hungary slavakia, you know, like [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3025.8399999999997s)]
*  when domino's potentially falling [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3032.56s)]
*  I think one of the things we're gonna have to watch the next few years and you and I were talking about this is that [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3034.48s)]
*  Some things are gonna have to be done by kind of collections of like-minded countries things like support for ukraine for instance [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3038.88s)]
*  You know the the the countries that are not going this route [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3044.08s)]
*  May need to find ways [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3047.92s)]
*  to do things collectively [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3050.0s)]
*  that are harder to do through the [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3052.3199999999997s)]
*  Institutions of the european union because you're going to see some fracturing and trump is probably going to accelerate that [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3054.96s)]
*  by his own personality [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3060.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and so like, you know [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3062.2400000000002s)]
*  Liberal minded leaders in europe are going to have to deal with donald trump and they're gonna have to deal with these right-wing parties [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3064.0s)]
*  In europe, but the other kind of grenade that america's just kind of rolling into the equation is elon musk [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3069.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, because he's become the biggest booster of the afd he's doing it mostly on twitter [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3075.04s)]
*  But he also wrote not bad we discussed him this last week [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3079.36s)]
*  But the new york times had a great piece where they wrote they reported that afd members [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3081.68s)]
*  Are getting such a big boost from elon musk on twitter on x that they have started tweeting in english and not german in [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3085.52s)]
*  Hopes of getting noticed by him [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3091.2s)]
*  Yeah, and last week elon musk did a twitter spaces chat with this afd leader who wants to be chancellor. Her name is alice vital [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3092.48s)]
*  During that conversation musk repeated his endorsement of the afd party and then he asked her a bunch of softball questions. I [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3099.2799999999997s)]
*  Sadly listened to some of this as I was like sitting in laguna having escaped my kids were taking a nap [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3106.4s)]
*  So what else would I do as one does the afd? [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3110.8s)]
*  um [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3114.0s)]
*  Very soon into this interview vital goes into this just absurd revisionist history about hitler and the nazis [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3114.88s)]
*  She was claiming that hitler was not right wing but was actually a communist and a socialist [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3121.28s)]
*  Um in case you're wondering that is nonsense [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3125.76s)]
*  Uh, it's literally the opposite hitler used the threat of communism to to get all the industrialists to finance his far-right politics [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3128.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, like hitler was an ultra nationalist. He was a fascist [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3134.5600000000004s)]
*  He threw leftist communist socialist into concentration camps and murdered them [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3137.44s)]
*  Dumb and or dishonest people often point to the full name of the nazi party the national socialist german workers party [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3142.4s)]
*  And claim the inclusion of the word socialist means [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3148.6400000000003s)]
*  That hitler was a lefty, but I would recommend you look at actions not words there actions like executing communists and then invading the soviet [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3151.52s)]
*  Yeah, and and purging social democrats and like literally [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3158.48s)]
*  Mobilizing like your support by fear mongering about the left, right? [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3162.06s)]
*  Right, but so elon's response to vital claiming that hitler was a leftist was quote [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3166.16s)]
*  Yeah, very much. So they nationalized industries like crazy [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3172.0s)]
*  and so just an important thing to understand about the afd in germany is [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3175.52s)]
*  They they get support consistently right now. They're polling is at 22 or so [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3179.84s)]
*  But what has kept them out of power is all these other parties refusing to normalize them refusing to go into coalition with them [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3185.2000000000003s)]
*  Literally labeled under german laws extremists [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3191.2s)]
*  Yeah [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3193.7599999999998s)]

*  The the you know intra german efforts to ostracize them look ridiculous. Yeah, and that is really dangerous long term [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3202.24s)]
*  Yeah, the world's richest guy who is kind of an icon to a bunch of people and is [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3208.88s)]
*  seated at the right hand of the president united states [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3214.0s)]

*  I mean, this is a problem with trumpism generally like it connects all the way back to some of the crazy shit hegseth said [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3221.92s)]
*  They're playing with like historical forces [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3227.92s)]
*  That you kind of can control when you unleash them this brand of nationalism far-right politics nativism [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3230.56s)]

*  they think they can control it and [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3239.12s)]
*  You know, there were a bunch of german industrials who thought they could control hitler when he was back in austria [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3241.7599999999998s)]
*  And that's not how it ended. No, do you see also the bloomberg news reported that [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3246.56s)]

*  I mean it's weird that steve bann is now calling musk truly evil and he's vowing to take him down [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3265.92s)]
*  There is this kind of intro mega fighting, but you know, I just saw a report that [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3270.24s)]

*  So it doesn't seem like bannon's winning then well, you know, ian bremmer talks about this is pretty interesting about it essentially [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3280.0s)]
*  It is the case that [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3286.3199999999997s)]
*  There are these deep ideological differences underneath the umbrella of mega, you know [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3288.56s)]

*  Globally the case too like there are different flavors of the far right, you know [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3300.86s)]
*  and bannon really is a tear it all down guy and elon really is a [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3305.04s)]
*  Regulatory capture make a lot of money and disrupt things guy and those are different ideologies. Ultimately. The problem is [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3309.18s)]
*  the weakness of all these institutions, right like the weakness of the french government and the german government and [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3315.7599999999998s)]

*  Remember this guy went to jail for financial crimes violating foreign lobbying laws and then trump pardoned him [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3347.92s)]
*  But the times reported that manifold has pitched his services to a french billionaire [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3354.1600000000003s)]

*  And no other country or group of countries can step in [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3746.3199999999997s)]
*  um to to do same [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3750.56s)]
*  Um, and I think it's been coming for a long time. There are lots of reasons [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3752.64s)]
*  Why the u.s. Led global order has been starting to erode and fall apart [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3757.3599999999997s)]
*  One is that you know russia when the soviet union collapsed didn't integrate [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3762.7999999999997s)]
*  Into the west into nato into the eu irrespective of who you blame for that the russians blame the u.s [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3767.6s)]
*  They're angry about it. Now. They're allied with like other chaos actors like north korea [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3773.2s)]
*  and iran [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3777.8399999999997s)]
*  The chinese were integrated particularly into the global economy [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3779.2s)]
*  But on the presumption by the west by the u.s [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3782.96s)]
*  Especially that as they got wealthier they would integrate into our value system into our world view [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3785.6s)]
*  They'd become as as we called it and you've called it [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3792.24s)]
*  Responsible stakeholders they have gotten a lot more powerful and wealthier, but they have not integrated [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3795.4199999999996s)]
*  They've not accepted an american worldview [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3800.24s)]
*  And instead something really interesting has happened [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3802.72s)]
*  The united states has increasingly adopted a chinese worldview much more transactional much more about power [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3806.4799999999996s)]
*  Much more of the rule of the jungle and but but trump is saying, you know, by the way chinese russia [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3813.6s)]
*  You think you guys can play that well, we can play that game a lot better than you can [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3819.76s)]
*  And we're going to get everybody to line up the way we want to and so now you have the the confluence [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3824.0s)]
*  Of those three things together at a time when the united states has consolidated a lot of power both [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3829.76s)]
*  politically because the gop is writing trump's coattails not the other way around in 2017 [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3838.3s)]
*  Because he's appointed all these loyalists in his administration as opposed to [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3844.32s)]
*  Establishment republican figures who were much more independent in 2017 [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3848.86s)]
*  But also because the u.s is in such a better position than so many other countries its adversaries [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3852.8s)]
*  Are much weaker russia's in serious decline iran has just lost its empire in the middle east [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3859.1200000000003s)]
*  China's in the worst economic position since the 90s maybe even the 70s [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3863.76s)]
*  And america's allies not only are in an economically technologically and militarily much worse position [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3867.6000000000004s)]
*  But their governments are also much weaker much more fragmented as we see with like south korea and germany [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3874.88s)]
*  And france and canada all imploding right now and even other governments like japan [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3881.44s)]
*  And the uk facing huge huge headwinds [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3887.04s)]
*  So for all of those reasons the top risk this year is not about one leader about one country. It's really structural [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3889.52s)]
*  Right and and it's going to manifest in so many different ways [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3898.4s)]
*  With so many different actors around the world [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3902.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting in looking at your report and and I wanted to step back and have this kind of conversation with you [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3905.44s)]
*  um, you you reference the [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3911.1200000000003s)]
*  There is a historical analogy the 30s [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3913.76s)]
*  Obviously the pre-world war two period the onset of the cold war which obviously felt like a very dangerous time [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3916.6400000000003s)]
*  I might add to that even like the pre-world war one days [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3923.0400000000004s)]
*  And and in the sense that you have these competing great powers without an order governing it [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3926.56s)]
*  And I wonder what you make of the fact that you know, you already have russia and ukraine [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3932.4s)]
*  You've got the taiwan hot spot as a potential for a chinese [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3938.48s)]
*  Military action. We've obviously been living through a period of war in the middle east and now you have trump, you know [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3943.52s)]
*  threatening territorial aggression again in greenland and panama as much as people may laugh at that [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3949.42s)]
*  I take it kind of seriously [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3955.2s)]
*  What do you see as the risk of? [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3957.28s)]
*  this kind of increasing [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3959.44s)]
*  great power [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3961.76s)]
*  Aggression like throwing your weight around in your neighborhood [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3963.36s)]
*  leading to [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3967.04s)]
*  A risk of actual great power conflict because usually in history when great powers start with territorial ambitions end up bumping into each other [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3968.56s)]
*  How do you equate that risk for 2025? So I've got three different things I can say here [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3976.2400000000002s)]
*  um one is that traditionally [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3981.2s)]
*  When we talk about that kind of changing global order leading to great power conflict [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3984.0s)]
*  It's because one great power is declining and another great power is rising [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3988.64s)]
*  And you know, we talk about that as the thucydides trap graham allison wrote that, you know a big, you know book about 10 years ago [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=3993.68s)]
*  Here the united states is not declining at all other than its political system [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4000.96s)]
*  But I mean certainly not in its ability to project power around the world which trump is very interested in doing so [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4006.0s)]
*  I don't see that in fact right now [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4013.2s)]
*  China is much more inclined to try to cut deals with countries because they're weak [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4016.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean we see that on india [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4022.56s)]
*  They just had the first summit meeting in over five years and they withdrew [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4024.56s)]
*  From their contested border um to try to improve diplomatic and economic relations same thing with their outreach to japan same thing with their outreach [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4029.2799999999997s)]
*  To the europeans to other countries around the world [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4038.24s)]
*  So there's and russia of course is in very severe decline. That's another very specific problem and russia and china do not have [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4040.7999999999997s)]
*  An alliance in my view even though their their um, their interests [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4047.36s)]
*  Geopolitically are in many ways aligned and overlapping. They're all they're all so many person [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4052.54s)]
*  I would not put russia in the same camp as tony blinken did in his recent foreign affairs piece with north korea [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4057.6s)]
*  Russia and iran, I think china's in a separate camp [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4065.52s)]
*  Than that in a different camp. They're an adversary. They're a competitor, but they're not a chaos actor [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4068.72s)]
*  And they're not always an enemy. So I would but so that's one point [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4074.08s)]
*  but the the the second uh point [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4078.88s)]
*  as to where [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4082.64s)]
*  We are now heading uh compared to these adversaries that are other major powers with military designs on [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4084.96s)]
*  parts of the world china with taiwan in the south china sea [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4092.64s)]
*  Russia with ukraine georgia moldova the balts all that kind of stuff areas of the balts [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4096.0s)]
*  Is that yes [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4102.400000000001s)]
*  I accept the idea that the americans have been promoting [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4104.400000000001s)]
*  rule of law [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4108.64s)]
*  And american exceptionalism which was frequently [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4110.16s)]
*  Hypocritical and not always well executed on and certainly not always well implemented and the russians and chinese would constantly call us [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4112.9400000000005s)]
*  Hypocritical and instead we're now saying [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4119.900000000001s)]
*  Actually [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4124.0s)]
*  No, you know, we got we're all just power players and and that provides [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4125.44s)]
*  I mean what trump is saying about the panama canal is very analogous to the arguments that putin has made about [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4130.16s)]
*  Crimea. Yeah, right very analogous. Um, and and completely undermines territorial integrity and sovereignty [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4137.099999999999s)]
*  And the united nations with the which the u.s created right all of that stuff [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4143.679999999999s)]
*  So on the one hand, I completely agree with where your question is going there [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4148.24s)]
*  On the other [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4152.400000000001s)]
*  the united states [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4154.400000000001s)]
*  Um is not prepared in my view not under biden and not under trump [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4156.4800000000005s)]
*  to allow russia to take over ukraine [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4162.4800000000005s)]
*  and [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4165.84s)]
*  in fact [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4166.88s)]
*  Uh trump has been pushing european allies to spend a lot more money on defense [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4168.400000000001s)]
*  And they feel more urgency with that under trump than they did under biden [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4174.08s)]
*  Um, you know mark ruta talking about a three percent gdp defense spend across the board [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4178.56s)]
*  And I assume they are going to make progress on that from the european leaders i've spoken with that's not something putin wants [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4185.68s)]
*  And you know taking a few months to get ukraine in a stronger position to negotiate with russia [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4192.8s)]
*  Is not what putin wants and it's not at all clear to me [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4199.12s)]
*  That even though putin clearly prefers trump in many ways to biden and harris [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4202.96s)]
*  And and the money that they spent in disinformation campaigns [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4208.639999999999s)]
*  Showed that to be the case [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4213.679999999999s)]
*  It is not clear to me that they suddenly get a free ride [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4215.84s)]
*  You know a hall pass on their territorial ambitions now that the americans have said, okay [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4220.16s)]
*  We're all about rule of the jungle and and with china as well. I think the china the chinese [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4225.76s)]
*  I think we're really concerned about trump becoming it and clearly the iranians [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4232.639999999999s)]
*  Right if yeah, I mean you didn't ask about iran [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4237.12s)]
*  But I mean let's face it given where israel is and given you know trump's support of israel in an even more stride in fashion [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4239.44s)]
*  Than the biden administration had you can easily see that iran [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4246.08s)]
*  Might feel like they're going to face being taken out their nuclear program at least by the u.s [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4251.44s)]
*  And by israel, I don't think that's going to happen, but I think it's plausible right especially over four years of a trump term [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4256.08s)]
*  Yeah, so on trump, I mean he he occupies a couple spots on your list [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4261.919999999999s)]
*  One that has to do in ways. Yeah, and and I think it's you know accurate to to separate out [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4267.04s)]
*  One is essentially that there there are no checks on his power this time around [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4272.48s)]
*  He's got a cabinet's, you know today we're talking it's pete hexes confirmation hearing that is not jim mattis, you know [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4276.639999999999s)]
*  And you can look across the board. It's loyalist the republican party is completely in his image now unlike in 2017 [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4283.5199999999995s)]
*  That and then you talk about his economic policies. I mean [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4290.320000000001s)]
*  You know one could listen to you and say well, maybe trump's on to something. It's a transactional world [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4293.84s)]
*  Let's you know discard with the hypocrisy [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4299.68s)]
*  And just uh, you know, I throw our weight around where we feel like it [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4303.360000000001s)]
*  On the other hand though, you know this brand of leadership [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4308.400000000001s)]
*  Tends to go to dark places [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4312.0s)]
*  I mean [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4313.280000000001s)]
*  What are you most worried about as we approach inauguration in terms of what a second trump term could do [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4314.08s)]
*  For global stability and and and really the lives of people here in the u.s [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4319.76s)]
*  Well, you know, i'm probably most worried about something long term [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4323.92s)]
*  which is that um [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4328.24s)]
*  a [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4330.0s)]
*  transactional us [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4330.86s)]
*  That is going to leverage its power in ways that will build [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4332.5599999999995s)]
*  A series of hub and spoke relations that work better for the u.s [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4337.44s)]
*  Which by the way is the chinese worldview over the last 30 years [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4341.28s)]
*  That's what they've done belt road initiative from the u.s [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4344.8s)]
*  Right the the gulf, you know some places in asia some places in latin america [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4347.28s)]
*  Yeah [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4351.76s)]
*  Yeah [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4352.24s)]
*  And the u.s dominates in ai and the chinese dominate in you know post carbon energy transition and those are the two most structurally important technological [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4352.4s)]
*  Drivers of like humanity for the next 20 years like it's that that is interesting [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4358.96s)]
*  And I might be I don't like it. It does not resonate with me [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4364.08s)]
*  uh [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4368.0s)]
*  Personally, it doesn't touch my soul. It's not who I am as a human [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4368.88s)]
*  But as a political scientist I can see how that [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4373.76s)]
*  Kind of a strategy could be quite successful [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4377.6s)]
*  If it could be like china's [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4381.4400000000005s)]
*  implemented [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4384.06s)]
*  Strategically over a long period of time which americas cannot be yeah [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4385.58s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4390.08s)]
*  Because the united states has an election every two years and a presidential every four [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4390.96s)]
*  And and there are constraints on trump in the sense that the elections are run by states and they can't be easily rigged [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4397.04s)]
*  And there is a professional military and there is an appointed judiciary, which is independent [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4404.0s)]
*  And that is still true no matter how many challenges and no matter how much erosion we've seen [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4408.719999999999s)]
*  And so the ability of trump to ensure that if the dems take the house in two years [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4412.799999999999s)]
*  Which looks reasonably likely to me that he's still going to be able to implement the way he can for the the next two [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4418.0s)]
*  Seems very constrained and after he's gone when he's 82 [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4424.320000000001s)]
*  And how much influence would he have even if a republican won? [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4428.08s)]
*  I I you know, I would say very hard to implement a policy like that and that means that you have thrown away [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4431.360000000001s)]
*  So much of what the u.s [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4438.64s)]
*  Has worked to build. I mean these institutions that are now going to be [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4440.64s)]
*  on defense [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4446.08s)]
*  And on and maybe on life support because the americans are going to beat them up and ignore them [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4447.68s)]
*  And you know first and foremost the icc the international criminal court, right? [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4452.719999999999s)]
*  Which the u.s hasn't even joined [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4457.84s)]
*  but but also like the wto [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4460.48s)]
*  The world health organization the un if we choose not to provide dues anymore and the chinese are going to do it [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4464.08s)]
*  They'll pay dues so they'll have vastly more influence over who's appointed in the secretariat and key positions for global governance and regulation [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4469.84s)]
*  Which is really important lots of places like I I certainly don't want to cede [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4477.84s)]
*  influence over u.s created [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4483.26s)]
*  us led [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4486.96s)]
*  Organizations in return for a policy that we can't even implement on for a period of 10 or 20 years [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4488.9400000000005s)]
*  I don't want to do that to be cynical might it also just be kind of a [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4496.08s)]
*  corruption period like trump is gonna [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4500.64s)]
*  You know through his associates and family members enrich himself in the gulf and [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4503.6s)]
*  In you know in other parts of the world. I mean [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4508.4800000000005s)]
*  Sometimes are we applying too much strategic vision to trump when it may just be some bottom line? [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4511.76s)]
*  Corruption that's going to take place. Well, certainly in his first term [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4518.72s)]
*  There was corruption [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4522.4800000000005s)]
*  Um, and I mean look there's been corruption in lots of u.s [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4524.16s)]
*  Administrations on both sides of the aisle and also in my own mayor in new york city right now [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4528.08s)]
*  And you know, I mean jesus like there's plenty right? [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4534.56s)]
*  But if I look at what I see is particularly unusual about trump [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4537.52s)]
*  That really sets him aside from other american leaders. It's not his level of corruption, right? [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4542.88s)]
*  I mean because it's it's not actually we're not talking about huge numbers. It's not for the leader of the so-called free world [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4549.12s)]
*  It's not really strategic corruption [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4556.4800000000005s)]
*  Right. I mean, it's not like I mean elon operates at a different level and he's going to make a hell of a lot more [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4559.4400000000005s)]
*  From his alignment with trump. That's a different story [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4565.84s)]
*  But but for trump himself, I would know I mean when I look at strategic corruption [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4568.72s)]
*  I look at like the indian military industrial complex over the last generation like that strategic corruption, right? [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4572.96s)]
*  Jared kushner collecting a few billion dollars in the gulf is different than creating institutions that are entirely corrupted to serve [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4580.08s)]
*  Clearly, yeah, I mean and trump [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4586.96s)]
*  I mean saying evonka can get some handbags in china license and you know that that foreign leaders should pay full rack rate [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4588.96s)]
*  At a trump hotel when they go do a conference like that's just not strategic corruption. I've i've [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4596.0s)]
*  Trump spends so much more time on other stuff than he does on how to enrich himself [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4601.6s)]
*  Which is interesting right [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4607.92s)]
*  As president and I I think where trump is really unique [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4609.92s)]
*  Is in having zero interest in promoting us values or even believing that us values exist [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4613.92s)]
*  I think he's fundamentally far more transactional. Yeah, and far more oriented towards getting deals done one on one [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4620.5599999999995s)]
*  That's where he's really unique. Yeah, so [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4628.48s)]
*  The last thing I wanted to ask you about which is [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4631.92s)]
*  You know you are someone who's out there [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4634.4s)]
*  Kind of on the circuit, you know in addition talking to political leaders you engage a lot with the business leaders, you know [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4637.84s)]
*  uh kind of people turn up at you know at davos or the shangri-la dialogue in singapore and [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4644.16s)]
*  and [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4650.0s)]
*  One of the things i'm struck by is [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4651.2s)]
*  over say the last 20 years like my time in active politics [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4653.52s)]
*  those people [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4658.56s)]
*  Were kind of stakeholders in the system right in the in the international order [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4660.16s)]
*  That kind of created the umbrella of security for them to make enormous profits [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4664.8s)]
*  um, and yet we've seen all these problems [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4670.88s)]
*  uh from [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4674.48s)]
*  climate change to [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4676.5599999999995s)]
*  massive and growing wealth inequality [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4679.12s)]
*  uh to technological disruption [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4681.84s)]
*  The kinds of things that breed disorder [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4685.2s)]
*  Um breed frankly kind of fiscal bubbles. I think you know, I have some concerns. I'm not usually a fiscal person, but [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4688.240000000001s)]
*  I I don't really like what i'm seeing in terms of the u.s right now [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4694.88s)]
*  um [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4699.120000000001s)]
*  It strikes me that what do you make of? [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4700.8s)]
*  Elon is the extreme example, but yeah, what happened to the responsible business leader, you know [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4703.84s)]
*  I mean I I just I because because it does feel like we have a global elite [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4709.360000000001s)]
*  That is I I don't know if they are following the political elites or leading them but that that are [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4713.6s)]
*  Assuming a degree of risk [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4720.22s)]
*  That feels irrational to me. Um with their you know backing trump, you know, everybody bending the knee [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4723.28s)]
*  um [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4729.76s)]
*  What do you how would you describe the mindset? [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4730.88s)]
*  Of the kind of business leader who you know 15 years ago [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4733.68s)]
*  They might like low taxes and less regulation, but they wanted a stable international system to to endure [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4736.4s)]
*  Those people now seem to be like we'll take elon as the extreme example farmer willing to be disruptors. Um, why is that? [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4742.88s)]
*  Well, I think that most ceos that I know would still prefer [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4751.12s)]
*  a stable u.s-led globalized system where capital [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4756.639999999999s)]
*  um and and goods and services and people can move freely with little friction because they make a lot more money in that environment [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4761.679999999999s)]
*  And they would like smaller governments and they would like regulatory capture by them [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4770.24s)]
*  That is still the the baseline [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4776.32s)]
*  And there are things they like about trump and the things they generally like about trump are not [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4778.64s)]
*  His being a chaos actor the thing they like about trump is the fact that he [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4784.56s)]
*  lowered taxes in 2017 and will extend that for businesses and for high net worth individuals and that he's also pulled back [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4788.64s)]
*  On regulation which they intend to do with doge and they'll have some success on more success than taking money out of the budget [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4796.56s)]
*  Um, and and they also want to just generally reduce regulation to allow the private sector to do more. That's pretty consistent [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4803.36s)]
*  Um, what is problematic is the fact that the u.s political system unlike other advanced industrial economies [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4810.88s)]
*  Has increasingly become captured by moneyed special interests. Yeah, so like a post citizens united kind of world [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4817.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it's a two three billion dollar [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4823.44s)]
*  Two-year election which I mean that's way out of whack with every other advanced industrial economy [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4826.48s)]
*  When you as elon spend 250 million dollars on a presidency you expect a significant return and I think he will be richly rewarded [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4832.48s)]
*  Um, but it's not just him. It's everywhere [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4840.24s)]
*  Um, and it's not just big business [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4842.96s)]
*  It's also any special interests that can coordinate and get money whether it's the nra [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4845.12s)]
*  Um, or whether it's apac or whether it's you know, your local police union [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4851.860000000001s)]
*  I mean these are your problems. Yeah, and so, I mean I think that what and what that has engendered [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4856.900000000001s)]
*  Is a large number of americans [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4863.06s)]
*  Um that really believe that their leaders do not represent them [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4865.9400000000005s)]
*  Um, and it's much more toxic. It's much more potentially violent [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4870.26s)]
*  It is obviously driven algorithmically [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4875.299999999999s)]
*  In ways that are very dangerous for the united states and for the american citizens and what's interesting about trump what I find unique about trump [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4878.42s)]
*  especially [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4886.16s)]
*  after this election [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAERaZfE3BU&t=4887.54s)]
