# World Reacts to Trump's Guilty Verdict, Leaders Including Putin & Viktor Orbán Come to His Defense
**Pod Save the World:** [June 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE)
*  Welcome to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Ben Rhodes. It's good to be back. Welcome back. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=0.0s)]
*  Thanks for holding it down, you guys. We held it down. We survived. You're talking to the Prime [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=5.28s)]
*  Ministers of Norway at 3 a.m. in Singapore? Yeah, I mean, that's the thing that the world doesn't see. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=10.72s)]
*  I was in Singapore. So, well, actually, the worst part is I set my alarm to wake up at like 2 50, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=14.88s)]
*  you know, and then I wake up to a message from Alona that he's delayed by 30 minutes. So then [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  I just kind of had to sit around for 3 30 in the morning, stay awake, don't fall asleep. Yeah, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=28.64s)]
*  that's tough. I might have been up with you, you know, we got some noises coming through the old [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=33.84s)]
*  Nanit machines these days, two different babies barking at us. Yeah, that's it. I told you that's [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=37.92s)]
*  a massive logistics change. Oh, yeah. But I was like you, I, you know, I was mainly responsible [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=43.28s)]
*  for the older one. So like it was, you know, a lot of lots of stroller walks, you know, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=50.16s)]
*  yeah, lots of QT. Lizette and I are having a good time. James is great. He's a cute little guy. But [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=57.12s)]
*  right now I'm not as useful to him as his mother is. No, no, right now. Right now. For obvious [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=62.4s)]
*  reasons. You have very little offer in that department. Yeah, but a lot has happened. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  Now I have two kids and the Celtics are in the NBA final spin. Yeah. Well, you missed the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=68.96s)]
*  heartbreak. The Knicks were, you know, caught lightning in a bottle until every single one of [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  their players literally every single one of their players just hurt by the end. So tough run. But [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=79.68s)]
*  we've currently exhausted our sports. Well, I will say my quarter. I said this to you on the happy [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=84.64s)]
*  news, but James is my middle name. Yeah. And my father's name. So it's a great name. You have a [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=91.76s)]
*  you have a lot of Rhodes lineage. Rhodes, Rhodes, legacy dynasty. We got a great show, Ben. It's [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  good to be back. I miss doing it. You guys did an amazing job, but I do miss getting to talk with [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=102.88000000000001s)]
*  you every week about this stuff. So today we're going to cover President Biden's Gaza ceasefire [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=107.44s)]
*  plan that he laid out last week. We're going to try to understand why on earth a couple of Democrats, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=112.08s)]
*  a bunch of Democrats, invited Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu to address a joint session [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  of Congress. Seems like we've seen this movie before. We'll talk about the global response [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=122.0s)]
*  to Donald Trump's guilty verdicts, the Biden administration's major policy change when it [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=126.32s)]
*  comes to the war in Ukraine, huge election news out of the UK, India and South Africa, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=130.72s)]
*  and a nuclear armed balloon cigarette standoff. I don't know that you know what that's referring [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=136.0s)]
*  to. I think I do actually. OK, I'm excited to talk about it. There's poop involved too, right? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=140.64s)]
*  DVD. We'll find out. Then you're going to hear my conversation with our former colleague, Dan [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=145.76s)]
*  Restrepo, about the historic elections that just took place in Mexico and what it means [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=150.16s)]
*  for US Mexico relations. So stick around for that big, big one. It's jam packed. There's a [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=155.12s)]
*  lot going on this month, this year, this quarter. Yes. Yeah. The year of elections is kicking up. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=160.56s)]
*  Honestly, throwing some curveballs at us and things we did not expect to happen. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=167.6s)]
*  We had some healthy curveballs. We'll get to that in a second. But let's start in Gaza, Ben, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=170.8s)]
*  because it feels like a lot has happened since I left, but nothing has changed, if that makes sense. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=175.6s)]
*  That's very fair. Well, actually, you caught my ICC rant, but there were subsequent international [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=181.04s)]
*  criminal decisions. Yeah, a lot going on. Yeah, a lot going on. So OK, last Friday, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=188.48s)]
*  President Biden laid out his ceasefire deal and long term plan to end the war. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=194.0s)]
*  Here's a clip from that speech. At this point, Hamas no longer is capable of carrying out another [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=199.04s)]
*  October 7th. It's one of Israel's main objectives in this war and quite frankly, a righteous one. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=205.6s)]
*  And to the people of Israel, let me say this. As someone who's had a lifelong commitment to Israel, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=212.48s)]
*  as the only American president has ever gone to Israel in a time of war, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=219.84s)]
*  as someone who just sent the U.S. forces to directly defend Israel when it was attacked by Iran, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=224.0s)]
*  I ask you to take a step back and think what will happen if this moment is lost. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=231.51999999999998s)]
*  We can't lose this moment. So the plan Biden laid out, it has three phases. Phase one is a six week [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=238.88000000000002s)]
*  ceasefire agreement. During that period, Israel would withdraw troops from Gaza's major population [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=245.44000000000003s)]
*  centers, allow 600 A trucks per day into Gaza, release some Palestinian prisoners and allow [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=250.4s)]
*  Gazans to return home to northern Gaza. And in exchange, Hamas would release women, elderly and [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  wounded hostages. Then you'd have phase two that would include an end of hostilities. The Israeli [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  military would withdraw from Gaza completely. There would be potentially the release of some [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=267.04s)]
*  more Palestinian prisoners and Hamas would release the remaining living hostages. Phase three is this [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=271.68s)]
*  kind of nebulous multi-year reconstruction period for Gaza and Hamas would return the remains of any [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  hostages who died in Gaza and their bodies hadn't been returned yet. So getting Hamas and Israel to [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=284.32000000000005s)]
*  agree to this proposal would be challenging, I think, and under any circumstances. But it got [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=291.20000000000005s)]
*  complicated immediately when Bibi Netanyahu seemed to deny that Israel had agreed to this deal. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=296.8s)]
*  So the White House, let's talk about this. The White House's adamant that Biden laid out in that [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=303.04s)]
*  speech, an Israeli proposal that had already been sent to Qatar to convey to Hamas. That has been [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=308.16s)]
*  confirmed in a bunch of news reports from Israeli and Qatari officials. The Wall Street Journal [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=316.0s)]
*  reported that in private Netanyahu has been showing cautious support for this peace plan. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=320.8s)]
*  But wants flexibility to resume fighting later, which kind of seems like a deal breaker for a [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=325.52s)]
*  plan to end the war. Then we were talking about this before we started recording. Axios is [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=331.76s)]
*  reported that Israeli officials are worried that Netanyahu's comments are undercutting this plan [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=337.03999999999996s)]
*  and undermining what they described as constructive ambiguity about some of the ways that negotiators [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=344.08s)]
*  are trying to basically massage a plan that both sides can agree to. The political challenge seems [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=350.96s)]
*  to be the same thing, which is that Netanyahu has these right-wing ministers in his coalition [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=357.2s)]
*  that have threatened repeatedly to pull out of the government if Netanyahu accepts a ceasefire [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=361.52s)]
*  proposal and then Netanyahu would be out of power. But Ben, let's just start with the big picture. So [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=367.44s)]
*  the White House says this was an Israeli agree-to plan. We should talk about whether you [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=372.47999999999996s)]
*  think that that's accurate. But also, they said that the goal here, the reason Biden [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=376.88s)]
*  laid this all out publicly, was to put pressure on all sides to agree to it and to build international [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=382.32s)]
*  support. Do you think that's the right way to think about it? Is saying this stuff publicly, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=386.48s)]
*  does that help put pressure on both sides? So here's what I think is happening, Tommy. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=390.24s)]
*  And this is really just based on my informed analysis. This isn't something I've heard. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=395.6s)]
*  The first thing I'd say is that in my experience, particularly on Israeli-Palestinian talks, which [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=402.23999999999995s)]
*  happened several times in the Obama administration, there were times when Netanyahu would [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=409.11999999999995s)]
*  indicate agreement with some proposal, but not publicly say that he'd agreed to it. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=416.88s)]
*  And then what he would do is he would wait until the Palestinians didn't accept the proposal. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=424.71999999999997s)]
*  And oftentimes the Palestinians wouldn't accept the proposal because they didn't believe Netanyahu [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=432.88s)]
*  would. And then he'd blame the Palestinians for the proposal not getting done. And we hear the [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=436.71999999999997s)]
*  endless refrain of the Palestinians never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity. And his whole [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=442.64s)]
*  game was to blame the Palestinians for the failure to reach an agreement. Now, that was with the [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=448.4s)]
*  Palestinian Authority, not Hamas. But I think that's what's been happening here. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=453.12s)]
*  You also deliberately pretend he didn't understand the proposal Obama put forward. Obama would say, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=457.28000000000003s)]
*  let's do a two-state solution based on 1967 lines with agreed-upon swaps. And he would pretend he [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=463.36s)]
*  didn't hear about the part about agreed-upon swaps of territory where the Israelis had built [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=469.04s)]
*  settlements for. And then he publicly trashed a proposal that he'd been negotiating on in private. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=473.76s)]
*  He did this kind of thing all the time. We'd have terms of reference even for getting an [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=479.04s)]
*  negotiation that his negotiators would indicate an openness to. But yes, if it ever became public, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=482.8s)]
*  he'd shoot it down. So I think that probably what's been happening is Bill Burns and all these [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=488.88s)]
*  people have been negotiating for months around probably a similar ceasefire proposal. And this [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=494.56s)]
*  kind of blame game has been going back and forth. And I think what the administration chose to do [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=501.12s)]
*  here in kind of a Hail Mary is essentially announce what they think Israeli negotiators [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=505.2s)]
*  had agreed to, but Bibi had not been willing to publicly say he'd support, in the hopes that [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=514.56s)]
*  one of two things would happen. One, by going public, you apply a lot of pressure on all the [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=521.28s)]
*  parties, including Hamas, and you get a ceasefire because Hamas says, okay, the Qatar leans on them, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=527.52s)]
*  we lean on them, and they say, fine, we'll do this, and then Bibi does it. That's option one. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=533.92s)]
*  Option two is you collapse Bibi's government. So it may be, and they'll never say this publicly, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=540.7199999999999s)]
*  that part of their intention is to force Bibi to choose. And because there's a lot of pressure [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=546.4s)]
*  from the United States and from the rest of the war cabinet, people like Benny Gantz have presumably [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=552.56s)]
*  signed off on this, that Bibi has to agree to it. And then those right-wing ministers leave the [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=557.04s)]
*  government and it collapses, and maybe that's something that the US is okay bringing about. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=562.96s)]
*  So it's like a high-stakes gamble that- But do you think that math works? Because I think if [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=569.12s)]
*  Benny Gantz and the moderates pull out of the coalition, Netanyahu still has the numbers to [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=573.2800000000001s)]
*  keep the government intact. But if he loses the right-wing ministers, he doesn't. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=577.2800000000001s)]
*  So this leads to the third and unfortunately likely option, which is that this kind of dies somehow [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=580.48s)]
*  because Bibi's trying to triangulate between the center and the right. Hamas is trying to [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=590.16s)]
*  renegotiate some element and it kind of doesn't go through. And then we've kind of set up a dynamic [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=596.64s)]
*  where we've kind of, let's face it, pretty disingenuously, we've kind of kept asserting [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=603.4399999999999s)]
*  that this is an Israeli proposal, even though Israel hasn't formally agreed to it. And so then [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=608.64s)]
*  Hamas, we just blame Hamas for- I mean, Bibi could emerge in a situation where [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=613.68s)]
*  this deal collapses, he maintains his government, he blames Hamas. He blames Hamas by saying the US [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=619.68s)]
*  presented this to Hamas. He comes to the US to deliver a joint session as this kind of big hero [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=626.7199999999999s)]
*  in front of Congress, and the war is still going and we've kind of legitimized it because we've [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=632.56s)]
*  kind of suggested it's Hamas' fault that the war hasn't stopped. That's the scenario that would be [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=637.68s)]
*  bad here. And so they're playing a pretty high stakes game. And look, if it works and they get [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=642.24s)]
*  a ceasefire, that's great. But if it doesn't, there's some real risk that you set up a dynamic, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=648.16s)]
*  which the core dynamic is do you think the ceasefire should happen in any case? In other words, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=654.96s)]
*  ceasefire agreement or not, do you believe this war should end, in which case you'd be [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=663.52s)]
*  threatening to withhold weapons and things like that? Or do you kind of risk saying, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=667.9200000000001s)]
*  we somehow sided with an Israeli proposal, even though Bibi didn't embrace it, and it's all Hamas' [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=675.44s)]
*  fault, and so therefore it's kind of de facto okay that the war goes on. And that's the real risk, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=680.0s)]
*  I see. Well, so the confusing thing is you're seeing all these background quotes from the [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=684.48s)]
*  administration saying, you put forward this plan, put pressure on Netanyahu to get him to accept it. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=688.1600000000001s)]
*  But also, Biden did this long interview with Time Magazine, most of it focused on foreign policy, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=692.64s)]
*  and he was asked whose fault is it that the deal or ceasefire for hostages has not been consummated? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=697.68s)]
*  Is it Hamas or Israel both? He says Hamas. Hamas could end this tomorrow. So he is very publicly [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=703.4399999999999s)]
*  on the record just blaming Hamas. Now, in his defense, in Israel's defense, the Wall Street [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=708.3199999999999s)]
*  Journal reported that Yaya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas within Gaza, like the guy in the tunnels [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=713.92s)]
*  doing the fighting, not the kind of corrupt political leaders sitting in Qatar, that he [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=721.2s)]
*  has told Arab mediators that he's in no rush to end the war and he wants to drag Israel into [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=727.5200000000001s)]
*  a quagmire that creates more sympathy for the Palestinian cause. Yeah, and this is, again, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=732.08s)]
*  where I kind of philosophically disagree with the administration. Again, if this works, it's great, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=736.88s)]
*  you get a ceasefire. But Hamas is a terrorist organization. If we believe that to be true, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=741.0400000000001s)]
*  and I do, it's strange to kind of put this all on like a negotiated agreement with them. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=748.4s)]
*  You either think what Israel is doing is the right thing to be doing or you don't. In other words, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=756.9599999999999s)]
*  by saying this is all up to Hamas, it's kind of suggesting, well, if Hamas doesn't reach an [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=764.3199999999999s)]
*  agreement, will the war ever end? Because that's what Sinwar's position is. Then he wants the most [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=770.24s)]
*  destructive, worst possible war so that he can kind of create a open-ended insurgency and isolate [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=781.04s)]
*  Israel internationally. And so you're basically saying, if we're backing Israel, we're going to [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=788.16s)]
*  give Hamas exactly what they want if they don't agree to this. And that doesn't make any sense. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=795.2s)]
*  That's the problem with this whole paradigm. Yeah. And it's like, look, I can't confirm or deny what [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=800.88s)]
*  this Wall Street Journal report says, but it's worth just considering that one of the actors [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=805.0400000000001s)]
*  involved here, like the leader of Hamas, might have a logic that it makes absolutely no sense to us. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=810.24s)]
*  It seems completely irrational. It's basically like saying, hey, these guys over here are arsonists. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=815.12s)]
*  And if these arsonists don't do what we want, we're going to go pour gasoline on their fire. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=820.0s)]
*  That really is what we're talking about here. And that's why it's a high stakes game because, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=825.8399999999999s)]
*  again, maybe it works and you kind of run this air pocket of pressuring everybody into a ceasefire. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=830.0s)]
*  But if you don't, it's hard to see what a plan B looks like because you've kind of legitimized [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=836.64s)]
*  the idea that so long as Hamas is not negotiating in the way you'd like, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=842.4s)]
*  that the war just goes on and on and on and on. Yeah. I heard an analyst on, I think it was on [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=847.36s)]
*  the BBC, suggests that if this ceasefire proposal fails, that President Biden should start [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=851.52s)]
*  a unilateral negotiation with Hamas to free American hostages. Now, hearing that [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=857.12s)]
*  sort of shocked me that I've never heard anyone sort of float that before. Yeah. You would imagine [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=862.8s)]
*  in a lot of other contexts that could happen. That's what we do. That's exactly what we do in [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=867.04s)]
*  those contexts. But the politics doing that here, I think, would probably be unthinkable. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=870.0799999999999s)]
*  But Ben, let's turn to this joint session because leaders in Congress, including Democrats, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=874.16s)]
*  Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries on the House side, joined in with Republican congressional [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=878.56s)]
*  leaders to invite Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu to deliver a speech to a joint session [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=883.3599999999999s)]
*  of Congress. There were some reports that it was going to happen on June 13th, but then it turned [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=888.0s)]
*  out that that's a Jewish holiday. So whoopsie doopsie. Good fact checking, guys. Great work, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=892.56s)]
*  gang. And then Biden was going to be in the G7 at the time, so I don't know what happened there. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=897.5999999999999s)]
*  So Ben, so the dates TBD. I get why Republicans want to do this, right? Like their right wing [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=901.76s)]
*  evangelical base, they want the US to fully support the Israeli war effort. They're not [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=908.16s)]
*  concerned about civilian casualties in Gaza or anything else. And then Mitch McConnell, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=912.56s)]
*  Speaker Johnson, they want to use criticism of Israel by Democrats as a wedge issue to peel [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=919.12s)]
*  off Jewish voters and donors from the Democratic Party. That's their plan, they say it out loud. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=924.64s)]
*  For the life of me, I cannot understand what Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries are doing here. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=930.9599999999999s)]
*  Maybe they were worried that not joining on this invitation would be used as a cudgel to attack [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=937.2s)]
*  Democrats, but it seems far more likely to me that Netanyahu coming to the US giving this speech [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=944.24s)]
*  will just create a really high profile way to highlight the splits between the Biden administration [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=950.8000000000001s)]
*  and the Israeli government on policy. And just a couple of weeks ago, Schumer [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=958.96s)]
*  literally called on Netanyahu to step down and no longer be the leader. What happened? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=962.8s)]
*  Everything about this is wrong and frustrating and what I don't like about Washington, right? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=968.08s)]
*  Let's just kind of go through the ways in which this is the wrong thing. First of all, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=974.32s)]
*  right now the US government is in a open facing pressure campaign to kind of squeeze Netanyahu [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=978.4s)]
*  into the terms of a ceasefire that Netanyahu is uncomfortable with. And yet, within a week or two, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=985.44s)]
*  however long it is, the US Congress is going to give Netanyahu the biggest political lifeline [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=992.24s)]
*  imaginable, which is, hey, you're not isolated. In fact, you're going to come here and you're [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=996.8s)]
*  going to get standing ovations from a bipartisan group of members of Congress. So it undercuts [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1000.72s)]
*  US policy objectives, right? So that's bad. Politically, Schumer has said he thinks Israel [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1006.0s)]
*  needs a new leader. I think if you probably poll Democrats in private, the vast majority of them [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1012.72s)]
*  would say that as well. Everyone in the White House would say that. This is clearly going to [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1016.88s)]
*  boost Netanyahu's standing. There's no question that he will return from this trip to Israel [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1020.88s)]
*  with higher polling numbers and feeling like he's in a stronger position because he will have [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1025.36s)]
*  proven that he's the guy that can work the US and manipulate the US. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1030.08s)]
*  He brags about that publicly. There's him on video saying, I'm the guy who can manipulate the US, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1033.76s)]
*  especially the US media. So it's dumb in terms of your Israeli political objectives, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1037.84s)]
*  domestic political objectives. Whatever these guys think about how they're making it less painful by [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1041.68s)]
*  he's coming here to divide Democrats. Bibi Netanyahu wants Donald Trump to win the election. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1047.84s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1052.32s)]
*  The Republican Party knows that. The Republican Party will be unified in welcoming Netanyahu. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1052.8799999999999s)]
*  The Democratic Party will be divided. By definition, this is an offensive move by [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1057.6s)]
*  Republicans. The last time Bibi came, he was only invited by Republicans. It was to undercut [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1062.8s)]
*  Barack Obama. So to sum up, it's a self-owned in terms of domestic politics. It's a self-owned [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1067.6s)]
*  in terms of Israeli politics and it's a self-owned in terms of the policy. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1074.0s)]
*  Great work, guys. I just don't know what is explaining to me the logic of doing it [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1078.88s)]
*  beyond not to be cynical, like you get some less pissed off donor calls. Oh, by the way, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1085.12s)]
*  they're also going to probably roll out a bunch of crazy legislation around him coming here [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1090.8s)]
*  to sanction the ICC or to ... Never mind just the optics. This man has literally just had [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1095.68s)]
*  an arrest warrant sought for him as a war criminal and then the US Congress likes to lecture [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1101.68s)]
*  about Putin's war crimes and the part of the international order we like. We're going to [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1108.0s)]
*  platform this guy. It's just great work, everybody. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1113.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm so frustrated by this. I cannot understand it for the life of me. Maybe there's an ICC [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1118.24s)]
*  rendition team that'll snap, get them on the way in. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1122.24s)]
*  Yeah, the global police force. It's a mess. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1124.72s)]
*  Last thing on this. Biden did a long interview with Time Magazine. I think it was mostly- [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1130.88s)]
*  Interesting comms decision there, Tommy. No offense to Time Magazine, but would you be [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1133.84s)]
*  recommending that that's the- I think offense to Time Magazine. Probably not. That would not [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1137.84s)]
*  be my go-to. I think the idea was to set up his trip to the G7 next week, but they spent a long [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1142.0s)]
*  time talking about other stuff, Gaza, Israel, et cetera. A couple notable things. Biden was [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1146.8s)]
*  asked if Israel had committed war crimes in Gaza. He said, quote, the answer is it's uncertain and [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1151.84s)]
*  has been investigated by the Israelis themselves. The ICC is something that we don't recognize. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1156.56s)]
*  So sort of statement of policy there. Yeah, I mentioned he was asked by who was at fault. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1160.96s)]
*  He put the blame on Hamas. Biden was asked if Israel is intentionally using starvation of [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1165.44s)]
*  civilians as a method of warfare. He said, quote, no, I don't think that. I think they've engaged [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1170.24s)]
*  in activity that is inappropriate. Then went on, made a comparison to sort of Afghanistan. But it [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1174.64s)]
*  was interesting that he said no, but they've done things that are wrong. So clearly he's withholding [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1179.28s)]
*  something there. And then finally, then Biden was asked if Netanyahu is prolonging the war for his [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1184.0s)]
*  own political self-preservation. And he said, quote, I'm not going to comment on that. There [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1189.2s)]
*  is every reason for people to draw that conclusion, which is not the most successful effort of [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1193.36s)]
*  declining comment I've heard. Well, but it's also like, it's something that was evident to everybody [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1198.4s)]
*  in like, what, November that that was happening. So, you know, I mean, there's no reason not to say [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1202.96s)]
*  it out loud, you know. Yeah, it's. But I mean, the starvation thing, the awkward thing for the [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1206.8s)]
*  administration on all this stuff is that they've said this. They've said, you know, the aid [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1211.76s)]
*  crossings need to open up. So it's hard to square. Every day, the State Department briefing is like [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1216.4s)]
*  an exercise in trying to square public criticism with Israel, with public defenses of Israel, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1221.68s)]
*  because we're simultaneously saying they need to do more, let aid in, and then saying they're [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1227.12s)]
*  letting aid in. You know, those are hard puzzle pieces. To all the people hating on, you know, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1232.08s)]
*  Matt Miller. And it's like he's not the one making he's not the one who's writing the guidance [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1238.4s)]
*  that's been delivered to him. Yeah. And that's the State Department spokesperson. He's trying [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1243.92s)]
*  to explain a policy that at times could be incoherent. It was interesting. We're sort of [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1247.6000000000001s)]
*  observing this stepping away for a month and like reading the news, but not being on it constantly. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1250.8000000000002s)]
*  Like I took a call from a great reporter at the Washington Post. It was asking about like the [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1255.44s)]
*  Rafa Redline debate and what the ways the administration was trying to sort of, you know, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1259.44s)]
*  parse the policy to figure out whether, you know, BB had tripped their redline considerations if [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1265.36s)]
*  he did X, Y or Z. And it just made me realize like how much you can miss the big picture when [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1270.7199999999998s)]
*  you get bogged down in these kind of technical debates or these euphemistic conversations about [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1277.76s)]
*  war, where you're talking about minor military incursions versus a full scale invasion. It's like, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1283.52s)]
*  you know, you just you miss the big picture, which is that this war is a humanitarian catastrophe. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1290.24s)]
*  These people are suffering endlessly. It has been going on for months and months and months. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1295.28s)]
*  And you've got top national security officials in Israel saying that the war could go on through [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1299.92s)]
*  the end of this year. Yeah. So there's no end in sight. Yeah. And, you know, they don't have, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1304.3999999999999s)]
*  they've never suggested any plan for Gaza that doesn't involve open ended war, because if they're [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1310.0s)]
*  administrating Gaza, then you're still in, it's what Sinemar wants, right? Like an insurgency [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1316.08s)]
*  dynamic, right? But I think the way to sum up this whole thing is that when you're inside of it and [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1322.24s)]
*  when you're in government, you can rationalize, well, if we do this, this might happen and we [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1327.76s)]
*  have to kind of shade the facts over here to make this point. And what's missing is to kind of step [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1332.0s)]
*  back what's right and what's wrong here. And this is wrong. And the way in which Israel's conducted [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1339.12s)]
*  this war is wrong. And they just haven't allowed themselves to get to that place because they're [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1347.28s)]
*  still kind of trying to assemble all these pieces. Yeah. It's hard when you're in it. Let's turn from [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1353.36s)]
*  Israel's corrupt demagogue to our own. So I'm sure our listeners know that last week Trump was found [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1358.0s)]
*  guilty on all 34 counts in the New York hush money trial. Shout out Manhattan. Yeah, my people. Thanks [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1363.36s)]
*  to your people. Let's talk about the international response to this verdict. So first of all, Ben, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1368.72s)]
*  it's worth mentioning again that the Republican talking point that indicting a president or a [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1373.92s)]
*  former president is banana republic stuff. That is just nonsense. Presidents or prime ministers in [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1379.6000000000001s)]
*  France, Italy, Israel, Germany, a whole bunch of other countries. South Korea happens all the time. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1385.76s)]
*  Right. I mean, the Republican favorite, Bibi Netanyahu, is currently being indicted on [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1391.84s)]
*  corruption charges. In some cases, Israeli prime minister was convicted and sent to jail. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1395.76s)]
*  Yeah. Olmert. Yeah. Yeah. So push back hard when you hear folks say that if you're debating this [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1400.48s)]
*  with your Republican. That's kind of racist, like banana republic. I know. It feels like some kind [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1405.84s)]
*  of retro 70s. It's very dated terminology. They say, oh, this is third world. This is banana [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1409.92s)]
*  republic. By the way, it's also kind of a critique of American imperialism because these banana [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1413.84s)]
*  republics were like it was an American banana company. Right. But anyway, put that aside. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1417.44s)]
*  Yes, I did. Second, it is worth looking at the international reaction to this verdict, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1420.96s)]
*  especially who came to Trump's defense publicly. So Alona put these together. These are great. So [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1427.2s)]
*  you got a nice tweet from our favorite Hungarian autocrat, Viktor Orban, who said in part, keep [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1433.1200000000001s)]
*  fighting, Mr. President. Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesman, said US authorities were trying to [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1438.32s)]
*  eliminate political rivals, quote, by all possible legal and illegal means. So once again, irony is [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1443.8400000000001s)]
*  dead. Did he post it on Twitter? Peskov killed. I bet he did. Matteo Salvini, the leader of the [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1449.84s)]
*  Anti-immigrant League party, expressed solidarity over in Italy. And then right wing British gadfly, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1455.36s)]
*  Nigel Farage tweeted or ext. I'm just going to say tweeted forever. Quote, this verdict is a disgrace. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1462.24s)]
*  Trump will now win big. So basically, the worst of the worst people in political life all over [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1468.0s)]
*  the world came to Trump's defense. It does make you, I wonder if that occurs to him when he sees [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1473.92s)]
*  these. Well, I mean, he likes these people. So these are the people that he would align himself [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1480.48s)]
*  with, like Orban. And he just said Orban and Mar-a-Lago probably gave him some of the talking [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1485.6000000000001s)]
*  points or exchanged ideas. I mean, I just think that the, you mentioned I was in Singapore. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1491.6000000000001s)]
*  Singapore is a pretty serious place. And they had some conferences going on there when I was there, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1498.72s)]
*  including this Shangri-La defense thing. And we just look ridiculous. I mean, it's part that [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1503.44s)]
*  Trump is aligned with all the worst autocratic creepy guys. But it's also that the United States [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1510.0s)]
*  is this global superpower that is supposed to have some kind of stewardship role for avoiding [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1518.0800000000002s)]
*  wars and enforcing norms. Democracy. Yeah. And then meanwhile, we've got like a convicted felon [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1524.64s)]
*  running around undermining the whole system of government in this country. Don't think people [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1530.8799999999999s)]
*  don't notice that abroad. It makes democracy. I mean, the serious point is that part of what [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1537.28s)]
*  Putin wants is to undermine the whole idea of democracy itself. He wants to, and the Chinese [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1542.1599999999999s)]
*  want to make democracy look dysfunctional. Autocracy works better. It's more efficient. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1547.2s)]
*  And certainly it's good that I think it's good to show that we can hold people accountable. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1552.0s)]
*  Obviously, it's not good if the convicted felon is an elected president. So that ultimately will be [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1557.6799999999998s)]
*  the key moment here. Yeah. And to that point, I mean, again, Biden in that Time magazine interview [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1563.9199999999998s)]
*  was talking about the first G7 he attended after getting elected president. And he said to the [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1569.36s)]
*  assembled leaders there, America is back. And he said that French President Emmanuel Macron [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1574.8799999999999s)]
*  responded. For how long? Yeah. I think that's fair rejoinder. I have a, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1579.84s)]
*  um, this is the nerdiest thing I'll say today. I have a piece coming on Foreign Affairs. Sure. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1585.2s)]
*  You got it. Yeah. And I start with the America's back thing. And my point was like, that actually [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1590.56s)]
*  wasn't the right frame because we're not, first of all, there's no going back. You know, there's [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1595.68s)]
*  kind of a, it's not MAGA, but it's like make the rules based order and great again or something, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1601.6s)]
*  you know, like, like, like, like, like, there's not, we're not going back to something. We're in [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1606.4s)]
*  a post Trump world, you know, and then the other point is that nobody will believe Trump's gone [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1610.96s)]
*  until he's fully gone, you know, and, and so there's this idea of restoration. I think the [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1616.88s)]
*  Biden administration has done well on some of their foreign policies when they're kind of fully in the [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1623.1200000000001s)]
*  kind of post Trump world and they're adjusting to it on things like climate, on things like China [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1628.8s)]
*  policy. But when they kind of think that we can just play the old hits, you know, of the American [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1633.28s)]
*  mega superpower, people aren't buying that. It's not the way if Macron wasn't buying it in the [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1639.2s)]
*  first G7 meeting, you know, it's not by it down. All right, then let's talk about Ukraine. So there [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1644.88s)]
*  was a big policy change last week. The Biden administration officially gave Ukraine's military [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1650.96s)]
*  permission to strike within Russia with US weapons. So in fact, right before we started recording, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1656.72s)]
*  the Ukrainians confirmed they'd hit a target in Russia with US made artillery. So this is now [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1662.64s)]
*  happening. So this permission is limited to only the area near Harkiv in northeastern Ukraine, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1666.4s)]
*  where Russia has been launching these devastating, relentless airstrikes from just over the border. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1672.96s)]
*  But it's a big change for an administration that has been worried about the risk of escalation [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1677.92s)]
*  in direct conflict with Russia. The Germans and the French say they will follow suit. And now [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1681.8400000000001s)]
*  they're going to allow Ukrainians to do these cross border strikes with their weapons too. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1686.48s)]
*  So this decision obviously comes after Congress sat on its hands for seven months, I think, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1691.36s)]
*  and refused to authorize new military assistance as Ukraine stockpiles dwindled and the Russians [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1696.6399999999999s)]
*  seize the moment to press their advantage. We've been talking about this broader debate, though, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1702.32s)]
*  over escalation risk since the very beginning of the war. Ukrainians have been since really day one [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1706.9599999999998s)]
*  frustrated with US restrictions or delays in green lighting new more lethal weapons, [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1713.36s)]
*  you know, systems. But the administration usually ends up giving them what they want [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1721.36s)]
*  in the end. Here is a clip of Secretary of State Tony Blinken talking about [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1726.08s)]
*  this latest policy evolution. Going forward, we'll continue to do what we've been doing, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1730.7199999999998s)]
*  which is as necessary, adapt and adjust. And that, as I said, has been a hallmark of our [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1736.16s)]
*  engagement. It will continue to be. I've also said many, many times we want to make sure that [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1743.0400000000002s)]
*  we're proceeding deliberately as well as effectively. So I think time and again, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1750.3200000000002s)]
*  we've adapted, we've adjusted, we provided Ukraine with the systems, the weapons that it's needed. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1757.92s)]
*  But again, as I've shared with you many times before, for example, when it comes to weapon [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1763.44s)]
*  systems, we also want to make sure that they have the necessary training to use the weapons and they [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1767.2s)]
*  have the necessary capacity to maintain them. So I think both of us, we talked about this over [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1771.52s)]
*  years now, we've been pretty worried about this escalation risk that the number one job of [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1776.0800000000002s)]
*  President Biden is to avoid World War Three with Russia. But this decision did seem like a necessity [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1781.44s)]
*  to me. I mean, you've got Harkiv is about 25 miles from the Russian border. The Russians knew [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1786.8s)]
*  under these previous rules that they could literally just launch these glide bombs or [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1791.68s)]
*  artillery from well inside their border with no risk of retaliation and just pummel this second [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1796.24s)]
*  biggest city by population in Ukraine. Do you think this was the right decision and in the near [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1802.5600000000002s)]
*  term, but also stepping back and just again, remembering that the war has been escalating [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1809.92s)]
*  constantly since the very beginning. Eventually, the US and Europeans and others just get to yes [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1816.1599999999999s)]
*  on sending new, more lethal, longer range weapons. And it does seem like we're sort of boiled frogs [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1822.8s)]
*  at this point. I think this is the right decision. And it's because of the proximity to Harkiv and [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1828.3999999999999s)]
*  the way in which you listen to Zalansky, they're literally massing artillery and forces like right [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1835.9199999999998s)]
*  on the border. The Ukrainians are watching them, can't do anything about it. And then those people [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1842.72s)]
*  come and just by the time they can fire at them, they're on top of them. And if people are wondering, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1846.48s)]
*  well, why is that the case in this? It's because frankly, Russia, a lot of the other front line, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1850.8s)]
*  there's actually not a Ukrainian border with Russia anymore because the Russians are in Eastern [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1859.52s)]
*  Ukraine. And so along the front line, the Ukrainians are actually firing into occupied [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1863.3600000000001s)]
*  Eastern Ukraine at the Russians. And so this is a very specific contingency where it makes sense [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1868.96s)]
*  to say, this is actually like an extension of the front line that goes into Russia. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1874.8s)]
*  And so I think that makes sense. I also think it makes sense to restrict it because [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1880.32s)]
*  what do you not want? Well, there are US and European rockets that could hit Moscow, right? [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1884.72s)]
*  And that would be massively escalatory if all of a sudden, you're not just talking about hitting [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1891.76s)]
*  Russian forces that are staging on the border, but you're hitting Russian cities, certainly [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1898.32s)]
*  hitting Russian capital where we actually saw a Ukrainian drone a couple of times in Moscow. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1903.12s)]
*  Almost at the Kremlin, yeah. Yeah. So that to me, look, this makes sense. And you calibrate it. To [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1909.4399999999998s)]
*  your point about boiling the frog, I think there's some truth to that, which is why I think you need [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1915.04s)]
*  to have this medium term openness to negotiation, which we've talked about. So it's not just perennial [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1921.4399999999998s)]
*  escalation, but you want the Ukrainians to be in a strong position heading in negotiation. And one [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1928.16s)]
*  way to think about this is if we didn't allow something like this, the Russians are on the [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1933.6000000000001s)]
*  offensive. Maybe they take back Kharkiv. Maybe they think, well, we're not going to negotiate. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1938.48s)]
*  We're making progress on the battlefield here. You kind of have to empower your side to get to [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1941.76s)]
*  a productive negotiation. You just wonder if at some point, Zelensky decides, okay, I'm probably [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1948.48s)]
*  not going to get another weapon out of the Americans. Maybe those restrictions don't matter [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1952.3200000000002s)]
*  anymore and let's just start firing where we want to fire. One interesting thing to think about is [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1956.24s)]
*  if Trump is elected and Trump says, I'm cutting you off. And then Zelensky, one way he could think [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1960.08s)]
*  about that is, well, if they're cutting me off anyway, then why would I abide by any restrictions [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1968.8s)]
*  on anything? And so you're right. In a weird way, Trump cutting them off could incentivize dangerous [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1974.32s)]
*  escalation by the Ukrainians because with Biden, he has an incentive to kind of follow the rules so [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1981.2s)]
*  that he can get more stuff. So that, yeah, I hadn't thought about it that way, but that's [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1986.32s)]
*  another argument. It is worth noting that there's been like a half dozen different kind of like mini [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1991.28s)]
*  news cycles over fights over weapons systems. There was the High Mars, the Atacams, the Abrams [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=1996.56s)]
*  tanks, the F-16s. And every time that weapon system is treated like the key to victory for [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2002.8s)]
*  the Ukrainian side. But take the tanks, for example, there were months and months spent [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2009.68s)]
*  lobbying the Biden administration for those new Abrams tanks. They ended up sending them in [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2015.76s)]
*  conjunction with the German Leopard tanks. It was seen as this big package. And I read, I think back [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2020.16s)]
*  in April, there was an AP story about how the US delivered tanks had been taken off the front lines [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2026.24s)]
*  because they ended up being too susceptible to these cheap Russian drone attacks. So there is [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2031.44s)]
*  no panacea, I think is the key. War is flexible and changing. But also, I think the thing when [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2037.12s)]
*  you look back on those debates is there were a lot of like non-military expert, like keyboard [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2044.7199999999998s)]
*  warriors, like writing pieces for the Atlantic about how the Atacams would ensure. Those people [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2049.12s)]
*  weren't military experts, like in a lot of cases. And so let's be cautious here. The reality is, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2054.3199999999997s)]
*  since that Ukrainian offensive that made a lot of gains at the end of like, what, 2022, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2061.52s)]
*  the front line's been relatively static here. That's the reality of like the kind of trench [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2066.96s)]
*  warfare. Yeah. Again, from this Time Magazine story, which I think was meant to like set up [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2073.28s)]
*  Biden's trip to the G7 and basically the conversations around Ukraine, he was asked, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2078.64s)]
*  what is the end game in Ukraine and what does peace look like there? And Biden said, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2083.7599999999998s)]
*  peace looks like making sure Russia never, never, never, never occupies Ukraine. That's what peace [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2087.6s)]
*  looks like. And it doesn't mean NATO. It doesn't mean NATO. They're a part of NATO. It means we [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2092.16s)]
*  have a relationship with them like we do with other countries where we supply weapons so they [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2096.24s)]
*  can defend themselves in the future. Biden also said the Russian military has been decimated. It's [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2100.7999999999997s)]
*  been freaking decimated. So I think he's trying to sell that NATO is now stronger. Russia has taken [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2105.2799999999997s)]
*  a lot of losses. But there's also sort of the reality of the battlefield where Ukrainians had [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2111.36s)]
*  a tough six months. Yeah. I mean, what's notable is he's not saying success is Ukraine taking its [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2116.24s)]
*  territory back. Right. Right. And so that's an adjustment. Although the administration's [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2122.56s)]
*  usually been more careful about that than others. The one thing to watch coming up is the NATO summit [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2127.68s)]
*  is in Washington this summer. And I'm sure the Ukrainians will come. Well, one, they want to be [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2133.9199999999996s)]
*  in NATO. Two, they'll have other things that they want. So the next phase of this drama, I think, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2139.7599999999998s)]
*  is at that NATO summit because Biden, obviously, in the election year wants to probably make this [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2145.44s)]
*  seem like a huge success. But the Ukrainians will want to get something out of it. So that's the [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2149.68s)]
*  next thing to watch on that calendar. All right. Let's go through our tour of elections, Ben. So [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2154.48s)]
*  let's start in the UK. We are now a couple of weeks back while I was off. British Prime Minister [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2159.52s)]
*  Rishi Sunak made a surprise announcement that the UK's general election would take place on July 4th, [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2165.2000000000003s)]
*  a day famously associated with success for the British Empire. That tight timeline came as a [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2171.12s)]
*  surprise to a lot of people because things are not going well for Sunak's conservative Tory party. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2176.96s)]
*  A recent poll had them trailing Labour by 17 points. Imagine being up by 17 points. Yeah. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2182.0s)]
*  That's so sweet. That's nice. Sunak's announcement of this news was befitting of a party getting its [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2187.2799999999997s)]
*  ass handed to them by double digits. Let's hear a clip. I came to office above all to restore [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2193.52s)]
*  economic stability. Economic stability is the bedrock of any future success, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2199.04s)]
*  whether that is rising wages and good jobs, investment in our public services, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2205.6s)]
*  or the defence of the country. And because of our collective sacrifice and your hard work, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2210.32s)]
*  we have reached two major milestones in delivering that stability, showing that when we work together, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2216.4s)]
*  anything is possible. I recognise that it has not always been easy. Some of you will only just be [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2222.72s)]
*  starting to feel the benefits, and for some, it might still be hard when you look at your bank [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2228.96s)]
*  balance. But this hard-earned economic stability was only ever meant to be the beginning. The [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2234.08s)]
*  question now is how and who do you trust to turn that foundation into a secure future for you, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2239.92s)]
*  your family, and our country? Now is the moment to... Cut this dork off. I can't see this dork [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2246.96s)]
*  anymore. It just sounds like such a joke. So in the background, you can hear protesters playing [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2253.2000000000003s)]
*  a song called Things Can Only Get Better, which famously was the anthem for the Labour Party's [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2257.92s)]
*  campaign in 1997 when they beat the ever-living shit out of the Tories and tossed them at a party. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2262.96s)]
*  It's also... Sunak's speech starts, he's perfectly dry, and by the end, his speech is soaked through, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2268.0s)]
*  starts dumping rain on him. Then, then, this week, things got even worse for Rishi Sunak when right [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2274.2400000000002s)]
*  wing demagogue Nigel Farage announced that he is going to run for election as a member of parliament [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2280.8s)]
*  and lead the Reform Party, which could split the right-wing vote and hurt the Tories further. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2285.44s)]
*  Here's a clip from Farage. We think this election needs a bit of gingering up. Thus far, it is the [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2290.8s)]
*  dullest, most boring election campaign we have ever seen in our lives. And it's funny because [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2297.76s)]
*  the more the two big party leaders try to be different, the more they actually sound the same. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2303.92s)]
*  For what it's worth, Farage has run seven previous times and tried to get a seat in parliament and [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2311.12s)]
*  lost every time. So, Ben, I thought the conventional wisdom was that Rishi Sunak was going to wait as [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2315.36s)]
*  long as possible to hold the election. He wanted to give the economy time to improve, maybe deliver [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2320.56s)]
*  on some of his policy promises, like stopping the boats. Maybe see if Trump would win our election, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2325.6s)]
*  and then they could argue the Tories would have a better relationship with the Republicans. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2330.8s)]
*  What the hell do you think happened here? Why did they move this up? [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2334.6400000000003s)]
*  I'm just going to go out on a limb, Tommy, and suggest that Rishi Sunak is not a very good [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2338.2400000000002s)]
*  politician. And he might not have the best political sense. They had Boris Johnson, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2341.6s)]
*  while they had Theresa May, who seemed like someone who was a home minister who happened [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2347.2s)]
*  to find herself living in number 10. Then they had Boris Johnson, who was this absolute wrecking [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2353.2s)]
*  ball. Then they had Liz Truss, who was probably the worst prime minister in the history of the [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2357.52s)]
*  United Kingdom. And now they have this guy that is politically clueless, sitting there, getting his [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2362.56s)]
*  ass kicked and handed to him, veering between giveaways to the far right to keep them on side, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2367.68s)]
*  this weird thing to send people to Rwanda, and trying to be this technocrat who's not as crazy [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2374.3999999999996s)]
*  as Liz Truss. Maybe he just got sick of it. But it's also, you and I have been in government [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2379.44s)]
*  during bad economic news. It felt like you get a decent jobs numbers and you send the president [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2387.2799999999997s)]
*  out to give a statement, a seven minute statement that no one's going to pay attention to, that [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2393.52s)]
*  mainly makes you feel better. These kind of minimalist positive economic indicators, he's [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2398.64s)]
*  like, oh, this is it, let's go. But it's pretty clear that Rishi Sunak is not going to be prime [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2403.2s)]
*  minister for much longer. He's about to get his ass handed to him in an historic route. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2409.28s)]
*  And the question is, can labor hold this lead? Frankly, if they do, [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2415.6s)]
*  they'll have a bigger majority than even the Tony Blair one, which is crazy to think about because [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2420.64s)]
*  Tony Blair had, with all respect for Keir Starmer, Tony Blair was more of a charismatic [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2425.44s)]
*  change agent kind of guy. But yeah, we're watching the final implosion of the Tories, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2431.2799999999997s)]
*  which is a very satisfying thing to watch. But the thing we should bear in mind is that the labor [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2438.0s)]
*  majority is going to inherit a fucking mess. So as good as it looks, there's not a lot of money [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2444.64s)]
*  to fix things. The NHS is broke. Britain doesn't know what it is after Brexit. They have all these [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2451.2s)]
*  weird convoluted things like the Rwanda agreement to untangle. But I don't see anything disrupting [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2459.36s)]
*  this labor march to victory. Yeah. And there was another amazing video out this week where [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2465.6s)]
*  Rishi Sunak was doing some sort of campaign event that looked incredibly boring, sitting at a [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2470.48s)]
*  picnic table talking to people about sports next to a river. And then a boat full of Lib Dem party [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2474.64s)]
*  members drove behind him and photobombed him with orange signs that said Lib Dem. Yeah. I mean, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2481.52s)]
*  the energy is clearly with anybody except the Tories. I mean, the one thing that's tripped up [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2485.2s)]
*  labor is they've had, they're kind of purging some of the candidates on the left, the kind of [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2489.92s)]
*  hangover of the party's civil war post-Corbyn. And I think trying to bring that together is the [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2496.96s)]
*  key thing is you hold your side together rather than succumbing to infighting. And that's only [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2504.8s)]
*  even can trip you up. Yeah. This Nigel Farage thing is so annoying. Twitter reminded me that [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2509.92s)]
*  back in 2021, Nigel Farage got on Cameo so he could charge you 87 pounds or whatever to say [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2515.28s)]
*  happy birthday to your brother. And someone had him read a script where he said up the raw, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2521.76s)]
*  which is a phrase used by supporters of the provisional IRA, the most militant wing of [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2526.6400000000003s)]
*  the IRA during the troubles to celebrate them. So good. Get that guy out of the show. Good job, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2532.0800000000004s)]
*  Nigel. Good job, Nigel. Let's move on to India's elections, Ben, where after six weeks of voting, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2537.28s)]
*  there are some early results that are surprisingly bad for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP party. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2542.32s)]
*  So while Modi is still set to win reelection and become the second person ever to start a [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2548.24s)]
*  third term as prime minister of India, the margin of victory is much, much smaller than what Modi's [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2552.3999999999996s)]
*  party had promised. So there's 543 seats in the Indian parliament. You need to secure 272 seats [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2557.4399999999996s)]
*  for majority. The BJP had promised a landslide victory of 400 seats, which would have given them [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2563.52s)]
*  a super majority and allowed Modi to change India's constitution. But the latest results show that the [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2569.68s)]
*  BJP is only likely to win about 240 seats, well short of their goal and down from the 303 seats [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2575.12s)]
*  they won in the last elections in 2019. This means that for the first time in a decade, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2581.68s)]
*  the BJP did not win a majority on its own and will have to rely on other parties to form a [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2586.7999999999997s)]
*  coalition government. That shouldn't be a problem, but it's new. This election was very much a [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2591.7599999999998s)]
*  referendum on Modi himself. He was literally the face on all the campaign posters. He was not shy [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2598.3199999999997s)]
*  about making this a cult of personality. I know while I was out, Ben, you talked to Rana Ayub, [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2603.04s)]
*  amazing, brave journalist who's covered Modi forever. And she pointed out how Modi has been [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2608.4s)]
*  even more brazen and open with his anti-Muslim rhetoric in this campaign. So on the one hand, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2614.16s)]
*  it's great to see this guy get chopped down a peg or two because he's a scary authoritarian. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2619.92s)]
*  On the other hand, it's not great that he's still going to form a coalition with even more right [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2624.64s)]
*  wing parties to form a government. But what do you think this says about Modi's message and [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2628.24s)]
*  staying power? And I know, do you think this gets the US to course correct at all when it comes to [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2632.64s)]
*  pushing back on him or are we still just dependent on India in our own minds at least [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2637.92s)]
*  to push back on China? I think this is like a huge surprise. And part of this is [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2642.48s)]
*  the BJP didn't exactly do a great job of expectation setting. No. Because they did [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2649.92s)]
*  make it seem like this massive landslide was imminent. One of the reasons why people thought [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2654.8799999999997s)]
*  Modi might have cranked up the anti-Muslim rhetoric is because they saw, because it was [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2661.76s)]
*  a six week election, they saw actually that they didn't like the voting exit polls and stuff that [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2666.1600000000003s)]
*  were coming in. But I think the important thing to bear in mind here is that not only has Modi kind [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2671.6800000000003s)]
*  of lost a step, lost momentum that he had been trying to build into this transformation of Indian [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2677.36s)]
*  society, but also the opposition kind of, it definitely hit bottom and pressed back up. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2684.5600000000004s)]
*  Congress party. Congress doubled their seats. A bunch of other parties did well. And so all of [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2691.28s)]
*  a sudden the dynamic has shifted from this sense of a Modi juggernaut rolling over everybody and [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2697.92s)]
*  the opposition collapsing to the opposition's recovering a bit. Modi's losing a bit of altitude. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2702.0800000000004s)]
*  And importantly, Modi is the best asset that the BJP has. It's not like the BJP is more popular [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2706.96s)]
*  than Modi and he happens to be the prime minister. He's dragged his party to new heights [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2714.32s)]
*  and he's in his seventies, not clear that he'll be leading the BJP in the next election. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2721.76s)]
*  There's no clear succession. There's not exactly like the next guy in line, Amit Shah, is kind of [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2728.48s)]
*  like Modi without the charisma, like all the bad autocratic tendencies without any of the kind of [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2733.52s)]
*  public face and charisma. So I think this spells some real trouble for Modi and the BJP in their [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2740.2400000000002s)]
*  kind of transformation agenda and hopefully some of the scarier autocratic scenarios like remaking [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2746.4s)]
*  the constitution. That said, nothing that we know about them suggests that they'll [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2751.12s)]
*  curb their emissions that much. They'll try to cobble together some right-wing coalitions. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2756.16s)]
*  But what it does suggest is they may be facing more pushback. So I'd expect them to push forward, [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2760.3199999999997s)]
*  but I think you'll see some more energized opposition to what they've been doing to kind of [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2765.68s)]
*  make this a soft autocracy. The US, I think it should indicate that the US needs this India [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2771.68s)]
*  strategy that is not entirely Modi centric and Modi kind of dependent and might be more willing [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2778.48s)]
*  to criticize certain actions of Modi's, but I'm not expecting that. It feels like Biden [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2783.92s)]
*  has decided, I'm just doing any trouble with this guy. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2791.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's tough and all that great options. This is a banal observation, but it's wild that the Brits, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2795.36s)]
*  you get to announce an election and it happens six weeks later and then it takes six weeks to [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2802.0s)]
*  vote in India. And for us, we're just trapped in one endless, two loop of an election that in fact [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2807.28s)]
*  has been the same election now for several, several years. For eight years, yeah. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2813.1200000000003s)]
*  Love it. Okay, so we also have some big results in South Africa then where the African National [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2817.52s)]
*  Congress or ANC party, the party that Nelson Mandela was part of, which freed South Africa [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2822.2400000000002s)]
*  from apartheid, fell short of winning 50% of the national vote for the first time in 30 years. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2826.7200000000003s)]
*  So this election, the ANC got about 40%, which is an 18 point decrease from 2019. The ANC now has [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2832.72s)]
*  just a few weeks to forge a coalition government with one of their rival parties. These are the [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2839.7599999999998s)]
*  parties that spent the campaign brutally attacking the ANC as corrupt, and vowing not to work with [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2844.3199999999997s)]
*  them. And now the knives are out for ANC leader and South African president, Cyril Romaphosa, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2849.04s)]
*  who is being blamed for this collapse and his party's support. Former ANC leader, Jacob Zuma, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2855.2s)]
*  also played a huge role in this outcome. Six years ago, Zuma was pushed out of the ANC for [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2860.88s)]
*  corruption. And then six months ago, he started a new political party that got 15% of the vote, [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2866.08s)]
*  which is remarkable. Also remarkable given that this guy spent two months in prison for corruption [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2871.36s)]
*  back in 2021 and was accused of much worse things. Yeah, he was acquitted, but yeah. So Ben, [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2876.0s)]
*  it's not clear how this will shake out what will happen next. And there's a lot of South Africans, [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2882.4s)]
*  I think, are understandably concerned about adding political instability to the long list [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2887.68s)]
*  of challenges the country is facing. But I guess the broader question is, is this the end of an [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2891.6s)]
*  era for the ANC in South Africa? It certainly feels like it, right? And so the ANC party, [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2897.04s)]
*  Nelson Mandela, the party that delivers liberation, sweeps into power under Mandela with this massive, [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2902.56s)]
*  massive majority, and have dominated South African politics ever since. But it's been a kind of slow, [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2908.16s)]
*  steady deterioration because all the worst things that can happen in one party dominance happened [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2914.0s)]
*  in the sense that there are patronage networks and corruption and everybody's trading favors, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2921.9199999999996s)]
*  and the people are getting older and they weren't letting younger people come up to the ranks. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2927.9199999999996s)]
*  And so for a lot of reasons, ANC has been part of the political and economic paralysis, [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2932.48s)]
*  where they haven't solved problems like inequality. If you look at South African data, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2936.8799999999997s)]
*  yes, apartheid's over, but income inequality is pretty comparable. And so people had a lot of good [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2942.08s)]
*  reasons to be pissed off. And so I think the ANC is going to continue to be the leading player, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2949.76s)]
*  but they're going to have to kind of, I think, whether they choose to do so now or later depends [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2956.7200000000003s)]
*  to be seen, but they're going to have to kind of reimagine who they are. They can't just keep dining [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2962.48s)]
*  out on, hey, we're the ones that ended apartheid. And Xuma was part of that degradation too, so he's [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2966.96s)]
*  not the answer. You need to give some space for younger people to either take over the ANC [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2974.7200000000003s)]
*  or for younger people to start these other parties to kind of move to the forefront. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2980.32s)]
*  So there may be some dysfunction for a while, but I think ultimately it's to the good for there to [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2984.2400000000002s)]
*  be a regeneration. The other thing I'd say to just connect all these is it's kind of interesting to [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2988.64s)]
*  me, Tommy, the Tories, the BJP and the ANC are all very different parties. It seems like people are [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=2993.36s)]
*  not happy with incumbents around the world. And maybe that, like I think cost of living issues, [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3000.1600000000003s)]
*  that may not bode well for Joe Biden, because if we can see one trend, it's just kind of like a [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3007.84s)]
*  loss of altitude for incumbent political parties. Yeah, a lot of like burn it down sentiment around [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3015.04s)]
*  the world. Last topic before we get to the interview with Dan about Mexico. So listeners [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3020.0s)]
*  probably know- By the way, that's an exception to the Bernadon rule. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3025.12s)]
*  That's true. Yeah, she was obviously- [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3027.52s)]
*  Cognitive. Yeah, and Amal has been very popular in part because he's delivered on these social [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3028.88s)]
*  programs. Listeners know that we usually try to close it out with something lighter, [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3033.04s)]
*  give you guys a laugh after 45 minutes of shitty global news. It's not often that we source these [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3038.72s)]
*  stories out of North Korea, but today we're going to try. So is anyone who has followed the passive [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3044.24s)]
*  aggressive flag raising at the Alito household knows there are many ways to deal with a shitty [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3050.4799999999996s)]
*  neighbor. But North Korea has taken a creative and fresh approach that really caught our eye. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3055.6s)]
*  Over the past week, they have launched over 1000 balloons filled with cigarette butts and other [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3061.52s)]
*  trash across the border into South Korea, which they claim totals about 15 tons, 15 tons of balloon [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3067.6s)]
*  trash dumped in South Korea. So the office of the president of South Korea called the balloons, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3074.72s)]
*  quote, dirty provocations no normal country would think of. True. And as a result has rescinded a [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3080.08s)]
*  2018 deal that limited hostile activity at the border. That means that South Korea is now free [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3086.0s)]
*  to take what it calls unbearable measures in response against the North. The terminology is [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3092.56s)]
*  so great. All this just makes me miss working with Danny Russell and him sending us his favorite [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3098.48s)]
*  classified North Korean propaganda stuff. Anyway, so those measures include resuming loud speaker [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3103.2s)]
*  broadcasts into North Korea of criticism to their human rights record, world news reports, [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3109.44s)]
*  and then K-pop songs, which I guess is called a vicious cancer. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3115.6s)]
*  I don't maybe you could explain this to me. I don't totally get how blasting wildly popular [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3122.08s)]
*  music back at someone is kind of like the tat for the tit of sending tons of cigarette butts into [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3126.88s)]
*  my house. But what do you make of this? Yeah, I it's a bit like, you know, if you have like a [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3132.64s)]
*  neighbor, I'm not suggesting this always happened to me. And like you get in one of these kind of [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3140.8s)]
*  weird disputes where they're like not taking their trash out or they're doing like work on the house. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3144.24s)]
*  And so then you in a passive aggressive way start playing your music really loud. I mean, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3149.04s)]
*  this kind of just it does just kind of feel like a really ugly fight between neighbors. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3153.04s)]
*  If it wasn't like a nuclear flashpoint, it'd be funnier. I mean, I think what is interesting is [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3158.56s)]
*  there's a kind of, you know, the tell is you learn something about both sides. So like the North [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3166.0s)]
*  Korean tactic is just kind of pure thuggery, you know, like, like we're just going to dump [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3173.04s)]
*  our shit on you like quite literally. And then the South Korean tactic is like, we're going to [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3178.08s)]
*  like demonstrate our like cultural supremacy. Like we've got K-pop here, we've got like, you know, [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3183.36s)]
*  broadcasts about what's really happening in the world. I mean, I remember when we were in government, [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3187.84s)]
*  you heard that some of the most effective, you know, cultural, whatever you want to call it, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3192.7200000000003s)]
*  like propaganda or, or impactful human rights messaging in North Korea was smuggled copies of [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3199.04s)]
*  South Korean soap operas. Yeah, like thumb drives of it. So yeah, [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3207.36s)]
*  because by the way, this wasn't the US government doing is just like people wanted to watch these [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3210.56s)]
*  South Korean soap operas. And the reason why is because the North Koreans have been taught [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3213.84s)]
*  their whole lives about how awful and what a wasteland the capitalist world is. And people [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3219.7599999999998s)]
*  have no access to information. And so people were watching soap operas and really, well, [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3226.0s)]
*  wait a second, that apartment looks pretty nice. Yeah, those people are eating in the soap opera, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3228.88s)]
*  you know, like we were told that the capitalists had no food, we were told that they lived on the [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3233.44s)]
*  street in destitution, you know, see a shot of the skyline of Seoul and you're like, what? [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3237.68s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. This happened. So that's why I think the K-pop is actually a good, [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3241.2s)]
*  you know, like anything that kind of illustrates like actually, like, you know, this system over [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3244.32s)]
*  here, we're not going to just lecture you about democracy, we're going to show you like, we can [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3247.6s)]
*  produce K-pop and we can like, you know, live this nice life in Seoul and look at the, you know, [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3252.08s)]
*  look the food we have over here like that to me, you know, but it does, I mean, the serious point [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3257.2s)]
*  is tension seem to be ratcheting up. And I think Kim Jong-un feels like, you know, he probably got [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3262.88s)]
*  some sweet deal from Putin, you know, in exchange for artillery, he's getting a bunch of stuff. And [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3269.04s)]
*  so that the worrying thing is that he seems to just be, you know, pushing the envelope. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3273.2s)]
*  He's feeling himself a little bit. Yeah. So let's see some big speakers [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3276.88s)]
*  to blast off K-pop all the way. Yeah. Yeah. And is there friendly fire? Like, what if you live in [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3280.88s)]
*  South Korea on that side of the border? Are you just hearing- Is Rick rolling back? Yeah. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3287.12s)]
*  Something? I don't know. We're going to take a quick break, but stick around when we get back [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3292.16s)]
*  to hear Dan Restrepo talk about Mexico's historic election results. The Mexican elections wrapped [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3295.6800000000003s)]
*  up this weekend in Claudia Shane Baum, a protege of the current president, Andres Manuel Lopez [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3300.88s)]
*  Obrador was overwhelmingly elected as the country's first female president. Joining me [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3305.76s)]
*  to discuss what we might expect from her is Dan Restrepo. My old friend, former colleague on the [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3311.0400000000004s)]
*  national security staff at the White House. Dan was the principal advisor to President Obama [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3316.8s)]
*  on all things related to Latin America. You had my favorite title in the whole place, Dan. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3321.76s)]
*  You were in charge of the Western hemisphere, which is like, there's nothing sweeping massive. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3325.5200000000004s)]
*  He is currently a founding partner at Dinamica Americas, an advisory group. So Dan, thank you [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3330.5600000000004s)]
*  so much for being here. Let's start with Claudia Shane Baum herself. So she will be the first woman [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3335.44s)]
*  to serve as Mexico's president. She's also the first Jewish president of Mexico. Can you tell [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3339.6s)]
*  us a little more about who she is, her background, and just how historic it is for Mexico to elect [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3344.56s)]
*  its first female president? Certainly. It's quite historic. You have a country that is kind of known [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3349.84s)]
*  for its machismo, electing a woman president of the country. You have a wildly, predominantly [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3355.04s)]
*  Catholic country electing a Jew as president of the country. You have a woman who was a very [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3360.72s)]
*  capable technocrat as mayor of Mexico City, that she served as mayor of Mexico City for most of [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3367.3599999999997s)]
*  the last six years. She had to step down to run for the presidency. She's a climate scientist by [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3371.8399999999997s)]
*  training. She's part of a Nobel Prize winning climate team, worked at the United Nations, [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3376.8799999999997s)]
*  has been educated outside of Mexico, but at the same time is a Mexican nationalist. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3383.8399999999997s)]
*  She has allowed very little daylight during the course of this presidential campaign between [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3390.56s)]
*  her political patron, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the outgoing president. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3397.68s)]
*  So she's a bit of an enigma, despite the fact that she just won the largest number of votes [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3402.0s)]
*  anyone has legitimately won in Mexican political history. So there's a lot that we're all going [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3406.64s)]
*  to find out about what she actually believes and how she's going to govern once she takes office [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3412.48s)]
*  on October 1st. Yeah, I mean, you hit it something that I keep seeing over and over again, which is [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3418.4s)]
*  every article, every analysis piece about Shane Baum says something like this election is historic. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3423.52s)]
*  It's just seismic for Mexico, but she's a bit of a black box in terms of her policy views, [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3429.28s)]
*  in terms of how she'll govern. I mean, do analysts think she'll be represent more of a continuation [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3434.48s)]
*  of AMLO's administration, something different, or we just don't know? [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3441.12s)]
*  So there's going to be a fair amount of continuity, certainly kind of policy continuity. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3444.88s)]
*  Both of them, both Lopez Obrador and Shane Baum, kind of believe in Mexico for Mexicans, [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3450.32s)]
*  very much kind of a Mexico first approach to how the country should be governed. They believe in [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3457.2000000000003s)]
*  a very active role of the public sector in the economy, so the kind of statist approach. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3463.28s)]
*  She believes kind of more in a competition stance, his, what was a more combative stance [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3468.48s)]
*  between the public and private sectors on the economic side. But fundamentally, there's a lot [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3474.56s)]
*  we just don't know about how she's going to govern because she's so disciplined in her approach and [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3480.4s)]
*  because Lopez Obrador has occupied so much political space in Mexico, not just in the last six years, [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3487.92s)]
*  but certainly kind of on Mexico's kind of non-establishment. He's occupied a lot of [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3494.56s)]
*  space for at least 12, kind of almost 15 years. And so we're passing from a moment where he has [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3500.48s)]
*  been the dominant political figure, she's going to come to office. And kind of the sorting out of the [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3508.32s)]
*  relationship between the two of them, quite frankly, is I think one of the kind of known unknowns, [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3513.76s)]
*  to paraphrase Don Rumsfeld. Our old friend Don Rumsfeld. You wrote this great analysis [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3519.04s)]
*  piece of this election for the Center for American Progress. And you noted that in addition to the [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3525.36s)]
*  presidential election, there were tons and tons of regional elections, something like 20,000 seats [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3530.24s)]
*  were up for grabs across the country. It looks like the Morena party, Shane Bonds party, is on [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3535.92s)]
*  track to have super majorities in both houses of Congress and about three quarters of the [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3542.32s)]
*  governorships, I believe. Is Mexico just fully on a path to one party rule? It's really interesting. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3547.2s)]
*  So in my lifetime, I'm a little bit older than you tell me, but in my lifetime, we've seen Mexico, [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3552.96s)]
*  really in kind of my professional career, I've seen a Mexico that was a one party state, [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3557.9199999999996s)]
*  a one party state for 70 years and the anti-democratic one at that transition to a [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3562.48s)]
*  competitive democracy. In 2000, you have the first kind of legitimate transfer of power. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3567.2799999999997s)]
*  You have three elections that take place where there's kind of the electorate is divided in [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3572.4s)]
*  thirds. And then in 2018, Lopez Obrador comes along and wins a majority of the vote in what [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3577.04s)]
*  was surprising then. And now you have what Morena did on Sunday, which Shane Bonds had had a pretty [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3584.0s)]
*  significant lead in the polls throughout. There was always the question of how accurate the polls [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3591.6s)]
*  were, but she outperformed even the most kind of optimistic polls. And they really had a very good [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3596.4s)]
*  day. But I think the better way of thinking about it is the old Mexican political establishment had [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3602.24s)]
*  a horrific day and has kind of collapsed under its own weight and under the weight of Lopez Obrador [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3607.4399999999996s)]
*  kind of beating on it for the last six years. And so yet we might be on the verge of Mexico, [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3614.3199999999997s)]
*  kind of the pendulum swinging back. We certainly have a Mexico where you have a politically [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3621.52s)]
*  dominant party, which is Morena, an electorally consolidated party in a way that I think surprised [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3626.64s)]
*  some. The real question is going to be how consolidated it is governing going forward, [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3633.7599999999998s)]
*  because that was the trick under the kind of one party state. The party was a very institutionalized [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3640.24s)]
*  thing and was the instrument of power in the country. Morena is not that yet. And whether [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3646.16s)]
*  they can consolidate it that way is one of the big questions for these six years going forward. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3654.4s)]
*  Yeah. So Dan, I mean, Omlod gets credit for lifting millions of people out of poverty with [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3659.44s)]
*  social programs, but he's often criticized in the same breath for failing to curb the power of drug [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3664.88s)]
*  cartels, failing to reduce gang violence across the country, et cetera. I mean, even this campaign [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3670.88s)]
*  season was incredibly violent. At least 15 candidates for office died after the campaigning [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3676.56s)]
*  started last October, including several who were just straight up gunned down by what I guess were [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3682.88s)]
*  assassins. How do you think we should judge his tenure in office and how do the people [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3688.32s)]
*  of Mexico view him now that he's departing the scene? [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3696.1600000000003s)]
*  So it's complicated in terms of kind of the objective take on what López [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3699.6s)]
*  Obrador has represented in Mexico. As you rightly point out, and quite frankly, I think as Sunday's [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3703.6800000000003s)]
*  result points out, he delivered for his core constituency. Mexico is a country of deep poverty, [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3708.72s)]
*  as well as kind of deep integration with the North American economy in kind of very sophisticated [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3716.56s)]
*  ways. But at its core, it's a country that is majority poor. And that's who López Obrador has [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3722.64s)]
*  always fashioned himself as a champion of the dispossessed. And on the kind of pure day-to-day [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3730.48s)]
*  economic well-being of that portion of Mexico, of the majority of Mexicans, López Obrador delivered. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3736.48s)]
*  Basic income in the country today, the minimum wage today in Mexico, in real terms is 116% [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3743.68s)]
*  of what it was when López Obrador took office. So he more than doubled the minimum wage. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3750.88s)]
*  Just by comparison, the previous three governments of the two different parties of now the [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3756.4s)]
*  opposition in the Pena Nieto government, which was immediately before, increased in six years, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3762.0s)]
*  13% in the total of those six years. In the six years before that, it increased half a percent. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3766.64s)]
*  Right? So his ability to deliver on the kind of core economic well-being of kind of day-to-day [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3773.2s)]
*  Mexicans is impressive. The sustainability of it, the kind of transactional nature of it, [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3779.6s)]
*  and how kind of he used it for political purposes is, you know, subject to kind of [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3786.72s)]
*  analysis and criticism. But again, if you view it from the from kind of just grassroots base [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3790.9599999999996s)]
*  population in Mexico, the man delivered, and they in turn delivered for him, him and Morena, [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3797.2799999999997s)]
*  politically this past Sunday. On security, he's been a disaster. Mexico is far more insecure today, [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3803.52s)]
*  and that's saying something because the baseline six years ago wasn't exactly great. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3811.4399999999996s)]
*  Mexico has a real challenge with transnational criminal organizations [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3816.32s)]
*  that have kind of become these diversified enterprises that traffic in kind of anything [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3820.7200000000003s)]
*  you can traffic in. Fed, you know, in no small measure by an iron river of guns that flows out [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3827.52s)]
*  of the United States into Mexico, fueled by the consumption of illegal drugs in the United States [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3833.84s)]
*  and the cash that goes back to these cartels and these organizations. But López Obrador has done [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3841.44s)]
*  very little to confront them, and on that score I think it's pretty clear that he's been a failure [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3847.04s)]
*  as Mexico's president. Interestingly, Claudia Scheinbaum, as mayor of Mexico City, has a pretty [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3853.28s)]
*  good record on security and also has demonstrated a willingness to cooperate with the United States [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3859.04s)]
*  on security in ways that López Obrador, her political mentor, wasn't. So it'll be interesting [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3866.0s)]
*  to see how that plays out as things go forward. Yeah, I mean the cooperation point is so important [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3871.6800000000003s)]
*  because again, AMLO and Trump, they had sort of like a weird bromance thing, right? I mean Trump [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3876.64s)]
*  talks about him favorably still to this day. I don't know exactly how to characterize the Biden-AMLO [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3881.52s)]
*  relationship. Like at times they seem to get along, and then AMLO would flip out about a [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3887.2000000000003s)]
*  press report in demand and apology from Biden about something ProPublica had reported, that [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3892.4s)]
*  that literally happened I think maybe a couple times. What do you expect in terms of the US-Mexico [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3896.64s)]
*  relationship under Scheinbaum? I mean, would you expect continuity in terms of cooperation on like [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3904.32s)]
*  core issues? On core issues, yes. I think the question of kind of how noisy the relationship [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3910.0s)]
*  will be depends in large measure on what we do here in November. Whether Claudia Scheinbaum [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3916.32s)]
*  has to deal with Donald Trump or if she gets the opportunity to spend four years with Joe Biden. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3922.4s)]
*  Those would be two different relationships, certainly from an atmospherics perspective and [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3929.44s)]
*  kind of a surround sound perspective. I think the kind of understanding, I think Claudia Scheinbaum [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3933.6800000000003s)]
*  understands that Mexico's economic destiny is tied to the United States. We'll have a review of the [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3938.96s)]
*  USMCA, the trade agreement among the United States, Canada, and Mexico. It's up for formal review in [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3945.36s)]
*  2026. That's going to be all about China's role in Mexico's economy at some level. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3951.6s)]
*  But I think Scheinbaum understands that that's where Mexico's economic well-being lies is being [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3959.2s)]
*  closely tied to the United States. Migration will continue to be a friction point and a point of the [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3966.08s)]
*  need for real cooperation. Guns and drugs, as I mentioned a second ago, will continue to be a [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3972.4s)]
*  friction point. But the US and Mexico are so kind of intimately connected day in and day out [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3977.76s)]
*  that almost despite the personalities and despite the surround sound, the need for continuity, [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3985.6000000000004s)]
*  I think, kind of overwhelms even the kind of personal proclivities of either US or Mexican [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3992.6400000000003s)]
*  leaders. It is so funny to imagine going from a US-Mexico relationship that was dominated by the [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=3998.0800000000004s)]
*  loudest voices imaginable. Donald Trump, everybody here knows, but then down in Mexico, you had AMLO [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4003.76s)]
*  doing these, what, like hour and a half long press conferences, what, daily at times? [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4010.1600000000003s)]
*  Daily. No, no, no, not at times. Daily. Monday through Friday, six years. He does it every day [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4014.0800000000004s)]
*  and he's on from at least two hours every morning. Attacking reporters by name, demagoguing people, [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4021.36s)]
*  like kind of reading cell phone numbers, putting people at risk. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4028.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, doxing New York Times bureau chief, attacking Supreme Court justices [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4031.04s)]
*  in Mexico, attacking electoral authorities, a kind of constant drumbeat of, and unbelievably [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4036.64s)]
*  effective as a tool or as an instrument of political control. Kind of for our listening [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4044.96s)]
*  purposes, everybody should think of it as kind of the Trump Twitter feed at the peak of its powers. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4051.6s)]
*  Uh-huh. But if it were being handled by somebody who had a coherent plan. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4056.96s)]
*  Oh, that is scary. Yeah, but that's what these two-hour press conferences, [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4061.6s)]
*  they're called maniunitas, his kind of morning press conferences were. He sets the agenda every [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4066.4s)]
*  day. If people, like what the press is going to chase and what everybody's going to be talking [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4071.92s)]
*  about is whatever he rolls out of bed every morning and decides he's going to put on the table [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4076.48s)]
*  between 8 and 10 a.m. every day. That's amazing. Yeah, as you described, [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4081.04s)]
*  I think surround sound, it's going to be so different now. Last question for you is just [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4085.04s)]
*  on immigration, which you also mentioned. I mean, obviously immigration, the southern border, [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4088.96s)]
*  they're the central focus of Donald Trump's campaign. I think if his advisors had their way, [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4092.48s)]
*  they would have him talk about nothing else. In fact, Trump cares about it so much that he killed [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4096.64s)]
*  a bipartisan Senate bill meant to address the challenges of the southern border. Today, Tuesday, [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4101.12s)]
*  June 4th, President Biden announced an executive order that will allow him to essentially shut [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4106.48s)]
*  down the border to asylum seekers at non-official ports of entry once a certain quota has been [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4111.92s)]
*  reached. Dan, you spent years and years of your life working on immigration policy at times, [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4117.76s)]
*  I imagine, to your great frustration. Yes. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4124.4800000000005s)]
*  Do you think this EO is likely to solve the problem? And then really, if not, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4126.4s)]
*  can any step taken via executive order alone solve the problem? [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4132.96s)]
*  Yeah. So I think there's kind of three big takeaways from this executive order. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4137.12s)]
*  The first is that, like all of us, President Biden wants to see order at the border. The kind [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4141.44s)]
*  of chaotic baseline at the U.S.-Mexico border is in no one's interest. It's not in the U.S.'s interest, [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4147.12s)]
*  it's not in Mexico's interest, it's not in the interest of folks legitimately seeking asylum, [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4153.12s)]
*  it's not in the interest of folks migrating for any number of reasons. So the president [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4157.28s)]
*  wants to see order at the border. What's kind of inherent in your question is this, the EO also, [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4162.32s)]
*  I think, underscores that he does not have at his disposal the tools necessary to achieve order at [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4169.2s)]
*  the border. That those tools, the Congress needs to be a part of the solution set here. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4176.32s)]
*  There was a deal on the table that was this plus a bunch of other stuff, and that other stuff is [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4182.96s)]
*  important, that Republicans decided that they would prefer, because Donald Trump decided he [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4187.12s)]
*  would prefer to have this issue, to scuttle it. And I think this is the president kind of, [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4193.84s)]
*  saying very clearly, and you can see it all the language around the EO, [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4201.92s)]
*  like Congress needs to be a part of the solution. Congress has abdicated its responsibility because [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4205.360000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump wants to put himself ahead of U.S. interests, so I'm going to do this. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4210.0s)]
*  The third thing that I think is important to remember, it's unlikely that this is going to [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4215.92s)]
*  survive a legal challenge. This is roughly something that Donald Trump tried doing in 2018. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4220.56s)]
*  It was more extreme, not surprisingly, when Donald Trump tried doing it, but the courts came down [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4227.52s)]
*  pretty quickly and pretty emphatically that the president doesn't have this authority, [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4231.92s)]
*  and that Congress needs to be a part, like if the U.S. wants to do this, it needs to change laws, [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4237.92s)]
*  and it needs to do it through the legislative process. We all want to see order at the border. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4242.8s)]
*  This president has been working not just at the border, which kind of draws all the attention, [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4248.4800000000005s)]
*  but also in the region, because one of the really important things to keep in mind on [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4253.04s)]
*  migration in the Americas. So, Latin America and the Caribbean represent 8% of the world's population, [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4258.32s)]
*  but 25% of the world's displaced population, right? And those numbers sound really scary, [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4263.92s)]
*  and there's this impression in the United States that all of those people are trying to come to [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4269.52s)]
*  the United States. But if you actually stop and look, more than 80% of displaced people in Latin [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4273.12s)]
*  America and the Caribbean over the course of the last decade stay in Latin America and the Caribbean. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4280.8s)]
*  Folks want to be as close to home as they can, and this administration, the Biden administration, [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4285.84s)]
*  has been working with the countries that matter through something called the Los Angeles Declaration [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4291.12s)]
*  on Migration and Protection to help kind of integrate migrants where they are, right? [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4296.48s)]
*  Because we're all a lot better off if people can stay closer to home, and if we're working to [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4302.879999999999s)]
*  incorporate people in communities that want them, that they want to be in, [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4310.5599999999995s)]
*  and kind of avoiding further migration than trying to prevent the last step of migration, [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4316.959999999999s)]
*  which is at the U.S.-Mexico border. Right. I mean, I guess that root cause piece has always [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4322.48s)]
*  been the hardest part of this. I mean, I wonder if you think that Biden has done enough to help, [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4328.4s)]
*  you know. But tell me it's a little different than root cause. Sure. Right. So, root cause is to say, [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4332.639999999999s)]
*  so if you really look at it, there's four countries where most of the migrants in the [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4337.12s)]
*  Western Hemisphere are coming from. Most of them are coming from Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua, and [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4340.4s)]
*  Haiti. Right. Right? A root cause strategy says you have to fix Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Haiti, [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4345.12s)]
*  right? Good luck. Right. Those countries are not easy fixes there. But take the example of [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4352.24s)]
*  Venezuela. So, Venezuela, since 2015, almost 8 million, 7.7 million Venezuelans have left [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4358.639999999999s)]
*  Venezuela, right? From a population, a starting population of 32 million. So, a quarter of the [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4365.28s)]
*  country since 2015 has left the country. Three million of them, right? Almost half of that number [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4370.5599999999995s)]
*  live right next door. Right. Live in Colombia. Colombia, yeah. Right? And so, the idea here is, [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4378.0s)]
*  okay, so the Colombians have been wildly successful in helping Venezuelans stay closer to home. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4382.96s)]
*  So, we should help the Colombians do that. And we should help the Ecuadorians and others. So, [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4388.8s)]
*  this is how do you help kind of what the region is already doing successfully is to integrate these [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4395.84s)]
*  new populations in a way that actually ends up being economically beneficial. And so, [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4402.16s)]
*  the administration actually, I think, has been doing, they don't particularly tell the story [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4407.2s)]
*  particularly well, but they've been doing a bunch of work in this space. And that's how, ultimately, [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4410.72s)]
*  that plus legal pathways plus some enforcement, that's how you get to the order at the border [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4416.4s)]
*  that we all want to see. No, that makes total sense. And yeah, of course, I mean, your average [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4421.92s)]
*  person, no one wants to travel thousands and thousands of miles and pay a smuggler and endanger [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4425.28s)]
*  their family. Right? No one wants to do that, of course. You'd much rather stay in Bogota or [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4431.68s)]
*  someplace in Colombia if you're in Venezuela. I do wonder, hopefully, the politics will allow [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4436.0s)]
*  the Biden administration to do more to maybe help reduce sanctions or stop doing some of the things [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4441.6s)]
*  that are hurting the economy in Venezuela, causing people to leave. Although, of course, [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4449.04s)]
*  I'm not blaming it on them, obviously. Maduro is the root cause of this. But an enormous challenge, [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4452.240000000001s)]
*  I think you're right though, the secutive order, it might not last very long. That's sort of the [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4456.96s)]
*  problem here. This might be more about campaign optics than policy solutions. Yeah. And again, [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4460.96s)]
*  it underscores that a president, the solution here is not a president acting alone. There's no, [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4467.04s)]
*  I alone can fix this. This is a complex set of dynamics that require complex, thoughtful solutions. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4474.56s)]
*  And that requires the United States Congress, and particularly the Republican Party and the [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4484.32s)]
*  United States Congress, to engage in complex thought, which is not exactly their strong suit. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4488.16s)]
*  And when they do, Donald Trump sweeps in and says, stop that thinking. And tells them, stop that. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4493.5199999999995s)]
*  Dear leader, as giving an order. Yes. Well, listen, Dan, thank you so much for talking [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4499.12s)]
*  through all this. I really appreciate it and great to see you, man. Certainly. Thank you very much. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4504.5599999999995s)]
*  Thanks again, Dan Restrepo, for joining the show. Good to be back, man. Sorry about my Celtics [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4508.48s)]
*  making it in. Yeah, I was looking forward to losing to the Celtics. I mean, I never expected [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4513.6s)]
*  to beat the Celtics, but I thought Eastern Conference finals for the first time in the [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4518.400000000001s)]
*  21st century would be nice for the Knicks. But apparently we can't have nice things. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4522.320000000001s)]
*  You weren't really gone. I mean, I heard you- I know it was weird. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4527.200000000001s)]
*  It was because Lovett is- Live, laugh, love it. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4530.64s)]
*  I want to, like hearing you guys make fun of Lovett, I want to introduce something that I [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4533.52s)]
*  have not heard, which is, presumably he's in a foreign country, right? [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4537.92s)]
*  He's in like Fiji and apparently it's been dumping rain and cold. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4542.08s)]
*  But is it good for American foreign relations to have John Lovett in another country? Like, [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4545.5199999999995s)]
*  might he cause an international incident? Is he like our K-pop balloon? [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4550.24s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. I mean, like Fiji is now a strategic, you know, it's important country in [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4554.32s)]
*  the US China dispute over the Pacific. Yeah, we're pivoting. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4560.16s)]
*  Something tells me that Lovett is probably not advancing the cause of, you know, the Chinese [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4563.2s)]
*  would be smart to come in after Lovett and just sweep up, you know. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4567.28s)]
*  Foreign relations? Yeah. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4571.5199999999995s)]
*  It is just so weird that we have no idea what has been going on in his life for a month. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4572.5599999999995s)]
*  Someone you see every day, all day, just disappears. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4577.12s)]
*  Well, he's doing his own version of the anxiety reduction program. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4579.84s)]
*  The midlife crisis reduction program. Yeah, exactly. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4584.32s)]
*  We'll see. But again, thanks again for giving me- yeah, I was sort of partially off, [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4587.04s)]
*  came in once a week to do Pots A of America. Not ideal, but you know, it's fine. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4591.12s)]
*  We know your heart is truly with Pots A of the World. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4595.44s)]
*  I know. I love doing this show. Last week was like a nerd fest. We had [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4597.44s)]
*  three guests. It was like, you know, it was crazy. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4603.5199999999995s)]
*  You're like a pig in shit. Yeah, exactly. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4606.88s)]
*  Well, it's good to be back and talk to you guys next week. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97YsuDqq7KE&t=4610.16s)]
