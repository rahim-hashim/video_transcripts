Video Description: Tommy Vietor and Ben Rhodes discuss how Trump’s nomination of Pete Hegseth and Tulsi Gabbard could reshape and politicize the US military and intelligence community, and how Trump’s choice to lead the FBI will signal how intensely he plans to go after his political enemies. They also talk about Biden’s decision to allow Ukraine to hit targets in Russia with US-made weapons, the dark irony of COP29 being held in Azerbaijan, Biden’s trip to the G20 and APEC, Brazil’s sports gambling crisis, and a serious case of banana-phobia. Then Tommy speaks to Senator Bernie Sanders about his effort in Congress to ban offensive weapons sales to Israel.

# Trump Plots MAGA Military Purge with Fox News Host in Charge
**Pod Save the World:** [November 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA)
*  Welcome back to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Ben Rhodes. Ben, you think Aaron Rogers is going to leave [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=0.0s)]
*  the Jets and go work for RFK Jr. now? Well, I thought he would be in the running for CDC. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  But I see that Dr. Oz is in there. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=11.36s)]
*  I mean, Aaron Rogers, instead of working out clearly to be the Jets quarterback last couple years, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=14.16s)]
*  he's just kind of been doing his own research. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=18.32s)]
*  But he lost out to Dr. Oz. Our country's such a joke. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=21.04s)]
*  Multiple reality show. We have president, we have reality show cabinet members, Fox News hosts. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  Okay, here we are. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=31.040000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Well, let's just say that our country is about as functional right now as the Jets. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=33.04s)]
*  So it's kind of some parallels there. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=39.52s)]
*  Yeah, basically Woody Johnson running the show. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  This week, we've got a great show for you guys. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  We're going to talk all about the latest news on Trump's national security team. The selections since last week have been interesting to say the least. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  We'll talk about Biden's major policy change on Ukraine, the UN climate summit happening in Azerbaijan, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=53.6s)]
*  President Biden's trip to the G20 in APEC in Brazil and sports gambling in Brazil. Pretty amazing story there, Ben. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=59.44s)]
*  And then you'll hear my interview with Senator Bernie Sanders about his efforts in the Senate to cut off arms to Israel. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=66.72s)]
*  Basically, Sanders has introduced all these resolutions [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=74.0s)]
*  trying to cut off US shipments of specific weapon systems and force a vote on those in the US Senate. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=77.78s)]
*  So very glad he is doing that, Ben. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=84.02s)]
*  Yeah, I know. It'd be interesting to see how many votes that gets. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=85.86s)]
*  I mean, obviously you would like the Democratic caucus to be united behind it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=88.82s)]
*  It probably won't be, but it'll be a good measure of kind of [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=92.66s)]
*  where Democrats are on this. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=95.46s)]
*  You know, clearly not where they need to be, but I'm glad Bernie's leading it. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=98.25999999999999s)]
*  I'm glad Bernie's leading it. I would bet you [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=101.22s)]
*  lots and lots of money that Senate leadership is whipping against these votes, but we shall see. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=103.86s)]
*  But you'll also like the interview, I think was the shortest interview I've ever done in Pod Save the World history. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=109.53999999999999s)]
*  I think it was nine minutes because Bernie is to the point. He is concise. We're in, we're out, and that's why we love him. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=114.66s)]
*  Hey, he's efficient, you know. He's got something to say. He says it and then he's done with his business, you know. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=120.42s)]
*  He's got things to do, votes to cast. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=125.78s)]
*  All right. So last week we talked about the Trump national security team picks that had been made so far. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=128.5s)]
*  I think the takeaway was like they were surprisingly normal, traditional, hawkish Republicans, people like Marco Rubio. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=134.82s)]
*  And then we recorded and then everything changed then. So now we've got Fox and Friends weekend co-host Pete Hegseth [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=142.18s)]
*  nominated to be Secretary of Defense. Tulsi Gabbard was tapped to be the Director of National Intelligence. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=149.62s)]
*  Kash Patel is reportedly a front runner to become the next director of the FBI. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=155.38s)]
*  He might report into future Attorney General Matt Gaetz. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=160.01999999999998s)]
*  And then Politico says Seb Gorka is on the short list to become Deputy National Security Advisor. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=163.78s)]
*  So God help us all. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=170.1s)]
*  Okay, Ben, so let's talk about a few of these goobers in depth starting with Pete Hegseth. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=172.1s)]
*  So he is 44 years old, served in the National Guard for 20 years, served in Iraq and Afghanistan, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=176.42s)]
*  and was awarded two Bronze Stars for his service. Hegseth is a graduate of Princeton University. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=182.89999999999998s)]
*  He got a master's in public policy from Harvard. He served as the Director of two Veterans Advocacy Organizations, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=187.29999999999998s)]
*  which were pretty small. I think he managed like five to 50 people is what I've seen reported. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=194.17999999999998s)]
*  But most of his career in the last decade has been at Fox News. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=198.89999999999998s)]
*  He has railed, you know, as a Fox host, he's railed against wokeness in the military. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=202.89999999999998s)]
*  He suggested banning women from serving in combat roles. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=207.7s)]
*  He's talked about firing the current Chairman of the Joint Chief C.Q. Brown. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=210.42000000000002s)]
*  He wants to abandon all efforts to diversify the military. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=214.02s)]
*  He lobbied Trump to pardon war criminals. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=217.06s)]
*  And according to the Washington Post, Hegseth paid hush money to a woman who accused him of sexual assault. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=219.54000000000002s)]
*  If confirmed, Hegseth would be in charge of managing 2.3 million people, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=225.22s)]
*  including about 1.3 million active duty members in the military. He'll be Trump's primary advisor on defense policy. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=229.86s)]
*  And he would assume even more power in the event of a crisis or a national emergency, real or manufactured. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=236.26000000000002s)]
*  Let's hear a clip of Hegseth from a podcast interview recently on the Sean Ryan show. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=243.22s)]
*  Well, first of all, you got to fire. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=248.82s)]
*  You know, you got to fire the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and you got to fire this. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=251.06s)]
*  I mean, obviously you're going to bring in a new Secretary of Defense, but any general that was involved, general admiral, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=253.54000000000002s)]
*  whatever that was involved in any of the DEI woke shit, it's got to go. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=257.78000000000003s)]
*  Either you're in for war fighting that and that's it. That's the only litmus test we care about. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=262.42s)]
*  You got to get DEI and CRT out of military academy. So you're not training young officers to be baptized in this type of thinking. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=268.5s)]
*  And then, you know, whatever the standards, whatever the combat standards were, say, and I don't know, 1995, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=274.74s)]
*  let's just make those the standards. And as far as recruiting, hire the guy that, you know, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=280.42s)]
*  did Top Gun Maverick and create some real ads that motivate people to want to serve. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=285.14000000000004s)]
*  So let's just go back in time and emulate a movie. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=289.22s)]
*  All right, let's talk about this guy. So I think clearly there's a part of this where Trump just like hires people [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=291.7s)]
*  he thinks look the part and he said, Heg said this is like a central casting guy. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=296.98s)]
*  But he also, he's clearly an ideologue and Trump reportedly wants to purge military leaders who don't agree with him. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=301.14s)]
*  And then according to NBC, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=307.78s)]
*  they might even potentially court martial military officers involved in the withdrawal from Afghanistan. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=309.94s)]
*  NBC even said they're considering charges as serious as treason. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=315.3s)]
*  So, you know, long story short, like a [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=318.82s)]
*  very serious job in a dangerous pick. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=321.86s)]
*  The question I have for you is how Democrats should manage this one because obviously [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=324.98s)]
*  this guy shouldn't be nominated for this position. But I do worry there's a trap here for Democrats. If we insist [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=330.58s)]
*  that, you know, this Princeton Harvard educated combat veteran who wants to shake stuff up is not qualified, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=337.86s)]
*  but that a bunch of blobby [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=345.06s)]
*  DC, you know, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=347.22s)]
*  goobers who are part of the post 9-11 war on terror have the right experience. So just thinking about how to frame this [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=349.3s)]
*  conversation and not, you know, walk ourselves into a trap here. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=356.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think I'd make a broad point about this team and then about Heg-Zeth himself. The broad point is they really know what they're doing. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=359.7s)]
*  They really know what they're doing. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=367.38s)]
*  You know, you look at this from the outside and it's easy to laugh at individual appointments, but let's think about what they're doing. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=369.06s)]
*  The agencies and we'll get to these, but the agencies that Trump hates and wants to wreck are DOJ, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=375.06s)]
*  FBI, the intelligence community that where he has this kind of personal grievances. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=381.76s)]
*  And so we'll get to those people, but that's who he put there. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=386.58000000000004s)]
*  You know, Rubio, you know, the state, you know, he wants state to function. He doesn't seem to have it in for them. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=389.3s)]
*  You could have a conventional guy there. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=395.06s)]
*  Frankly, as we talked about last week, Rubio is not really going to be running foreign policy anyways. He's going to be running out of the White House. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=397.38s)]
*  What is Heg-Zeth there for? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=402.26s)]
*  They want to turn the U.S. military into an extension of MAGA. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=404.34s)]
*  That's something that Trump has always wanted. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=408.65999999999997s)]
*  He's wanted a military that would follow his orders no matter how extreme those orders are. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=410.65999999999997s)]
*  He wants a military that kind of culturally reflects the people at his rallies. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=415.06s)]
*  That's why he liked Heg-Zeth's advocacy for Eddie Gallagher, the Navy SEAL who committed war crimes that Trump pardoned. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=420.18s)]
*  So this isn't just because he looked good on Fox and Friends. It's because of all this stuff he says like in those clips. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=426.98s)]
*  And in terms of what I'd focus on then, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=433.06s)]
*  you guys covered the the sexual assault piece on on PSA. Well, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=436.34s)]
*  obviously that should feature. But what I'd be looking at is [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=441.29999999999995s)]
*  how far are you willing to go [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=444.58s)]
*  to follow those orders? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=447.21999999999997s)]
*  So in other words, what does he think about the use of the U.S. military in the United States for either mass deportations [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=448.41999999999996s)]
*  or for kind of crushing if there are protests that are against Trump? That's a huge issue. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=455.7s)]
*  That's a Rubicon that could be crossed using the U.S. military inside this country in a way [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=462.18s)]
*  it hasn't been done before. And I want to know about that. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=466.74s)]
*  Where you connect a sexual assault to the anti-woke agenda, is this guy going to come in and [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=470.26000000000005s)]
*  roll back all the efforts to you know, women now serve in combat roles, women now serve in leadership roles. Is that all [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=476.18s)]
*  gone? Is he going to kind of claw that back as well? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=483.3s)]
*  And in terms of gutting the kind of senior officer corps, again that gets to the MAGA point is [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=486.5s)]
*  if you're the litmus test for being a three or four star general is fealty to Donald Trump, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=492.34s)]
*  that is remaking the American military in ways that will have a generational impact. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=498.42s)]
*  So what do they mean by this? Who are the people, you know, that are going to [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=503.3s)]
*  be on their radar screen for for Joint Chiefs? You know, I my worry here is that this guy [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=508.9s)]
*  kind of actually knows what he's doing. Yeah, even if he sounds [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=514.9799999999999s)]
*  buffoonish. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=518.56s)]
*  And if we look up in four years, one of the things where Trump can do kind of existential damage [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=519.62s)]
*  is changing the nature and character of the U.S. military in a way that we've never seen before. That's what I'd be focused on. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=525.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's it's worth wondering if he wants to roll back don't ask don't tell and bar [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=530.42s)]
*  gay and lesbian service members from serving because if he wants to go back to 1995, I mean that seems to be a very specific choice. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=536.5799999999999s)]
*  And yeah, but it does seem like there's this broader [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=543.38s)]
*  mission to purge the military and make it [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=546.5799999999999s)]
*  politicized and I think it's incredibly dangerous. Yeah, and and where does it end and what what is the function of the military? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=549.76s)]
*  In that scenario, what happens in terms of cohesion in the military? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=555.86s)]
*  How would you feel in the military right now if you were a woman or if you were a minority? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=559.14s)]
*  Uh, what does that do to morale? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=565.14s)]
*  Um, where recruitment are they just going to go off and recruit, you know, MAGA people? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=567.46s)]
*  Are they going to go off and recruit, you know white nationalists? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=572.26s)]
*  And and I don't say this just because the guy's a tattoo, but that's kind of who they're you know, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=574.58s)]
*  that's who they're kind of putting out the bat signal to and it's a little alarming, you know, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=579.7s)]
*  to think about what that might look like in in four years if this guy does everything he says, uh, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=584.5s)]
*  they're going to do and what does he mean by DEI? I mean because [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=589.3000000000001s)]
*  if there's diversity training, it's it's all over the military. So is everybody involved in that? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=592.66s)]
*  How are they going to select who's you know, quote unquote guilty and not? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=597.3s)]
*  It's a lot of rhetoric that could lead to pretty pretty scary places. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=601.06s)]
*  Yeah, they're so offended by any effort to diversify the military and often what you're talking about is like one hour of training in some [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=604.02s)]
*  like multi-week months course, you know, it's like very very little, uh, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=611.22s)]
*  and there there is a lack of diversity in the u.s military especially at the senior level which [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=615.86s)]
*  Obama and Biden have tried to work on and now it sounds like trump is going to just completely roll back [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=619.94s)]
*  Um, the other pick though that has a lot of people worried is the nomination of former democratic congresswoman tulsi gabard [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=625.22s)]
*  To be the director of national intelligence [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=631.5400000000001s)]
*  Tulsi like hegseth as a veteran [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=633.7800000000001s)]
*  She was in the hawaii army national guard from 2003 to 2020 and has been in the army reserves since 2021 [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=635.7800000000001s)]
*  She also did a 12-month tour in iraq [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=642.1s)]
*  in the house of representatives tulsi served on the homeland security committee [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=644.58s)]
*  But she did not serve on any of the relevant intelligence committees. She's got no experience working at an intelligence agency [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=649.0600000000001s)]
*  I don't think she's managed a large organization as far as I can tell [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=655.7s)]
*  Um, here's a clip of a democratic congresswoman and former cia officer abigail spandberger [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=659.22s)]
*  Talking with our own matt burg from crooked's whataday newsletter about tulsi gabard [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=665.3000000000001s)]
*  nomination [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=670.6400000000001s)]
*  It's just outrageous like like comically outrageous [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=672.4200000000001s)]
*  and [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=677.46s)]
*  And there's not even a figly of a rationale that he can assign to it [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=678.82s)]
*  she [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=684.58s)]
*  Doesn't have an intelligence background. She wasn't on [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=685.38s)]
*  You know the intel committee during her time in congress the dni is a new position that was deemed [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=690.66s)]
*  Newer a that was deemed essential after the september 11th of pep [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=697.38s)]
*  Right. It was created to ensure communication within the ic [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=702.58s)]
*  It was created to ensure a you know a streamlining of information to the president [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=707.6999999999999s)]
*  What happens if we have a dni who's not? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=713.2199999999999s)]
*  So interested in protecting america's secrets or who's not so interested in protecting the kind of legitimacy of american leadership on the global stage [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=715.78s)]
*  the amount of damage that could be done [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=725.3s)]
*  to [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=728.5799999999999s)]
*  our [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=730.42s)]
*  Ability to protect ourselves our ability to do stress on the global stage [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=732.02s)]
*  I mean, it's it is just an it's an untold [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=736.9s)]
*  uh reality [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=740.82s)]
*  So, you know tulsi ran for president as a democrat in 2020 [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=742.4200000000001s)]
*  Then she quit the democratic party a couple years later to reinvent herself as this trump superfan [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=746.82s)]
*  Um before that though, you know [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=751.38s)]
*  One of her more controversial moments was back in 2017 when she traveled to syria [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=752.6600000000001s)]
*  And met with bashar al-assad who at the time was many many years into massacring his own people [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=756.74s)]
*  She has also questioned us claims that asad used chemical weapons [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=762.8199999999999s)]
*  On the syrian people and criticized the us for supporting the syrian opposition [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=766.5799999999999s)]
*  Then in 2022 after the russian invasion of ukraine tulsi blamed the us and nato for starting the war [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=771.4599999999999s)]
*  Um a lot of her critics like suggest she's kind of a russian stooge or an asset [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=776.9s)]
*  Personally, I think that's that's not a very smart way to talk about her [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=781.8599999999999s)]
*  I think she has clearly just shown poor judgment over and over and over again and seems incapable of [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=785.4599999999999s)]
*  Separating out good information from bad and she tends to think that you know claims from people like vladimir putin are credible [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=791.76s)]
*  Uh or more credible than information from the 18 intelligence agencies that she would be overseeing [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=799.5400000000001s)]
*  So, uh, she also will be the one making sure that good intel gets to trump in the form of the pdb then so [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=806.26s)]
*  I don't know man. Like this is um, this is a wild pick [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=811.3000000000001s)]
*  Surprised the hell out of me. How much does tulsi worry you in this role? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=814.5s)]
*  It worries me a lot I pick up on two things one thing that spamburger said one thing you just said [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=818.1800000000001s)]
*  um and [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=823.0600000000001s)]
*  Tommy it's always a little embarrassing when I [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=824.6600000000001s)]
*  Make a reference such as my age [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=827.3000000000001s)]
*  But i'm so old [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=829.86s)]
*  That I worked on the recommendations of the 911 commission that led to the creation of this position of the dni [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=831.3000000000001s)]
*  which as spamburger said was created because [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=838.34s)]
*  The problem before 9 11 is that the cia and the intelligence function the fbi and these other agencies they didn't share [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=840.9000000000001s)]
*  The bits and pieces of information they had so the point of the dni [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=847.3000000000001s)]
*  They don't run the cia, right? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=850.4200000000001s)]
*  So they're not running like the covert operations at the cia and stuff [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=852.0200000000001s)]
*  But they're there to oversee all these different intelligence agencies in a management role, right to to help make sure that information is being shared [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=855.0600000000001s)]
*  That they're not turf wars [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=863.1400000000001s)]
*  there's zero [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=865.22s)]
*  Chance that tulsa gabbert has any interest in doing that, you know, she's not you know [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=867.46s)]
*  She has no vision for the management of the intelligence community [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=872.1800000000001s)]
*  She probably couldn't name the agencies within the intelligence community [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=874.9s)]
*  Um, and so that that's a problem because then these intelligence agencies again kind of become fiefdoms [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=878.9s)]
*  the second piece of this [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=884.58s)]
*  Is what you reference which is the dni is the person responsible for briefing the president united states on intelligence [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=886.66s)]
*  so [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=893.7s)]
*  Every morning in the pdb. I was in that for a few years [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=894.5s)]
*  The the dni comes in the oval office and tells the president what they need to know [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=897.94s)]
*  And that shapes what's in the president's head going into the day and going into any policymaking [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=902.42s)]
*  In nsc meetings and you were in some of these tommy in the situation room [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=907.62s)]
*  Those meetings usually begin with the director of national intelligence [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=910.8199999999999s)]
*  Briefing the president and the national security team about whatever the situation is, you know, so we're having me on ukraine [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=914.72s)]
*  We'll start with a few minutes in the dni to give us a level set of what's happening [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=920.74s)]
*  And and just consider that [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=924.8199999999999s)]
*  Being filtered through tulsa gabbert's world view, you know [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=927.6999999999999s)]
*  This is somebody [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=931.3s)]
*  I agree with you just kind of calling her, you know, the bringing back the moscow mitch talking points and calling her a russian stooge [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=933.14s)]
*  Um, yeah, sure. I mean i'd be curious whether she ever had any russian connections [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=940.1s)]
*  But she seems to think these things or want to think these things no matter what [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=945.2199999999999s)]
*  And and that's what I worry about. She is the filter of of of worldview to trump [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=949.4599999999999s)]
*  And so just think about what she's gonna be saying in the pdb every day. It is pretty chilling that this is someone [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=954.02s)]
*  That has clearly an affinity for the putin world view the asad world view [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=959.54s)]
*  Now being the person who briefs the president every morning [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=964.42s)]
*  Yeah, and she you know, she accused the u.s of funding isis in syria [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=967.06s)]
*  She accused the u.s of war crimes in syria [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=970.34s)]
*  I mean she really got I don't know if like she went and met with asad and then got attacked for it [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=972.5s)]
*  And then got so dug in that she just assumed more and more entrenched positions, but it's very strange [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=977.14s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of people like look i'm all for meeting with your adversaries, but like basari al-sad is a terrible person [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=982.42s)]
*  There's no question about it. Like he used [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=988.34s)]
*  Okay, even if you doubt that he's chemical weapons on his own people, which you shouldn't you shouldn't doubt that he killed [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=990.74s)]
*  Tens of thousands of them and tortured them and starved people to death [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=996.02s)]
*  I mean this this man has been massacring his own people for years. There's no love lost there [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=999.54s)]
*  Why would you why would you defend him and say that the u.s was a real problem there similarly? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1003.78s)]
*  I mean clearly the russian invasion of ukraine was just an act of naked aggression [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1008.58s)]
*  We can debate whether nato expansion was a good idea [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1012.26s)]
*  But again to blame ukraine to blame the u.s for that happening just suggests a bizarre [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1014.6600000000001s)]
*  Worldview that you're right. I mean, it's not fact-based. It's a worldview, you know, tommy where the left [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1021.12s)]
*  Meets the right right you move so far left or so far right that you're in this kind of conspiracy theory [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1027.7s)]
*  world in between [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1033.78s)]
*  and [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1035.22s)]
*  That may be an interesting person to to get high with in your college dorm room and talk about you know [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1036.1000000000001s)]
*  Noam chomsky or something but [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1041.6200000000001s)]
*  And I you know, I said actually noam chomsky smarter than tulsi gabbert. He's formulated his opinions based on a lot of research [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1044.82s)]
*  Um, but yeah, it's it's this conspiracy theory mindset at the center of power [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1051.6200000000001s)]
*  That should be alarming to people. It's alarming to me at least yeah [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1057.14s)]
*  And you know for what it's worth [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1060.82s)]
*  I mean when she decided to run for president she went pretty hard at trump [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1062.3400000000001s)]
*  She called the solomani strike the assassination of costum solomani an act of war [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1065.46s)]
*  She criticized trump's trade war with china [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1069.3s)]
*  When the trump folks, uh didn't sanction saudi arabia after the murder murder of jamal kashoggi [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1072.34s)]
*  She tweeted at trump quote being saudi arabia's bitch is not america first [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1078.6599999999999s)]
*  So there is a version of tulsi in there when the politics uh strike her, right? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1083.3s)]
*  Yeah, that can be useful but uh, not this one. Um, so ben just to close out this personnel section [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1087.54s)]
*  Uh, I don't think we need to tell anyone why matt gait shouldn't be attorney general. That's pretty self-explanatory [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1092.1799999999998s)]
*  But just a little further down, you know sort of the list of top positions the deputy national security advisor [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1097.8s)]
*  Will either be according to some news reports this [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1103.72s)]
*  Accelerationist right-wing speechwriter guy named michael anton or a right-wing hungarian doofus named seb gorka [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1107.62s)]
*  So that's great. Maybe it'll be a maybe they'll surprise us and pick someone else who knows [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1115.16s)]
*  Um, but I think the most consequential fight we'll talk about today could be over who is the next fbi director? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1119.48s)]
*  Um the establishment types are pushing for [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1125.48s)]
*  Uh a guy named mike rogers [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1128.28s)]
*  He was chairman of the house intelligence committee for many years just lost a center race in michigan [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1130.12s)]
*  But is clearly qualified for the job. I think he came out of the fbi [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1134.6799999999998s)]
*  Um the hardcore maga type so i was listening to steve bannon's show yesterday [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1138.4399999999998s)]
*  Uh, he was talking about this goober they want cash patel. Um patel is someone we've talked about on the show before [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1142.9199999999998s)]
*  He has very little relevant experience. He was a basically a low level [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1149.08s)]
*  Um congressional staffer and nsc staffer and then spent three months as chief of staff to the acting secretary of defense [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1153.6399999999999s)]
*  At the very end of the trump administration when they were all were storming the capital and such [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1161.6399999999999s)]
*  But the mega folks love him because of comments like this [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1165.96s)]
*  We will go out and find the conspirators not just in government but in the media [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1169.72s)]
*  Yes [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1174.1999999999998s)]
*  We're going to come after the people in the media who lied about american citizens who helped joe biden rig presidential elections [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1174.76s)]
*  We're going to come after you whether it's criminal or civilly. We'll figure that out [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1180.92s)]
*  But yeah, we're putting you all on notice and steve. This is why they hate us [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1184.28s)]
*  This is why we're tyrannical [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1187.64s)]
*  This is why we're dictators because we're actually going to use the constitution to prosecute them for crimes [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1188.84s)]
*  They said we have always been guilty of but never have so, you know, look you I think you're talking about bannon there [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1193.96s)]
*  Normally, I give people a little bit of pass for hyperbole [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1200.26s)]
*  But I think we have to take him very seriously and literally here [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1203.24s)]
*  And that's why I think this selection is really going to tell us a lot about which direction this administration is going [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1206.1999999999998s)]
*  Because i like putting cash betel at the fbi [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1212.12s)]
*  When he's grossly unqualified [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1215.4799999999998s)]
*  Is just saying I want someone who is willing to do whatever I say to use the power of the government [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1217.56s)]
*  To punish my enemies and relitigate all these old fights [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1224.1999999999998s)]
*  That's the only reason you would select this guy [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1227.2399999999998s)]
*  And by the way, christopher ray the current fbi director has many many years of his 10-year term left [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1229.8799999999999s)]
*  They would be pulling him out early. Um, and it wasn't entirely clear whether ray was going to be replaced [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1235.0s)]
*  But then jd vance confirmed it today in a quote tweet dunk on some other woman who works for steve bannon [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1240.36s)]
*  Who said they were vetting replacement? So it sounds like this is very much [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1248.36s)]
*  Uh in train this sort of fbi replacement process. Yeah, it's truly scary [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1251.9599999999998s)]
*  Uh, I mean I heard another cash patella club where he said [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1257.08s)]
*  If he was running the fbi, he closed the building [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1261.08s)]
*  Um the fbi building turned it into a museum of the deep state [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1263.64s)]
*  And send those people out into the country to find the real crimes. Um [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1267.88s)]
*  So this is the caliber person we're talking about [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1272.52s)]
*  As usual as with these other appointments we've talked about [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1276.0400000000002s)]
*  Lost in the discussion how crazy it is is actually you'd want the fbi to be doing some pretty important stuff [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1279.72s)]
*  You know if you're actually worried about drug cartels if you're actually worried about crime in this country [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1284.44s)]
*  You you kind of want competent leadership at the fbi [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1289.16s)]
*  But put that aside [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1292.52s)]
*  this is the example of [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1294.1200000000001s)]
*  The worst case scenario of taking the instruments and machinery of the u.s. Government that is most capable [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1297.16s)]
*  of targeting your enemies, um and and putting the worst people in charge of that, right so [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1304.04s)]
*  Mike rogers would be much better be kind of a marco rubio type pick. Um would give me make me feel a little better [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1310.52s)]
*  I mean, I don't agree with mike rogers about a lot of things [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1316.6000000000001s)]
*  But if cash patel is in there [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1319.6399999999999s)]
*  Even if he's the deputy fbi director, like let's say they make mike rogers the fbi guy [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1321.56s)]
*  It's still a very scary signal because the only thing this guy's done [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1326.52s)]
*  In the last eight years is is this is try to go after people when he was at the house intelligence [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1330.28s)]
*  I mean full disclosure. I got hauled in front of the house intelligence committee when he was devin newness's guy [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1335.1599999999999s)]
*  Based on a complete conspiracy theory about I mean to play the old hits tommy [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1341.56s)]
*  Remember unmasking this theory that we'd invented the russia thing [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1346.04s)]
*  And it didn't make any sense because it said we had unmasked trump people talking to russians and we'd invented it [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1350.04s)]
*  So one of those things can't you know, both those things can't be true. Neither were true actually [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1354.84s)]
*  um [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1359.24s)]
*  That we invented it or that we did this unmasking to do it [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1360.28s)]
*  Um, but the point is that this is all this guy cares about he doesn't even have another agenda his agenda is [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1363.24s)]
*  to go after [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1369.48s)]
*  Trump's enemies and we should take that seriously if you also look at the gorka anton thing, too [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1370.68s)]
*  That's an interesting that'd be an interesting pick too because that deputy job kind of runs the machinery of the nsc [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1375.88s)]
*  And it could be that they have got guys like waltz and as the front men in some of these places [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1381.08s)]
*  But then they burrow in these mega-pilled guys [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1385.08s)]
*  These staffer types to go in and really do the dirty work [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1388.6s)]
*  And so that's what i'd also be looking for is whether these types of people end up at these deputy levels where they have a lot [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1392.36s)]
*  Of power, um, even if they're not necessarily the front people even if they're not necessarily confirmed [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1398.2s)]
*  Um for their positions, yeah [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1403.32s)]
*  And look, you know, I was listening to bannon talk about this and we're like we he we need cash at the top job [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1405.48s)]
*  At the fbi not deputy but even if he got [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1410.12s)]
*  The deputy director job, then I just googled the current [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1413.16s)]
*  Deputy fbi director a guy named paul abate. I've never heard of him before he apparently joined the fbi in 1996 [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1416.52s)]
*  And has been a career fbi agent ever since he worked at the counterterrorism division [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1422.6s)]
*  He worked at the new work division's joint terrorism task force [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1427.56s)]
*  He worked back again the counterterrorism division. He was in la like this guy. These are like career [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1431.08s)]
*  civil servants with deep experience in counterterrorism and law enforcement and the [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1437.08s)]
*  Legal structures around the authorities the fbi has these guys are just taking like utterly unqualified hacks people who are just [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1442.76s)]
*  Partisan political operatives like cash patel wrote a children's book called the plot against the king [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1450.92s)]
*  That was an allegory for the russia investigation. That is how [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1456.28s)]
*  Much time he spent kissing trump's ass [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1460.2s)]
*  Uh, and this is the person they're gonna make the fbi director like that is bat shit crazy [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1462.92s)]
*  It yeah, it truly is I mean we're about to be living in some very interesting times and and again we have to put the [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1467.48s)]
*  Pin in it again. This is not trump 1.0. This is I mean trump 1.0 cash patel started, you know working for debba newnes [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1475.56s)]
*  Now we're talking about him being maybe the fbi director. So that that just shows you how far this pendulum [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1483.08s)]
*  Has swung and and [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1489.1599999999999s)]
*  You know people can say yeah, they want [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1491.4799999999998s)]
*  People to shake it up and americans, you know, they're looking for that and i've made that argument myself [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1494.84s)]
*  But they're taking it to an extreme here that is well beyond shaking it up [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1500.6s)]
*  It's about breaking it and remaking it into instruments of trump's will yeah and that that reinforces personal interest [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1504.6s)]
*  I mean just last thing, you know, there is a bit of lingering trump 1.0 [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1510.1999999999998s)]
*  Which is that jared kushner is not going to go back and be the pretend shadow secretary of state in the white house [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1513.32s)]
*  But he reportedly will be an outside advisor helping with any normalization talks between saudi arabia and israel sort of a continuation of the abraham [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1518.9199999999998s)]
*  Accords work he did despite the fact that the saudis cut his investment firm a two billion dollar check [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1527.0s)]
*  After he left the administration, so there's this massive conflict of interest there [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1534.28s)]
*  Uh, and he apparently, you know, he would work with trump's real estate and golf buddy [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1538.3600000000001s)]
*  This guy's steve witkoff who was named the middle east envoy [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1542.44s)]
*  So again like the the sort of friends who are not qualified or family members [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1545.88s)]
*  Some of them outside kind of the guardrails of the government when it comes to financial disclosures, etc [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1551.08s)]
*  Will be coordinating relationships with these, you know [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1556.2s)]
*  multi-billion dollar trillion dollar [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1560.82s)]
*  Saudi gulf autocrats, so uh, you know not great [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1563.48s)]
*  Yeah, I think this is really important. You know chris murphy last week made the point [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1567.24s)]
*  That the main thing to watch in trump's foreign policy is corruption and the monetization of american foreign policy [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1571.96s)]
*  And this is how they do it and I think one thing people have to understand is that this is not unusual around the world [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1577.88s)]
*  You know, let's pick a turkey. Um erdogan's son is [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1583.48s)]
*  I like a billionaire, you know, there's a lot of corruption [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1587.48s)]
*  He goes around the world and he makes deals because if people want to get to erdogan, you know [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1590.92s)]
*  They can invest in this guy and and then maybe erdogan does him a favor, right? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1596.12s)]
*  So there's actually a transactionalism that is familiar to countries [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1602.28s)]
*  I think what we've never seen before is that the united states with all of our power all of our military all of our technology [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1606.28s)]
*  Being in that game at this level. And so the thing i'd watch is that [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1613.48s)]
*  How will countries try to curry favor with trump? It's not the charm offense. It's fucking bullshit [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1618.12s)]
*  We I mean we should devote some time to how they cover trump. It's not that they're going to try to charm him [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1623.6399999999999s)]
*  It's that they're going to try to pay him [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1628.6799999999998s)]
*  It's that they're and they're not going to pay trump directly and it's not even that they're going to stay in his hotels as grotesque [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1631.24s)]
*  As that was it's that they could cut checks to people like jared or other people in the trump orbit who are [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1636.44s)]
*  Anomaly on the outside. Let's not forget elon musk here [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1641.8s)]
*  billions billions [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1645.48s)]
*  Hundreds of billions of dollars potentially if you want the united states to do something bad enough and you can buy it [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1647.0s)]
*  Why wouldn't you you know, and so I think that it's really important [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1652.68s)]
*  It's going to be important to watch this space [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1656.76s)]
*  To see where the money is flowing to the people around trump and jared's case in point [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1659.72s)]
*  But there are others that they will come come into focus here [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1664.28s)]
*  and [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1667.8s)]
*  It the reality is it's what trump always said about you know, everything's corrupt and rigged [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1668.68s)]
*  I mean we're about to find out what that actually looks like [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1673.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's right [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1675.56s)]
*  And there's a lot of ways to get money into his pocket these days whether it's the crypto venture [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1676.28s)]
*  Whether it's the djt stock that's now listed on the nasdaq [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1680.52s)]
*  Whether it's some of these friends and family. There's just a lot of a lot of avenues for corruption [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1684.12s)]
*  Um, all right, then let's switch gears here because there was some big news on the ukraine front [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1688.76s)]
*  So after months of pressure from ukrainians and a lot of people in congress [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1692.84s)]
*  The biden administration finally decided to allow the ukrainian military to use u.s [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1697.08s)]
*  Provided long-range missiles against targets on russian soil. These weapons are called attackms. They can travel up to 190 miles [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1701.24s)]
*  Biden's team told the new york times that the change in policy was a direct response to north korea sending thousands of troops [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1709.16s)]
*  To join the fight in russia. Um, there's also reportedly 50 000 russian and north korean [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1715.88s)]
*  Troops preparing for an assault to take back the kursk region of russia, which ukraine took the summer [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1721.0s)]
*  The russians are very unhappy about this policy change [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1727.0800000000002s)]
*  Kremlin spokesperson demetri peskov said this would cause quote a new spiral of tensions [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1731.3200000000002s)]
*  And then back in september putin said it would be considered a direct attack by nato against russia [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1736.52s)]
*  Earlier this week putin signed a new nuclear doctrine that basically expands the rationale russia can use to uh to use nuclear weapons [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1741.72s)]
*  The new policy basically says that if a non-nuclear country attacks russia [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1748.76s)]
*  But is backed by a nuclear country then russia can consider that a joint attack and therefore could potentially merit a nuclear response [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1753.08s)]
*  So some serious um saber rattling there. Um, the the response to this move was mixed. Um [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1759.72s)]
*  Especially in europe the poland was psyched, uh hungary and slovakia [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1766.1200000000001s)]
*  Criticized biden's decision the germans basically just refused to follow suit and then last week german chancellor olaf schultz [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1770.5s)]
*  Actually called vladimir putin which is the first time in two years that any western leader had spoken directly with the russian president [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1777.56s)]
*  Um schultz said he urged putin to negotiate in that call but zelensky and the ukrainians were very upset about it [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1783.8s)]
*  Germany has an election coming up in february. I imagine that's part of this [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1789.72s)]
*  So some of the maga types were quite unhappy donald trump jr accused biden of trying to cause world war three [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1792.84s)]
*  Mike waltz the incoming national security advisor was a little more measured. Here's a clip of him on fox news monday [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1799.8s)]
*  This is a development, but it's a tactical one [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1806.44s)]
*  President trump is talking grand strategy here [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1809.4s)]
*  Uh, how do we get both sides to the table to the end this war? [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1812.44s)]
*  What's the framework for a deal and who's sitting? [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1816.44s)]
*  Uh at that table, this is an all-star team [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1819.64s)]
*  brian that uh president trump, uh is assembling that will think through these broader strategic issues [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1822.6s)]
*  And how do we drive this war to an end as president trump promised on the campaign trail? [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1829.0s)]
*  A lot of deep fucking thinkers on this team. So ben two things [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1833.4s)]
*  I remember talking with you like a year back about this exact scenario where you've got biden as a lame duck [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1837.24s)]
*  And zelensky desperate to do as much damage to the russians while he can before trump comes in [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1843.56s)]
*  And it just feels unbelievably risky point one and point two [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1849.0s)]
*  If we're being honest and I was the trump administration kind of handed this policy change. I would be furious [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1853.8799999999999s)]
*  And also it just feels like an 11th hour escalation with a kind of confusing rationale like the north korean showing up [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1860.68s)]
*  Is what did this I I just I don't know. I I don't I just don't get it [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1867.72s)]
*  Yeah, first of all, I want to echo you and we're gonna have some fun people shouldn't worry [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1871.8799999999999s)]
*  About our darkness our darkness is we're here to inform [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1876.44s)]
*  Uh, we're here to try to shine light on things, but we'll have plenty of time to make fun of big people like this [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1880.04s)]
*  You know dropping in grand strategy at the same time [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1884.3600000000001s)]
*  He's talking about donald trump assembling like the dream team when it's like cash patel and you know, uh tulsi gabbard doctor osma kates [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1887.8s)]
*  We would be furious any incoming administration would be furious at this significant of a tactical change in a war [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1894.84s)]
*  With like two months left to go not even [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1901.24s)]
*  I I think [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1904.04s)]
*  In terms of the the biden administration [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1905.72s)]
*  This has kind of been the problem with the ukraine policy all along you and I've talked about this this pattern of not doing things [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1907.8799999999999s)]
*  but then ultimately doing them like late and [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1915.56s)]
*  um [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1919.8s)]
*  You know in some cases because it's basically when you look back on this, you know [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1921.0s)]
*  This came to a head a few months ago, right? [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1924.6799999999998s)]
*  Remember the brits were pushing forward kirstein or some others and they said no and [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1926.52s)]
*  And if the only thing that's changed is the north koreans the north koreans have been there for a while [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1932.2800000000002s)]
*  You know, they didn't show up yesterday [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1936.6000000000001s)]
*  And what it feels like to me is that the biden administration? [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1938.76s)]
*  Sees it there are two months left [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1942.3600000000001s)]
*  They're trying to get all that military assistance out the door all the assistance that was in that supplemental the past [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1944.1200000000001s)]
*  Uh earlier this year and they're just trying to let the ukrainians [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1950.76s)]
*  I don't know do some damage to the russians to to put them in a slightly better position [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1955.4s)]
*  When trump comes in and things might be moving to negotiation [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1960.28s)]
*  Is that worth the risk? Is that worth the kind of chaos? I mean just consider if trump comes in and takes us back [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1963.96s)]
*  That then there's like an immediate weird battlefields. He saw they had a capability that they no longer have [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1970.68s)]
*  um, it's just not a [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1976.2s)]
*  it's a pretty destabilizing way to [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1978.44s)]
*  To do this. I I think the pudin thing [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1981.24s)]
*  I don't think he's gonna use nuclear weapons, but I think that's a like he knows trump [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1984.84s)]
*  Will be a bit brushed back by that and I think pudin is very determined [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1988.92s)]
*  To show that he's not gonna, you know cave to trump that he's not eager for a deal [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1993.8799999999999s)]
*  That he he can escalate to that. He has cards to play [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=1999.24s)]
*  And and so I think the ukraine war [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2002.68s)]
*  To your point is is in for a pretty bumpy ride [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2005.3999999999999s)]
*  You know, the ukrainians might ratchet things up the russians might ratchet things up to show that they're not you know, too [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2008.36s)]
*  Hungry for like some trump deal the trump people are coming in [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2014.2s)]
*  They don't know these people they don't have relationships in ukraine in the way that the biden administration does [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2017.8s)]
*  A lot of these people don't have relationships with the europeans [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2023.72s)]
*  The europeans are divided between the hawks as you said in eastern europe and then the kind of more [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2026.28s)]
*  Trumpy people in places like hungary and savakia and then people like schultz are just kind of worried about them getting run over by the [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2031.48s)]
*  politics of this [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2038.44s)]
*  So this could be like a pretty uncertain few months, you know, north koreans are fighting [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2040.1200000000001s)]
*  Um all of a sudden the ukraine war I think is going to start to be [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2046.12s)]
*  You know not so much the status quo ante that we've seen you could see [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2050.12s)]
*  escalations and flare-ups and brinksmanship that that could be pretty pretty alarming [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2054.58s)]
*  Yeah, and you know meanwhile the poor ukrainians. I mean the russians are just pounding them with airstrikes over the weekend [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2060.04s)]
*  They hit I think 120 missiles and 90 drones. They're firing it mostly at energy infrastructure [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2065.32s)]
*  Uh, I think up to nearly 70 percent of ukraine's energy systems have been destroyed [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2070.14s)]
*  And of course we're going into the winter and then to your point on the politics. I mean [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2074.7s)]
*  Yeah, schultz is eyeing this election in february. I think a lot of people think that he is going to lose but [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2078.54s)]
*  the greens and his coalition want uh, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2084.46s)]
*  Germany to be more aggressive in supporting the ukrainians the the cdu candidate the more conservative party candidate [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2087.8199999999997s)]
*  Wants to be more aggression aggressive against the russians in support of ukraine [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2094.3799999999997s)]
*  So it's like the the politics are kind of jumbled and then I saw today ben [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2098.54s)]
*  There was a gallop poll of ukrainians in ukraine obviously [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2102.7s)]
*  52 of ukrainians would like to see their leaders negotiate an end to the war as soon as possible [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2106.2799999999997s)]
*  That number was closer to 22 percent in 2022 [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2111.18s)]
*  Back then like there was an overwhelming majority of the country that wanted to keep fighting [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2116.3s)]
*  And then I saw like of the 52 of ukrainians who want to negotiate an end to the war about half of those are comfortable with [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2120.46s)]
*  Conceding territory, so I feel like you know, there's a lot of fatigue [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2128.2799999999997s)]
*  There's people sitting there writing on the wall [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2132.14s)]
*  And then there's just the the political winds are blowing uh in a tough direction. Yeah, I mean what's really frustrating [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2134.14s)]
*  You know we talked [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2140.8599999999997s)]
*  Over the last couple years about this triumphal this kind of neocon triumphalism about imminent ukrainian victory. What's pretty frustrating is [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2142.8599999999997s)]
*  What should be happening now and we've talked about this. I I did that episode on it for the election series [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2150.06s)]
*  We should be moving into a negotiation [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2155.2599999999998s)]
*  Precisely because the ukrainians are exhausted if if but the question is what kind of deal can they get? [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2158.14s)]
*  Can they get a deal where they basically hold the territory they have and maybe try to negotiate back [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2164.3799999999997s)]
*  Some other bits and pieces in exchange for like things like eu memberships sustained security guarantees [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2169.3399999999997s)]
*  You know the viability and success of ukraine as it remains as a country and manuel mccrone talking about [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2175.8999999999996s)]
*  You know some form of of peacekeeping [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2181.4199999999996s)]
*  presence from european forces there [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2184.2999999999997s)]
*  There's a deal that could end this war [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2187.26s)]
*  but [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2189.7400000000002s)]
*  trump's so forward leaning and his desire to end it that [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2190.54s)]
*  Paradoxically, it incentivizes putin to push and push and push and push and take and take and take and take more [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2195.4s)]
*  Because he has this upper hand and he thinks the u.s. Is withdrawing support and the whole world feels that way [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2200.78s)]
*  and so [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2205.42s)]
*  It's gonna I see why some ukrainians like we're happy that trump won [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2206.94s)]
*  because they just want a different approach this approach of kind of slow bleed and [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2211.34s)]
*  You know incremental weapons falling in and no end on the horizon would would fill me with a lot of despair [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2215.74s)]
*  um, but I really feel [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2222.06s)]
*  Terribly for them because they're in this bind because I wouldn't necessarily want donald trump to be the one negotiating that deal [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2223.66s)]
*  Trump may want something from the ukrainians, right? [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2229.58s)]
*  You know, he may want natural resources and god knows what he'll want from them a dirt on his political opponents [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2231.66s)]
*  Remember that was way back in the first impeachment. So so this the price is seems like it's gonna get higher for the ukrainians [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2236.86s)]
*  Not lower. Yeah, man. I haven't even thought about the prospect of him demanding some kind of you know [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2243.1s)]
*  cut off the top of any deal that is uh, that is bleak and yeah, I mean for the average ukrainian, I mean [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2248.46s)]
*  The you just seeing all your friends go off to war the the draft age is getting lower and lower and lower more people are [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2254.14s)]
*  Getting conscripted things are not looking good and it's um [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2260.2999999999997s)]
*  Uh, it is awful [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2263.42s)]
*  Um speaking of uh awful depressing events been the cop 29 un climate summit is underway in azerbaijan [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2264.7799999999997s)]
*  Fun stuff. So this year's cop got off to a tough start when the united states [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2271.2s)]
*  Once again elected a climate denier. It's not good [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2276.32s)]
*  We're now waiting to see I guess if we get pulled out of the paris climate accords again [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2279.6s)]
*  The main issue at play in this cop is once again when and how much developed countries will contribute to a loss and damage fund [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2283.76s)]
*  For developing countries this fund would provide the means for developing countries to transition away from fossil fuels [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2291.04s)]
*  As well as money to mitigate the effects of climate change the number that's getting kicked around that will be needed is 1.3 trillion dollars a year [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2296.7999999999997s)]
*  Which would come from rich countries but structuring who gets the money how where it comes from is a very difficult task [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2304.56s)]
*  It is now the second week of talks negotiators are still far apart [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2311.36s)]
*  And you know if you think it's a little odd that the climate talks are being held in autocracy where 90% of exports are made [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2315.12s)]
*  Up of fossil fuels you are not alone [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2321.68s)]
*  And it didn't help that the president of azerbaijan kicked off the conference with a speech praising fossil fuels as gifts from god [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2324.2400000000002s)]
*  And he promptly insulted both france and the netherlands [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2330.7200000000003s)]
*  Before the conference there was a video or audio going around of a azerbaijani cop official discussing a fossil fuel deal with someone [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2334.96s)]
*  Pretending to be an investor. So this whole thing has not been on the level [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2343.36s)]
*  We caught up with semaphores climate and energy editor tim mcdonnell who is in baku for the talks [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2346.96s)]
*  Here's what he had to say about the atmosphere one thing that I think is kind of um [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2352.72s)]
*  Sad or sort of missing from this process when you have it in a country that uh, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2358.32s)]
*  doesn't have a very free civil society and press like azerbaijan is that you miss out on a lot of the [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2362.72s)]
*  kind of [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2369.84s)]
*  the protests and the marches and the civil society and the activists and you know people coming from all over the world to kind of [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2370.88s)]
*  Stand up for for what they want to see happen and I think back to glasgow [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2377.7599999999998s)]
*  Top a few years ago where there was a march in the middle of the thing that had you know [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2382.7999999999997s)]
*  Tens of thousands of people at it and I really do think that that has an impact on the way that [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2387.12s)]
*  The the actual you know country delegates and world leaders who are here [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2392.0s)]
*  sort of [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2396.56s)]
*  Sense that that pressure and that's that's totally missing here. Obviously that that kind of protesting and [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2397.44s)]
*  Activism is not possible in this context. So ben, uh, I gotta be honest [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2404.24s)]
*  Very few things make me feel as bleak as imagining uh for more years of climate policy under donald trump [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2409.2s)]
*  It's hard for me to find a silver lining here. You got anything got any pitches? [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2416.16s)]
*  I don't you know elia of the president of azerbaijan [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2419.68s)]
*  Locked up a lot of people in the run-up [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2423.2s)]
*  which is [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2426.0s)]
*  interesting because [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2427.04s)]
*  The theory behind some of these events in the past is oh there'll be a spotlight on this country [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2428.96s)]
*  There will moderate their behavior with respect to things like human rights [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2436.56s)]
*  But you know, they they've been locking up journalists [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2441.68s)]
*  They've been locking up people who are activists on climate never mind just not allowing the kind of mass protests we saw in glasgow [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2444.3999999999996s)]
*  um, and it kind of just shows you how the [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2451.7599999999998s)]
*  Geopolitical winds have shifted that a country can feel that comfortable doing that knowing that everybody's coming to town [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2454.46s)]
*  And look tommy, I guess my only you know dark humor because maybe that's how we have to find [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2460.8799999999997s)]
*  um a way through this is that [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2465.9199999999996s)]
*  If you were to write like a thousand page novel about like what's happening in [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2467.9199999999996s)]
*  You know the 2020s [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2473.6s)]
*  You could do worse than opening it at the climate change summit. That's being held in like an autocratic [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2475.52s)]
*  State that has 90 of its exports on fossil fuels [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2482.8799999999997s)]
*  At the same time that donald trump is being elected president united states [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2486.8799999999997s)]
*  It's it's like that's what's happening in the world right now. You know that [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2490.3999999999996s)]
*  That kind of transactionalism [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2493.84s)]
*  That kind of autocracy that kind of corruption [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2496.0800000000004s)]
*  That kind of disregard [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2499.92s)]
*  Um kind of you know in the same way that maga likes to own the libs in this country [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2501.6000000000004s)]
*  You know aliyev wants to own the climate change activists globally [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2506.48s)]
*  um [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2510.48s)]
*  That's where we are and so we have to kind of rethink everything about how we advocate on climate just showing up at the [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2511.28s)]
*  You know at the cop that's in azurebyjohn and asking for more money for the loss and damage fund that's important, but that's [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2518.7999999999997s)]
*  That's not going to get us there. Uh [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2526.56s)]
*  So we have to kind of go back to the drawing board about this cop process [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2528.56s)]
*  Um, I think the paris agreement will continue even without the united states [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2532.08s)]
*  But but maybe like let's have it in a you know, the next one's in brazil, which is good [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2534.56s)]
*  That's the kind of place it should be you know in a country that is pretty serious about climate action not perfect, but uh, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2538.64s)]
*  but yeah, this one is [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2546.08s)]
*  I mean you could [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2548.16s)]
*  You know, I don't I don't know what i've mentioned novel. I could also see like a 10-part hulu documentary. I mean this sounds like [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2549.6s)]
*  In a strange way [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2557.92s)]
*  This is [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2560.3199999999997s)]
*  The perfect encapsulation of what is happening in this world right now, you know [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2561.3599999999997s)]
*  It's uh pretty dark. The only one that would be worse would be doing it in argentina [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2566.24s)]
*  Where javier mille is now saying he wants to lead the paris climate agreement, too [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2570.64s)]
*  Uh, he's also someone who called climate change quote a socialist lie, so no surprise there, but you mentioned brazil then [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2574.96s)]
*  Biden's in brazil right now. He's a little international summitry [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2581.36s)]
*  He became the first president to visit the amazon rainforest, which is good and important [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2584.64s)]
*  He's had there to highlight the need to preserve the amazon to prevent logging [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2589.04s)]
*  Uh because the amazon takes all this carbon out of the atmosphere. Uh, biden talked about his record on climate change [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2593.92s)]
*  He argued that the clean energy revolution in america is irreversible [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2600.2400000000002s)]
*  Which is you know, I think an attempted a hopeful message [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2605.28s)]
*  But biden also pledged some u.s funding to protect the amazon which unfortunately will almost certainly be reversed by the trump administration [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2607.92s)]
*  So we're going to take a few steps back before we can go forward again [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2614.8s)]
*  But these these two summits you get the g20 and apex most of the focus was on trump [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2617.52s)]
*  Um, and just to hammer that home somehow biden and canadian prime minister justin trudeau missed the g20 [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2623.52s)]
*  Group photo of the leaders. They were just late for some logistical reason [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2630.2400000000002s)]
*  So, um on the margins, you know biden and the chinese president qi jian ping they cut a deal [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2634.4s)]
*  Agreeing that artificial intelligence will never be in control of nuclear weapons [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2639.76s)]
*  I'm glad they got that done, but it's a little scary to think that that was like on the table [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2644.6400000000003s)]
*  If we had to talk about that, but I don't know like there there was some [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2650.8s)]
*  brazil specific stuff [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2653.92s)]
*  I want to talk about anything else from these summits from you [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2654.88s)]
*  I mean, I just I like I feel for biden like every lame duck at a summit [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2656.88s)]
*  You always feel like a lame duck, but it feels like it's really um [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2660.88s)]
*  It's really exacerbated this time. I thought a lot. I went to an apex summit with obama after trump's last victory [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2664.56s)]
*  Uh, and it was pretty dark, but people didn't quite know [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2670.7200000000003s)]
*  What the hell was going on? [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2674.48s)]
*  Um, you know, what's trump going to be like he was you know his team that he was rolling out [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2676.48s)]
*  Yes, it had to be abandoned, but there were some conventional people in the mix [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2681.44s)]
*  Um, I i'll always be haunted telling me by this comment that shijin ping made to obama was in the meeting [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2684.8799999999997s)]
*  At that summit in peru, same lima the same place that biden had an apex summit [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2690.64s)]
*  and shijin ping said [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2694.9599999999996s)]
*  about trump, uh [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2697.2799999999997s)]
*  If an immature leader throws the world into chaos the world will know who to blame [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2698.8799999999997s)]
*  And and I think we've kind of been dealing with that ever since you know [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2703.52s)]
*  You see that china's doing business on that. This is what jumped out to me from this [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2706.4799999999996s)]
*  So shijin ping opened a like billion dollar plus port [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2710.56s)]
*  in peru [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2715.6s)]
*  Um, that's a big part of their investment to win over the global south through these, you know [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2716.88s)]
*  They build infrastructure and then they extract critical minerals for a clean energy transition [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2720.72s)]
*  Poor tony blink and announced like a few million dollars in like diesel train engines or something just kind of not and that's not a shot [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2725.28s)]
*  At them. It's just that the chinese are running away with this thing in terms of [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2731.68s)]
*  They have a predictable [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2736.4s)]
*  uh [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2738.48s)]
*  Policy that they can continue administration to administration [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2739.84s)]
*  And we're all watching the trump show here. The rest of the world is moved on [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2743.2000000000003s)]
*  They're aligning around china. They're aligning or they're neutral like lula guys like lula [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2748.6400000000003s)]
*  They're gonna be very important the brazilian president in the next couple years. Where do they go? You know, how do they? [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2753.36s)]
*  Do they just kind of go all in with the bricks? [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2759.2000000000003s)]
*  uh [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2761.2000000000003s)]
*  Which brazil is obviously part of or do they kind of hedge their bets and move back and forth? [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2762.08s)]
*  Do they keep working on climate change, but you could kind of the vibes out of the summits were very [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2765.92s)]
*  It wasn't just because these countries priced in trump [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2771.6800000000003s)]
*  The vibes are very much like the u.s is kind of them not being in the picture was unfortunately a pretty apt metaphor [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2774.32s)]
*  Yeah for kind of where the world is going [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2779.76s)]
*  and [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2783.52s)]
*  and look there's [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2785.1200000000003s)]
*  I to find the opportunity and I think we you and I talked about having conversations, you know having it in next year [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2786.7200000000003s)]
*  but the opportunity is we got to [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2792.32s)]
*  To borrow a poorly [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2795.28s)]
*  Well, I was gonna say build back better [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2797.6800000000003s)]
*  It's a rebuild, you know [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2800.56s)]
*  We need a new foreign policy for as democrats entirely new to deal with this world that i'm just describing a world in which [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2802.32s)]
*  There is no liberal rules-based order with the u.s at the center of it. There's opportunity in that frankly [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2808.96s)]
*  You know there's opportunity in a rebuild and and that's kind of how we have to start thinking [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2814.32s)]
*  What is a different foreign policy look like that is actually designed for this world that we're in? [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2818.7200000000003s)]
*  The problem with the biden foreign policy is so much of it was designed for the world that doesn't exist anymore [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2824.24s)]
*  Yeah, the america is back is just not going to work after four years. We're not going to be back in the same way [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2828.64s)]
*  We're going to be a different spot. Yeah, one just brazil specific thing we want to talk about so [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2833.68s)]
*  Uh, there's an issue that's causing enormous problems in brazil itself, which is sports gambling brazil [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2838.64s)]
*  Is now the third largest market in the world for sports betting after the u.s in the uk [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2845.04s)]
*  It was responsible for 21 billion dollars in transactions last year [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2850.32s)]
*  Which is a 71 increase from four years ago [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2854.4s)]
*  And it is so pervasive that consumer spending in the country and aggregate is down [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2857.52s)]
*  And the gdp of brazil could take a 0.3 hit this year because of gambling [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2862.48s)]
*  Um and making things worse is the fact that many people are using credit cards or mobile loan apps [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2867.44s)]
*  To gamble and they're ended up paying massive interest rates on their debt up to [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2873.36s)]
*  430 some odd percent [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2877.82s)]
*  But then maybe the most shocking part about this whole story is that sports gambling only became legal in brazil in 2018 [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2880.4s)]
*  Before that most forms of gambling were banned with a few notable exceptions, uh, like lotteries or horse racing [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2887.6800000000003s)]
*  But you know data released by the brazilian government suggests that in august of this year [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2894.88s)]
*  More than 20 percent of the funds from brazil's welfare program were spent on sports betting [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2900.8s)]
*  So like this is impacting the poorest people in the country in a very meaningful way in the country itself as well [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2907.28s)]
*  And the question of sort of how it got so bad so quickly there seems to be a few parts [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2913.2s)]
*  Um, I think some of it was people were isolated and bored during the pandemic and they turned to this, you know new hobby [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2917.6s)]
*  There was an explosion of marketing including almost all of the soccer teams in brazil being [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2924.48s)]
*  Sponsored by sports betting companies and there just clearly weren't [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2930.8s)]
*  Anywhere near enough regulations in place to prevent abuse or prevent kids from getting on the side or prevent people from doing hardball things [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2935.28s)]
*  So the good news is that the government has already taken steps to regulate and rein in the sports betting industry [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2941.84s)]
*  Um, but it was sort of an eye-opening [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2949.44s)]
*  Uh story ben because you know, I think people in in [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2951.76s)]
*  The uk in particular are very used to gambling being sort of a pervasive part of culture about them [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2956.0800000000004s)]
*  endorsing teams it's a [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2962.4s)]
*  It's something in the u.s [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2964.7200000000003s)]
*  That was you know, everyone people had a bookie or you had to go to vegas to gamble and now it's lots and lots of states [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2965.84s)]
*  Are allowing online sports gambling to happen [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2971.44s)]
*  But you know, it's a story about how there does need to be some regulation in place some friction in place to protect people or else [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2973.52s)]
*  Man, I mean a point three percent hit the gdp. I mean that is that is a shockingly large impact from you know [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2979.6800000000003s)]
*  Betting on a soccer game. Yeah, you're right to highlight this you mentioned the story to me and and [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2986.2400000000002s)]
*  I was reading up on it and it's it's truly wild and and [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2991.12s)]
*  I guess the constructive thing i'd say [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2996.16s)]
*  To connect some of these threads that we've been talking about there is a ripeness for a certain kind of populism [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=2998.72s)]
*  That doesn't exist right now [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3004.8799999999997s)]
*  and [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3006.96s)]
*  You know, there's so much talk about the populism on the right [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3008.24s)]
*  Um, which is kind of a populism against the establishment and against the way things have been done and against identity politics in this country [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3010.96s)]
*  or whatever it is [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3018.56s)]
*  There's a space for a populism that is basically about the people that are actually screwing [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3020.64s)]
*  most people, you know the [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3028.4s)]
*  the people running sports gambling in [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3031.2799999999997s)]
*  Brazil the kind of crypto bros trying to you know, take over the american economy [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3034.64s)]
*  The corporate malfeasance that's out there in the world the kind of fossil fuel interests trying to undermine climate change [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3040.24s)]
*  It's you know, just think about what we have talked about in the last few segments [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3047.6s)]
*  Think about the populist message that could be created about taking back [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3052.24s)]
*  Power from those people and I know you're talking to bernie later. It's a little different than bernie's kind of [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3057.04s)]
*  redistributionist populist message [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3064.14s)]
*  This is about kind of how does power work and it's kind of an inverse of what trump's message is because trump's message is [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3067.2s)]
*  Power has been in the hand of these establishments. Let's break them and take it [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3073.44s)]
*  But but he wants to take it and give it to the kind of people [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3076.96s)]
*  I guess he would probably love to invest in sports gambling, you know [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3079.44s)]
*  There'll probably be a trump gambling website in this country. Oh, yeah [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3082.4s)]
*  Yeah [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3086.88s)]
*  Sorry if I just gave them an idea, you know don jr, you know [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3087.92s)]
*  So this is something that we should think about is what is that populist message that speaks to the kind of sense of pervasive corruption? [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3091.92s)]
*  And all these different aspects [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3098.48s)]
*  Well, don jr apparently is going to go to work at a venture capital firm [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3100.08s)]
*  That is investing in like anti-woke everything. It's like, uh, [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3104.48s)]
*  It's though they're calling it the republican parallel economy, which I guess means I I mean i've been like joking about this with friends [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3109.92s)]
*  Like i'd love to see like anti-woke plates [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3116.4s)]
*  Anti-woke cup, you know anti-woke, uh, uh, catheter bags, you know, like what are we talking about here? This is like such a [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3119.36s)]
*  Made up nonsensical job, but this is apparently what he's gonna go do for a living. Here's the thing. I'd watch on this [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3127.36s)]
*  Is they want these corporations to kind of do what they want, you know, maybe give them money and things like that [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3132.88s)]
*  There is a big tax bill coming up [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3138.2400000000002s)]
*  What if the price for your corporate tax rate is you know, how anti-woke are you? [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3140.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, there's gonna be a lot of pressure, right? Yeah [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3144.0800000000004s)]
*  Well, there's also apparently talk about you know [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3146.32s)]
*  All the cuts are going to need to put in place to pay for the extension of the trump tax cuts [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3148.1600000000003s)]
*  Which might include things like, you know food stamps or medicare medicaid. I mean, it's it's going to be a big price tag [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3151.92s)]
*  You're right. Yeah. Well, this is in the category of watch what trump does not just what he says. Yeah, that's right [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3157.2000000000003s)]
*  Finally ben, uh, you know, you and I've worked in campaigns. We worked in the white house doing advance work for [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3162.6400000000003s)]
*  Politicians can be very tough because you have to think through every minute detail if something gets screwed up [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3169.5800000000004s)]
*  It's on you [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3174.2400000000002s)]
*  You got to be on the site hours and hours in advance [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3175.04s)]
*  Of them showing up usually before dawn and then you have to relay [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3178.0s)]
*  Any weird special requests and kind of be an officious little pain in the ass at times [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3181.6800000000003s)]
*  And that is why we here at pod save the world want to raise a glass to salute all the staffers who worked for [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3187.92s)]
*  Paulina brandberg sweden's minister of gender equality [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3193.66s)]
*  According to emails leaked to a swedish tabloid brandberg is either extremely allergic to or just afraid of bananas [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3197.7599999999998s)]
*  Her staff has sent a series of emails to hosts of events requesting that no bananas be in the area where she was staying [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3205.2s)]
*  Another said that no bananas are allowed on the premises while she is at the meeting itself [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3212.64s)]
*  And another declared that there should be no traces of bananas in the rooms where she was in so [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3217.92s)]
*  To her credit when asked about it brandberg said it's sort of an allergy [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3224.1600000000003s)]

*  So you published an op-ed on monday that began quote the united states government must stop blatantly violating the law with regard to arms sales [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3509.3s)]
*  israel [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3517.2999999999997s)]
*  Can you explain why you believe that the current policy is violating the law and how these joint resolutions of disapproval? [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3518.42s)]
*  That you have introduced in congress could help stop that to be honest with you. This is not just my opinion [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3526.18s)]
*  The facts are very very clear [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3532.18s)]
*  the foreign assistance act and the arms export control act [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3534.66s)]
*  What they tell us in very explicit language is united states military aid [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3539.46s)]
*  Cannot go to a country which is in violation of international [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3545.38s)]
*  law [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3550.02s)]
*  Our humanitarian and which is blocking [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3551.46s)]
*  humanitarian aid israel according to the united nations [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3554.6400000000003s)]
*  According to every humanitarian organization on the ground according to numerous countries around the world is in fact doing [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3559.46s)]
*  Just that they are violating international law with regard to the way they are [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3567.6200000000003s)]
*  Conducting their efforts in gaza and they are certainly blocking humanitarian aid so no question to my mind [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3573.06s)]
*  but that [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3581.38s)]
*  It would be against the law for the united states to continue providing offensive weapons to israel about a month ago [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3582.74s)]
*  Tony blake and the secretary of state and loyd austin the secretary of defense [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3589.2999999999997s)]
*  They sent a letter to the israeli government raising concerns that the idf was laying siege northern gaza [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3592.8199999999997s)]
*  And it listed a bunch of demands including that the idf allow at least [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3598.98s)]
*  350 a trucks into gaza per day or else you know some unspecified consequences [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3603.2000000000003s)]
*  The suggestion was that the u.s might cut off military aid to israel [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3608.5s)]
*  In response to that letter the israeli government basically did nothing [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3613.38s)]
*  And yet the biden administration announced that there would be no changes or consequences [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3618.1s)]
*  What do you what do you think happened why why do you think the response is so consistently feckless look tommy this is [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3623.8s)]
*  actually a very painful issue for me because [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3630.28s)]
*  Uh, I consider joe biden a personal friend. I have worked with him on many domestic issues [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3633.88s)]
*  I can believe that on [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3640.1200000000003s)]
*  Issues facing workers in america. He's probably been the most progressive [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3642.84s)]
*  president since fdr for a variety of reasons [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3646.84s)]
*  But on this issue of israel they are dead wrong and what pains me is [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3650.12s)]
*  They are embarrassing themselves. You just gave one example [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3655.8s)]
*  But I think many of your viewers have heard biden saying time and time and time again [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3659.64s)]
*  I'm talking to netanyahu. I'm angry at netanyahu. We're gonna do this. We're gonna do that [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3664.84s)]
*  Oh, but here's some more money you continue and he could netanyahu continues to do [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3669.08s)]
*  Exactly what he wants to do. So this is really [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3673.88s)]
*  Yeah, almost an embarrassment in my mind [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3677.4s)]
*  for the biden administration and essentially [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3681.56s)]
*  We've got to stop it. We have finally got to say to the biden administration. You know what the law is the law [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3685.0s)]
*  Uh, what is going on right now in gaza is unspeakable [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3691.4s)]
*  We're talking about a horrific humanitarian [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3695.88s)]
*  Disaster, we're talking as we speak tommy at this moment [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3699.62s)]
*  The likelihood that many thousands of children are not only suffering malnutrition they are actually starving to death [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3703.64s)]
*  and every request [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3711.48s)]
*  That the biden administration has made to netanyahu has been totally rebuffed laughed at ignored [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3713.32s)]
*  And I think finally the united states senate has got to say enough is enough [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3719.32s)]
*  You ain't going to get any more money. You're not going to get any more arms [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3723.88s)]
*  While you continue to violate [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3728.04s)]
*  American law and americans america's sense of morality [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3730.04s)]
*  Yeah, so we're talking on tuesday. I believe these votes on the resolutions are wednesday, correct? [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3734.04s)]
*  Is it a series of votes on different weapons systems? Like how does this work? Yes, that's right. There'll be [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3739.72s)]
*  Uh three we're talking about three weapon systems [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3745.16s)]
*  We're talking about 120 millimeter tank rounds [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3748.84s)]
*  120 millimeter meter high explosive mortar rounds [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3752.2599999999998s)]
*  Uh and blocking, uh the sale of jdams which are guidance kits [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3755.64s)]
*  Attached to many of the bombs dropped in gaza. So three separate resolutions three votes, right? [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3760.2s)]
*  Um, yeah, I think sort of the the the elephant in the room here is that president trump is going to be back in the white [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3765.3199999999997s)]
*  House soon. He has signaled, you know, basically full support for netanyahu in gaza and in lebanon on top of that [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3770.44s)]
*  He just named mike huckabee to be his u.s [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3776.6s)]
*  Ambassador to israel and huckabee is out there saying that there is no such thing as a west bank or a settler or a settlement [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3778.92s)]
*  Or an occupation right? He's someone who sounds like he wants full annexation [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3784.44s)]
*  How concerned are you about the israeli government fully annexing the west bank in the next four years? [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3789.0s)]
*  And is there anything congress can do about it? Well, of course congress can do something about it and I think [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3794.04s)]
*  that a [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3801.0s)]
*  Majority of the american people and a strong majority of democrats, especially and young people [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3803.16s)]
*  Are sick and tired of funding [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3809.2400000000002s)]
*  a right-wing extremist government [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3811.7200000000003s)]
*  Which is wavy waging all-out war against the palestinian people [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3814.6s)]
*  including killing [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3819.48s)]
*  some [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3821.7200000000003s)]
*  43,000 and injuring over a hundred thousand. So the answer is is there something that can be done? Of course, there's something to be done [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3823.14s)]
*  That's what we're starting to do tomorrow [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3828.76s)]
*  Is to say to the netanyahu government, you know what? [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3830.76s)]
*  You're not getting another nickel of u.s taxpayer money unless there are fundamental very very deep reforms [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3833.88s)]
*  Not only in terms of your conduct your atrocious conduct in gaza, but on [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3840.52s)]
*  In the west bank as well. So we have the power of the person. Look israel is an independent country. They can do what they want [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3845.48s)]
*  They can become a international pariah, but they should not be able to do it with american taxpayer dollars [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3852.6s)]
*  You know in this election president trump, I think pretty successfully [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3858.92s)]
*  Argued or at least convinced voters that he was the anti-war candidate while the democratic side [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3862.44s)]
*  Kamala harris and joe biden were pro-war were pro, you know military intervention overseas [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3868.04s)]
*  How do you think democrats can get back the mantle of the anti-war party? Well for us thought voting for these [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3873.32s)]
*  resolutions, uh, and [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3880.26s)]
*  Look and by the way on top of all that you have a good friend elon musk [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRMZGNSqNRA&t=3883.1600000000003s)]
