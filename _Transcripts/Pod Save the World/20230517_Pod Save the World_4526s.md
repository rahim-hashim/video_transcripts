# Thailand Rejects Military Parties Bid in Historic Elections | Pod Save The World
**Pod Save the World:** [May 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA)
*  Welcome back to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Max Fisher. Ben is off this week. So Max is jumping in as co-host [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=0.0s)]
*  It's great to see you before joining cricket media Max covered foreign affairs [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=7.28s)]
*  For some obscure niche outlets like the New York Times, the Washington Post, Vox, the Atlantic, and we're missing [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=11.72s)]
*  Snore. Some of the biggest names in all of media. He also wrote a great book called The Chaos Machine which details all social media [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=17.56s)]
*  Rewired our brains and frankly societies all around the world. This is an amazing introduction [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=23.96s)]
*  I feel like I should be giving you some props here. You're a lot better credentialed than I am. I'm I saw underwear [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=29.14s)]
*  But what underwear it is, you know, it has evolved over time [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=35.94s)]
*  It was really funny to think back the most scandalous thing in politics was Bill Clinton being asked boxers are briefs at one point [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=42.54s)]
*  I had forgotten about that and then he was like I'll show you scandals. The 90s are just I know we're gonna talk [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=47.66s)]
*  It was like the incredible prudishness of the 90s, but it's always coming back to you [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  Like we're gonna talk about like the Tommy Tuberville stuff. It's like 90s throwback. That guy [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=57.9s)]
*  Bad guy pretty good coach. Let's be honest. Okay, so we got a lot of news today [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=62.22s)]
*  Updates on the war in Ukraine the latest in the seemingly endless series of stories [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=66.22s)]
*  Based on these classified Pentagon documents that were leaked to the social media site [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=71.1s)]
*  Discord by the way, how pissed do you think all the other outlets are that the Washington Post? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=75.53999999999999s)]
*  Seems to have gotten all these documents and nobody else has so I have friends who on both of the post and the New York Times [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=79.53999999999999s)]
*  Teams and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=85.89999999999999s)]
*  They every time one of them has a story the people on the other paper are like we had that or they have some excuse [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=87.2s)]
*  For like oh actually we have this other story that was better like they cheated to get that one [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=93.78s)]
*  I was gonna say I guess that's better than your editor coming to you every day being like can we match that? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=98.14s)]
*  Can we match that? Oh, there's a lot of that too. Yeah, but I think they're having a great time [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=101.46s)]
*  I think they both love it. It's a it's a good-natured rivalry. Okay, it's nice to hear [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=104.74s)]
*  So there's also election results in Turkey and Thailand why the US is in a war of words with South Africa [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=108.3s)]
*  The aforementioned senator Tommy Tuberville is the Tuberville or Tuberville who cares? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=114.54s)]
*  He's an asshole some shorter updates on Sudan Gaza China title 42 and then max you are our in-house optimist [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=119.46000000000001s)]
*  And you promised to make us feel hopeful. So I'm excited for that [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=126.58s)]
*  I have five five good news things to make you feel the warm and fuzzies and also frankly that the Turkey and Thailand stuff [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=130.26s)]
*  I'm really excited to get into because it's some like some pretty encouraging stuff happening. Yeah, it's big news [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=136.46s)]
*  And we're gonna go guest list today so that max and I can really spread our wings and flourish here [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=140.92s)]
*  I'm to be free. Yeah [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=146.0s)]
*  It's like we play so max scary night last night for people in Ukraine because [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=147.2s)]
*  Russia launched a huge barrage of missiles at Ukrainian cities [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=150.72s)]
*  The good news is that Ukraine's missile defense systems presumably the new American-made Patriot missile batteries [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=154.16s)]
*  We're able to intercept all of them including the most advanced hypersonic version of the Russian missiles [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=160.68s)]
*  President Zelensky meanwhile has been on the road [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=167.12s)]
*  He went to Italy France Germany and the UK during those visits [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=169.67999999999998s)]
*  He was promised billions in military aid including a three billion dollar commitment from the Germans [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=173.84s)]
*  And air defense systems drones and long-range missiles from the UK [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=178.39999999999998s)]
*  Rishi Sunak the British Prime Minister promised to start training Ukrainian pilots on the f-16 fighter jets [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=182.2s)]
*  Now Ukraine just needs to get some of those jets from someone but the US is not offering yet [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=188.23999999999998s)]
*  You don't think being on the flight simulator is enough. You're fighting fighting the Russians on PlayStation [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=193.83999999999997s)]
*  Genesis or whatever so last December over in the US [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=199.79999999999998s)]
*  Congress passed a 48 billion dollar aid package for Ukraine all but six billion of that money has been spent [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=203.16s)]
*  And many people are worried about getting more out of the Republican House of Representatives [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  So passing the hat in Europe will be key for Ukraine's ability to keep fighting [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=212.72s)]
*  Zelensky also met with Pope Francis while in Italy [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=216.64s)]
*  The Pope has been pushing for peace talks interesting to see how that develops. So max two questions [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=219.28s)]
*  First how much do you think it killed Boris Johnson the disgraced former Prime Minister? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=224.44s)]
*  To see Rishi Sunak getting the cool photo op with Zelensky at checkers the Prime Minister's country house [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=229.95999999999998s)]
*  I think it did kill him a Boris was still one of the first in in Keefe [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=237.1s)]
*  Which is I don't like to hand it to the guy but you kind of have to hand it the guy that was pretty good [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=241.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah true [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=246.0s)]
*  Do do we think [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=248.04s)]
*  Zelensky is essentially like waiting to get these commitments before they begin this long-promised spring offensive [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=249.88s)]
*  So that Ukraine knows like literally how much ammunition they can expend, right? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=257.38s)]
*  It's about figuring out what Ukraine can do with their spring offensive [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=261.72s)]
*  Which is their answer to the big Russian offensive over the winter, but it's also it's much bigger than that [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=266.16s)]
*  it's about figuring out what is the rest of the war gonna look like because there is I gather a [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=271.68s)]
*  Sense in Keefe that [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=276.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, they were still getting an enormous amount of Western support and things like the training on the f-16s [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=277.96s)]
*  That they probably hit the high water mark [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=283.24s)]
*  Yeah, this winter was probably about the pinnacle of Western support and now it's gonna be this struggle for [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=285.56s)]
*  getting each incremental piece and keeping it going because this war is really more than it's even a war of [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=290.96s)]
*  Front lines or troop limits a war of attrition. Yeah, and that is in terms of you know artillery shells and [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=297.32s)]
*  Tubes but it's also about money and it's both sides [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=304.12s)]
*  I think are hitting a point where they're not running out but it's running lower and that's gonna affect how they can fight this war [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=307.24s)]
*  Yeah [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=313.4s)]
*  It really is like a grinding World War two or World War one style like war of attrition at times of just sort of how much [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=313.64s)]
*  artillery can you launch per week and political attrition and economic attrition and industrial attrition and it's like [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=319.76s)]
*  like so much of the war is gonna come down to I think just like [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=326.2s)]
*  Factories and munitions and industrial policy and sanctions on Russia [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=330.23999999999995s)]
*  But of course behind all of this and I'm sure coming up in all of his meetings in Europe are [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=335.35999999999996s)]
*  Murmurs over whether it's time to start pushing for a peace deal [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=339.71999999999997s)]
*  Which is also interlinked with this question of how much support and for how long yeah, that's true [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=343.59999999999997s)]
*  And then listeners can see this but we're both wearing kind of a Zelensky green shirts today [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=347.71999999999997s)]
*  So in solidarity Joe Biden goes the g7 on Wednesday when this show comes out [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=351.96s)]
*  Sure, this will be a huge topic of conversation you can that is President Trump was asked about the war in Ukraine during his CNN [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=357.12s)]
*  Town hall. Here's a clip Ukraine to win this war. I [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=364.08s)]
*  Don't think in terms of winning and losing I think in terms of getting it settled [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=368.64s)]
*  So we stopped killing all these people and breaking down [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=372.52s)]
*  I [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=375.04s)]
*  Can you say if you want Ukraine or Russia to win this war I want everybody to stop dying [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=388.40000000000003s)]
*  They're dying Russians and Ukrainians. I wanted to stop time [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=395.24s)]
*  And I'll have that done I'll have that done in 24 hours [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=400.36s)]
*  So it is objectively weird that he won't say that he wants the country that was invaded [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=403.92s)]
*  Right to win the war right when the other when the Russians are committing war crimes. I do wonder [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=409.6s)]
*  If that answer would be popular among a broad swath of the electorate. Unfortunately, it sounds reasonable. I'm not I'm not a like [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=414.52000000000004s)]
*  Putin is controlling Trump like conspiracy guy. I'm not like a p-tape conspiracy guy, but [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=422.2s)]
*  His [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=428.36s)]
*  Repeated just rushing to embrace whatever Putin's position is whatever is driving [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=429.44s)]
*  That is really striking clearly part of this and also we know he has a grudge against Zelensky because Zelensky would not dig up the [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=434.36s)]
*  You know quote-unquote dirt that Trump wanted [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=440.71999999999997s)]
*  To you know, try to defeat by yeah [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=444.4s)]
*  So I mean, I don't know we went through this in 2015 2016 where Trump would say things that sounded kind of dovish [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=446.8s)]
*  And sounded about like we're gonna make peace and then he would get in and he wouldn't do anything [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=454.8s)]
*  He wasn't interested and his only involvement would be to turn the screws on allies to try to extract resources and commitments from them [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=459.8s)]
*  Yeah, and meanwhile, there's all this speaking of turning the screws [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=467.03999999999996s)]
*  There's a lot of pressure on Joe Biden to skip the g7 to stay home and deal with the debt ceiling [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=469.92s)]
*  I don't think there's any chance he's gonna do that [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=474.92s)]
*  But you know [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=476.78s)]
*  it's nice of Kevin McCarthy to manufacture a controversy in advance of a global summit to try to [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=477.68s)]
*  Embarrass the president loves the congressional Republicans is helping out with you know [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=483.36s)]
*  How much they care about American greatness and American standing in the world? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=486.88s)]
*  So they're always always willing to pitch in for America first max. So in public president Zelensky has shown a lot of restraint [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=489.48s)]
*  I think we're talking about the war he talks about repelling invaders liberating Ukrainian villages [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=496.0s)]
*  He has promised repeatedly not to use US weapons to strike inside Russia because of escalation concerns [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=501.68s)]
*  But a document in the discord leak of classified Pentagon documents paints a very different picture behind closed doors [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=507.59999999999997s)]
*  It says Zelensky is proposed occupying cities on the Russian side of the border to gain leverage in future negotiations [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=514.54s)]
*  Bombing a Russian oil pipeline to Hungary in hitting targets inside Russia [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=521.24s)]
*  Previously the Post had reported on Ukraine considering attacking Russian-linked forces in Syria [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=526.1999999999999s)]
*  We've also seen all these mysterious drone attacks and things within Russia and Crimea [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=531.0s)]
*  This intelligence certainly seems to help explain why the US has been so resistant to provide longer-range missiles and fighter jets [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=536.0s)]
*  So you're reading this piece? I can't say I'm surprised by [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=543.5600000000001s)]
*  Zelensky's frustration or desire to kind of go on offense. I was a little surprised to read about it in the newspaper [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=547.44s)]
*  it is one of the first times I've [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=553.6s)]
*  Wondered about the ethics of publication of this document. I'm not criticizing the reporters who did so I just maybe think about it [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=555.6400000000001s)]
*  Zelensky, you know, he may have been considering occupying a Russian village [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=563.7800000000001s)]
*  But he didn't do it right and now the Russians could maybe use this to paint him as some sort of aggressor [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=566.98s)]
*  You have covered foreign affairs for years [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=571.74s)]
*  You've been in conversations in newsrooms about when or when not to publish a story what to withhold [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=573.98s)]
*  Yeah [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=579.7s)]
*  What do you make of the post decision to go to head with this one? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=579.94s)]
*  And what are those conversations like so I initially like you I saw this and I was like, huh [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=583.1800000000001s)]
*  That's kind of a lot to put in the newspaper because this will have or could have some kind of real ramifications [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=588.78s)]
*  Because these are really drastic steps that he's talking about [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=594.66s)]
*  So, you know, I talked to some people at these papers about what they were thinking and you know [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=597.66s)]
*  kind of thought back to my own experience this stuff and I [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=602.3399999999999s)]
*  Started to talk myself into being a little bit more comfortable with it [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=604.66s)]
*  But to answer your question like what are the considerations the first one is always will publishing this put someone in harm's way [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=608.86s)]
*  And you'll notice that in the discord leaks that have been published so far [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=615.5s)]
*  You're not seeing things like tank movements or you know [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=619.38s)]
*  Prospective tank movements even though those are probably in the document. So it stands to reason that there is somewhere a line and things are being held back [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=623.5400000000001s)]
*  But you also have to consider of course whether there are other negative real-world [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=631.4200000000001s)]
*  ramifications and that gets a little tricky because then you have to guess at the impact which means you have to guess what do other people [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=635.9000000000001s)]
*  Know and you think this information would be a surprise to Moscow [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=641.86s)]
*  I think that's one of the scenarios it would be potentially really dangerous because they could get freaked out by that and they maybe they feel [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=647.22s)]
*  Like they have to respond or maybe just the fact that it's now public. They feel like they have to respond [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=653.14s)]
*  I think it's probably unlikely that Moscow would be shocked by this partly because if these files are on a discord [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=657.58s)]
*  Server and the post has them probably Russia has them too. That does seem like a big open question, right? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=663.86s)]
*  I mean, I bet that is the presumption. Yeah, but it was like kind of a couple of niche discord sites [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=669.38s)]
*  I mean, you know Russian intelligence was no more destined to be there than US intelligence was right? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=673.98s)]
*  So I couldn't tell it's it's it's true and we can't you know, they can't call up the Kremlin and say hey [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=678.58s)]
*  Did you know? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=684.0600000000001s)]
*  So you have to do when and I've been in situations where you have stuff like this you have to do like [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=685.26s)]
*  projecting out a few steps and what do we think people know and they I think the thing that a [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=691.5400000000001s)]
*  lot of people are [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=698.3399999999999s)]
*  Upset about that. I think actually should not have been or should not be a consideration here [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=700.62s)]
*  I think probably wasn't was whether this would like hurt Zelensky [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=705.74s)]
*  Publicly or in Washington because like Russia could use it against him or his critics. He'd use it again [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=709.14s)]
*  So yeah, I mean I think that's a case for publishing because of Zelensky is pushing for attacking Russia [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=714.5s)]
*  That's really significant and that's the US intelligence who knows it. You're right. Yeah, the US intelligence already knows it [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=719.98s)]
*  I think there's a case for pulling the public into it rather than saying oh, you know, this could hurt him publicly and I [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=724.94s)]
*  Kind of came around to thinking [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=730.7s)]
*  It's on the edge [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=733.0200000000001s)]
*  But the people who this might lead to react in a negative way that would hurt people probably already knew about it [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=734.74s)]
*  And we're talking about like well, there might be a public backlash against Zelensky is like well [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=740.9200000000001s)]
*  Then maybe he shouldn't be suggesting attacking within Russia if he thinks the American public isn't gonna like that [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=744.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, or maybe it'll continue to encourage him not to do it. By the way, it's a lens [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=748.7800000000001s)]
*  Must be furious about this. I mean, he said that the White House hasn't called him about these leaks [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=752.3s)]
*  I don't maybe that means the CIA did or somebody else but boy rough for a rough couple weeks for that [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=756.42s)]
*  So I have heard that he is pretty unhappy with the post [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=761.8199999999999s)]

*  Evgeny per goes in our guy our guy per Goshen founded and runs the Wagner group [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1006.4s)]
*  It's a private army in Russia that has done a ton of fighting in Ukraine and parts of Africa [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1011.12s)]
*  Especially in bakhmut lately in Ukraine where the fighting has been the worst [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1015.9200000000001s)]
*  Pergosian has been very vocal about his frustration with Russian military leaders. He says they won't provide them with [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1019.96s)]
*  You know ammunition [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1027.16s)]
*  weapons equipment etc [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1029.16s)]
*  Last week the Washington Post reported that per Goshen has had ongoing [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1031.3600000000001s)]
*  Secret communications with Ukraine's military intelligence service and that at one point per Goshen offered to give Ukraine information about Russian troop positions [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1035.16s)]
*  If the Ukrainian military would agree to withdraw troops from the bakhmut region where the Wagner guys were fighting so wild wild [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1043.72s)]
*  It's really wild like so Ukraine apparently didn't take per Goshen up on the offer because they didn't trust him [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1051.4s)]
*  I wonder why but that has not stopped Ukrainian intelligence from taking per Goshen's calls and even meeting with him in Africa [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1056.02s)]
*  Something that per Goshen himself confirmed on telegram [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1062.08s)]
*  per Goshen also reportedly encouraged Ukrainian forces to attack Crimea and talked about Russian troop morale being low in certain places [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1065.6s)]
*  The documents seem to suggest that the Kremlin might know per Goshen's having these talks, but it's not totally clear [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1072.88s)]
*  Max when I saw this headline, I thought start the countdown clock until per Goshen falls out of a very tall window [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1079.64s)]
*  But maybe it's more muddled like what do you think do you think is he in deep shit here? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1087.3s)]
*  so we [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1092.14s)]
*  He's often been written about and Wagner's often been written about as this like shadowy private army run by Vladimir Putin [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1093.34s)]
*  And it's never really been quite the case. It's always been this kind of like [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1099.06s)]
*  Mercenary rogue actor who happens to align with the Russian state and to serve things that they need because they have real capacity problems [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1104.02s)]

*  But I think they have known for a long time that he is a total loose cannon who is out for himself [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1115.9s)]
*  Because he's been fighting with the Russian Defense Ministry for like a year and they're like really working to undermine them [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1121.74s)]
*  And they've been working to undermine him and they mean this is a like in some ways [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1128.1000000000001s)]
*  I like problem dates back to medieval Europe where would you have these private? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1131.8200000000002s)]
*  Mercenary armies they act for themselves. Yeah, that's very true [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1137.6200000000001s)]
*  Just last thing on the discord leaks [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1142.62s)]
*  I'm [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1144.3s)]
*  Previous reporting is alluded to this but the Washington Post wrote a long profile of the discord leaker this 21 year old member of the [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1145.08s)]
*  International Guard named Jack Tishara [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1151.22s)]
*  We learned in this that Tishara believed he was preparing for a war against black people liberals Jews in the LGBT community [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1153.26s)]
*  And that he was amassing an arsenal of guns and other gear for said war he had all kinds of conspiratorial beliefs [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1160.58s)]
*  He voiced his support for a number of mass shooters including the gunman from the Christchurch Massacre in New Zealand because the victims were Muslim [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1167.02s)]
*  The story once again raises serious questions about how this kid got a security clearance [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1174.54s)]
*  Especially since he was suspended from high school for making violent racist threats [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1179.8999999999999s)]
*  And we also learned that he posted more of these documents the classified documents on another even larger discord server [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1184.6599999999999s)]
*  So the universe of stuff that could be out there still seems vast [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1191.4599999999998s)]
*  It does it does make me wonder why was this stuff so widely available to so many people although [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1195.38s)]
*  Maybe the better question is why are people this like I'm sorry, but psychotic [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1201.9s)]
*  Yeah filling out these roles in the military and I assume the answer is just because you know [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1207.02s)]
*  Force exhaustion from 20 years of war and it's hard to get people to go for these because they're tough jobs [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1211.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know this guy this should not pass a bat. It's really shocking. Yeah, truly [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1216.66s)]
*  He's a video gamer which is that's the you know big-time gamer it does sound like you know [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1221.86s)]
*  I think he joined the military in 2019 during the pandemic these discord groups got really close maybe got more conspiratorial [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1226.74s)]
*  Maybe everyone went into their I mean I was I was I was in group chats during the pandemic things got a little dark in [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1233.1399999999999s)]
*  There yeah, things got dark [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1238.82s)]
*  I mean there was that period of time where it was fun and you're like [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1239.94s)]
*  Zooming with all your high school friends and stuff and then by like six months in I was like I can't do another [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1242.46s)]
*  Yeah, once at like nine months once we started becoming white nationalist insurgents [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1247.06s)]
*  That's the group chat was just so that also I should say I was kidding about he's a video gamer [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1251.46s)]
*  So therefore he's bad the gamers don't come after me. I'm pro gamers. We're all pro gamers here [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1255.94s)]
*  Okay, so enough about this guy or at least until we get to the Tommy Tuberville section [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1260.3s)]
*  So the the eyes the world oh eyes of the world it doesn't quite work [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1264.5s)]
*  We're on Turkey this weekend where president Taya Berduwan faced his most difficult [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1268.54s)]
*  Election in years against an opposition leader named Kamal [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1273.06s)]
*  Kilic to Rulu air to one got about 49% of the vote on Sunday Kilic to Rulu got about 45% [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1276.1799999999998s)]
*  Neither of them got 50% so they go to a runoff on May 28th [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1282.26s)]
*  Erdogan will likely benefit from the fact that this is now a head-to-head matchup [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1285.5s)]
*  Whereas before there was in particular another far-right nationalist candidate who got about 5% [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1289.26s)]
*  Presumably those voters would go to Erdogan Erdogan is seen as [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1295.54s)]
*  Politically vulnerable or was seen as politically vulnerable because of the government's botched response to the recent earthquake that killed at least [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1299.34s)]
*  50,000 people in Turkey and because Erdogan's economic mismanagement led to record inflation [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1305.54s)]
*  Many people around the world are also I think understandably quite worried about Erdogan's increasingly [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1310.6200000000001s)]
*  Dictator light kind of tendencies. Yeah dictator medium. Yeah, you could say yeah [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1315.42s)]
*  Itself seems to have been free but not necessarily fair because Erdogan to your point has so much control over the media [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1321.06s)]
*  So max Turkey is a NATO member. They're part of the g20 the US and Turkey have worked together closely on a lot of issues [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1327.5s)]
*  I remember going to Turkey with Obama and oh nine for example [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1334.6999999999998s)]
*  It was surprising to me to see news reports about how the United States was openly cheering for Erdogan to lose [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1337.54s)]
*  Given Erdogan's likely reaction if he won [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1345.1s)]
*  Can you help listeners understand why people are so eager to see Erdogan go? [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1347.4599999999998s)]
*  And I guess why the average listener should care about who the hell is running Turkey [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1351.58s)]
*  So this is I I would argue that this is regardless how the second round turns out the most important election [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1355.3s)]
*  This year is that crazy. Do you think no tell me what so? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1361.5s)]
*  The Erdogan story is I think such a fascinating one and it like tells us how we got here [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1365.26s)]
*  And I think it also tells us a lot about how the world has changed [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1371.06s)]
*  over the last 20 years and how we went from this era of optimism to one of a little bit more pessimism because [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1373.82s)]
*  When he first came into office in 2003 being the mayor of Istanbul [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1379.1s)]
*  He was widely seen as a good guy as this like force for democracy and progress and Turkey [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1383.1399999999999s)]
*  Was coming out of this long period of repression on off military role in Erdogan was seen as representing this like a new order of [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1389.0s)]
*  elections and popular legitimacy and he [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1396.44s)]
*  Expanded social services. He lifted a bunch of the country out of poverty. He expanded some personal freedoms [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1399.26s)]
*  He tripled GDP per capita, which is wild think about how much you would like Joe Biden if he tripled your [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1404.54s)]
*  Like net worth and you're yeah [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1411.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1413.18s)]
*  And he especially he modernized Turkey and these cities with these like huge huge construction boom and construction projects [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1414.6200000000001s)]
*  And he was pro EU [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1421.8200000000002s)]
*  He was pro Arab Spring when he was involved in and he was kind of remaking Turkey into this new [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1422.8600000000001s)]
*  regional power in the Middle East and like you probably remember that like arrow when we were like all kind of excited about Erdogan [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1427.8200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean we certainly I mean, you know [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1434.94s)]
*  I think it was Obama's first trip or one of his earliest trips included a stop in Turkey my [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1438.1s)]
*  My main memory from that trip was the plane breaking and us getting stuck there overnight [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1444.22s)]
*  So we actually got to do cool tour stuff and also cool walking around [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1448.76s)]
*  the then Turkish president home president ghoul [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1452.5s)]
*  With my colleague at the time my camera was another NSE spokesman who's now the special envoy for the Horn of Africa [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1456.58s)]
*  So he went on to bigger and better things, but um, he wishes he was hot. Come on [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1462.5s)]
*  But that's an interesting point because at the time the the president was a ceremonial position and Erdogan was the prime minister [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1466.58s)]
*  Everyone's a prime minister and then Erdogan changed the rules or change the Constitution to get president power [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1473.12s)]
*  And now he's the president right and the like yeah, so it's a 2008 is kind of a fascinating [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1478.06s)]
*  I think that's kind of the high water mark of like Erdogan as it's like [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1483.42s)]
*  Democratic reformer and this modernizer and everybody loves him and things started to really turn ten years in in [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1487.42s)]
*  2013 you probably remember like the big Gezi Park protests this like park in Istanbul [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1493.76s)]
*  Yes [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1498.8799999999999s)]
*  Started at this environmentalist rally against over development in the big cities but became eventually this wider backlash [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1499.56s)]
*  Among the urban middle class which has always been kind of Erdogan skeptical over what they saw as him [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1505.68s)]
*  Creeping towards rolling back some of the freedoms that he had once [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1511.3999999999999s)]
*  Championed and Erdogan cracks down really violently on these protests [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1515.48s)]
*  It's actually kind of a little bit like echoes of Moscow 2011 2012 [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1520.16s)]
*  Some of the protesters get hit with these bogus sedition charges and like 20-year prison sentences [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1525.2s)]
*  And this is kind of like the start of Erdogan slide [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1530.24s)]
*  Into this like elected strongman model that we now see so many of in the world and Turkish society starts polarizing [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1534.0s)]
*  But then a big step comes in 2016 when a bunch of rogue [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1540.3000000000002s)]
*  Military officers attempt a coup it fails but Erdogan out of I'd like opportunism or paranoia or probably both [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1544.3s)]
*  launches these like purges just [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1552.7399999999998s)]
*  77,000 people are arrested mostly on these like vague charges of political disloyalty [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1556.8999999999999s)]
*  He expels hundreds of thousands of civil servants from the government [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1562.76s)]
*  So guts his own government announces these emergency laws it takes over the courts [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1566.5s)]
*  He purges universities and civil society and he starts to become like a little wacky [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1570.18s)]
*  Yeah, you remember these like neo-imperial ceremonies [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1575.66s)]
*  He would hold like dressed up like a 19th century like Ottoman Imperial and he would like ranting [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1579.68s)]
*  We start with like conspiracy theories people would meet with them and say there's something off about this guy and [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1585.5600000000002s)]
*  Turkey starts to like feel like a police state started backsliding really hard in the opposite direction [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1589.8200000000002s)]
*  And then he like you said he blows up the economy because he's fired all the technocrats from his government [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1595.4599999999998s)]
*  And he's doing all this cronyism with these like guys and construction [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1601.3s)]
*  He's fantastically corrupt which is a big part of why when Turkey is hit by this big earthquake in [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1604.8999999999999s)]
*  February all of this construction that he'd overseen turns out to be just [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1610.58s)]
*  Insanely substandard because it was all through corruption and bribes it collapses kills 50,000 people maybe a lot more [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1615.22s)]
*  But they're like Erdogan is also he's terrible for Turkey which matters because 85 million people live there [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1622.9s)]
*  And it's also one of these both most beautiful countries in the world. I think yeah [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1628.5600000000002s)]
*  But it's also it's bad for Europe in the Middle East because Turkey is really involved in both and he's turned himself into this kind [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1632.3000000000002s)]
*  Of like geopolitical spoiler. He's getting close with [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1638.92s)]
*  Putin but I think more than anything else for me what matters about [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1642.3000000000002s)]
*  This guy [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1646.24s)]
*  Losing and why it is so important that he lose is that he really embodies this new global trend of the like [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1647.68s)]
*  elected leader who hardened into the strong man in office which is like [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1655.16s)]
*  Arguably one of the biggest threats we face in the world and like he's a leading case of it [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1659.0s)]
*  Orban and Hungary the Philippines and India and like Trump in the United States like these guys are like all of one piece [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1662.96s)]
*  And I think that's why all basically all of the democratic world is lined up in [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1669.0800000000002s)]
*  Wanting to see Erdogan and what he represents defeated which voters got really close to so close [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1674.72s)]
*  I mean that that 2016 coup attempt. I'll never forget watching that because I think you had [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1680.84s)]
*  fighter jets flying around the capital [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1684.8999999999999s)]
*  I think Erdogan was her face timing into the state TV network from his plane [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1686.8s)]
*  Delivering a message like go to the streets, you know fight them [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1691.84s)]
*  but yeah [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1695.1599999999999s)]
*  I mean did sort he did slide into autocracy and you've watched the US and really all Western countries kind of try to [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1695.82s)]
*  Recalibrate in real time. I mean the the US recently agreed to sell Turkey f-16 upgrades [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1703.36s)]
*  But they're also blocking Sweden from joining NATO Turkey is right. So there's the Greek it's push and pull constantly with this guy. He's [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1710.44s)]
*  He's not great and he's he's if he gets another four or five years. He's just gonna get worse [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1718.76s)]
*  Yeah, he'll probably do die in office at this point. Yeah [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1723.54s)]
*  I mean, it's it's kind of at this point where like I think it's easy to look at a strongman like this and say well [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1726.34s)]
*  Oh is a dictator so of course he's gonna win the election [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1731.2s)]
*  But the new like way that this electoral strongman works is there's usually a period of like 10 or 20 years [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1733.8400000000001s)]
*  Where they're slowly consolidating power where they still need elections and like like you said the vote itself looks like [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1739.92s)]
*  It was probably fair like the opposition party was watching the polls. They were watching the ballots come in [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1745.68s)]
*  They say it's fair [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1751.04s)]
*  But it's the other 364 days of the year when you know [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1751.74s)]
*  The state media is only covering him and ignoring the opposition [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1755.06s)]
*  You don't hear about the opposition because civil society's been gutted and there's this like climate of fear [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1758.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and decades of patronage and controlling the media and just sort of hard zero image [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1763.6399999999999s)]
*  Speaking of frenemies. Well, obviously we're gonna watch this one closely the runoffs coming up [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1768.3999999999999s)]
*  But speaking of frenemies max the US is now in this war of words of South Africa. The backstory is [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1771.6399999999999s)]
*  recently the US ambassador to South Africa did a press conference in Pretoria in the capital and [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1778.36s)]
*  Accused the South African government of providing weapons and ammunition to Russia for use in Ukraine [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1783.3999999999999s)]
*  The evidence was there was this cargo ship that was linked to a sanctioned [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1789.0s)]
*  Company that secretly docked at a naval base near Cape Town in December and got loaded up with something [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1793.6s)]
*  South African president sir Ramaphosa denied the allegations but also said he would investigate them what was happening his own [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1799.1599999999999s)]
*  So that didn't inspire confidence, but then sort of as this shitstorm is fully kicked up [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1806.1599999999999s)]
*  The Russian government this morning I believe or whatever time zone it was on [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1812.12s)]
*  Announced that the head of South Africa's army was in Moscow for meetings [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1816.52s)]
*  Conspicuous time. Yeah, the South African government said whoa [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1823.1599999999999s)]
*  This meeting was planned in advance of you know, you guys releasing these allegations [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1825.56s)]
*  Which I would argue was kind of the whole problem and the point right so [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1829.02s)]
*  Ramaphosa also suggested that Vladimir Putin might visit South Africa in August for the BRICS meeting [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1832.8s)]
*  So, you know the the official South African position on the war in Ukraine is neutrality [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1839.36s)]
*  I [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1845.6399999999999s)]
*  Doesn't feel so neutral. It feels less neutral, right? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1846.96s)]
*  I mean, what do you think going on here? [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1849.44s)]
*  Is this a look is is this the US reaping what it sowed and no one trusts us and our intelligence after Iraq 20 years [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1850.6399999999999s)]
*  Later is you know our South Africa playing some dirty games like where do you land? [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1857.6799999999998s)]
*  I so I think that this is something that is really specific to South Africa more specific than [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1861.72s)]
*  Like you're saying they kind of generalized his trust of the US or the West or they like we've talked about a lot on the [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1868.72s)]
*  Show the generalized global South [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1873.9199999999998s)]
*  skepticism of the Ukrainian side in the war [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1876.8s)]
*  You were in the White House in 2011 [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1880.48s)]
*  Do you remember the weird role that South Africa played in the Libyan civil war and the diplomacy around the Civil War barely so? [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1882.36s)]
*  even after [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1891.24s)]
*  Everyone in the entire world had lined up against Muammar Gaddafi's government because he was fighting this Arab Spring rebellion [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1892.6s)]
*  Like everyone in the African Union had lined up against him all of the other Arab states had lined up against was not just a [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1898.6s)]
*  Western thing South Africa was the one [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1904.04s)]
*  Holdout where they were still siding with him publicly even after he fell they were blocking at the UN [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1906.9199999999998s)]
*  recognition for the new rebel government and you talk to people in South Africa people knew South Africa they would say this is all about [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1913.3999999999999s)]
*  the anti-apartheid [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1919.48s)]
*  movement because Gaddafi had been and this will come back to Russia had been a huge backer of [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1921.04s)]
*  The anti-apartheid struggle personally and financially and the thing about the South African government [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1925.6000000000001s)]
*  It is still full of people who personally fought in that right? Yeah, so it's not even just like oh we all like a national debt [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1930.6000000000001s)]
*  It's like these are people who personally benefited from that or personally think that the entire [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1936.8400000000001s)]
*  South African nation as they know it owes a debt to Gaddafi and that is really true of South Africa's relationship with Moscow, too [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1941.1200000000001s)]
*  the Soviet Union was [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1947.72s)]
*  In the 70s and 80s a really big backer of the anti-apartheid movement now it was all [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1949.76s)]
*  Geopolitics, of course much as the US played cynical geopolitics. Yeah, right, right, right, but they [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1955.4s)]
*  They were training they would bring [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1961.72s)]
*  Anti-apartheid leaders including tabo and Becky who later became a South African president to Moscow for training [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1964.08s)]
*  They got it really involved in this proxy war in Angola that humiliated the South African government. So my [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1969.16s)]
*  sense is that this is a [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1974.44s)]
*  Continuation of this belief that like we South Africa as a nation and what we believe in really owes a debt to Russia [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1977.2s)]
*  And those are you know, they came for us or they helped us out when no one else would well that is fascinating context [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1983.8400000000001s)]
*  I mean, I wonder what this investigation will find about the the ship at the port and what was loaded up into it [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1988.88s)]
*  I mean does seem likely that you know if this was a sanctioned [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1994.8400000000001s)]
*  You know Russian entities ship that the US is probably watching it for a long time [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=1998.16s)]
*  I'm sure knows where it came from and knows where it went and maybe has a good sense of what was loaded up on it shocked [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2001.88s)]

*  We don't talk about Thailand enough here. We'd Thailand is fascinating. It's a fascinating place [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2283.14s)]
*  It's much more developed middle-class democratic than people know and it this election is huge. I'm really jazzed about it [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2287.66s)]
*  Okay, so we got this progressive move forward party [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2293.54s)]
*  They trounced two military-aligned parties currently running the government the coalition running the government [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2296.66s)]
*  I think the coalition in charge got like 15% of the voters something like that not do so well [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2301.9s)]
*  Move forward this new party's it promised to reform the military reform the economy and even to reform laws against criticizing Thailand's royal family [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2306.22s)]
*  Which is a big deal the move forward party grew out of these pro-democracy protests that started in 2020 in 2014 a military coup [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2313.82s)]
*  Ousted the elected government at the time and this is only the second election since then [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2322.3s)]
*  The other opposition party took second place in the most recent elections neither is enough seats in parlant to form a government outright [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2327.5s)]
*  So they got to cut a deal and form a coalition [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2334.06s)]
*  Next help us understand why you think this is such a big deal and why you are more optimistic than I am [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2336.22s)]
*  That these civilian leaders won't get you know pushed aside or imprisoned like, you know, democratically elected [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2342.54s)]
*  Governments in in Myanmar for sure [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2349.06s)]
*  So let me give you the like [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2350.86s)]
*  92nd history of Thailand and how we go because I just think it's it's a fascinating story [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2353.94s)]
*  So Thailand has always stood out from the rest of Southeast Asia. It's wealthier per capita. It has a big middle class [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2358.06s)]
*  It has these highly developed democratic politics [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2363.82s)]
*  But it also has more military coups in the modern era than any other country in the world and it's like not even close [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2366.7s)]
*  They have depending on you count it 13 or 14 well moves in the last year, which is that's a lot a huge number [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2374.12s)]
*  And it the military sees itself as playing this very unusual role in Thai society as and I'm not endorsing this as [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2380.44s)]
*  safeguarding Thai [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2388.16s)]
*  Democracy, which weirdly they actually helped to bring about in the first place their first coup in the 30s was to replace the absolute [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2389.72s)]
*  monarchy with a constitutional monarchy and what happens is the military ever since [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2396.16s)]
*  Steps in basically any time it thinks political turmoil is getting out of control [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2400.84s)]
*  So mass protests military coup political deadlock military coup and typically it hands power back to an elected government [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2405.76s)]
*  within a year or so [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2413.56s)]
*  But this system which was never great [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2416.1600000000003s)]
*  Started to yeah hot take hot take don't love regular military coups [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2419.48s)]
*  Started to kind of spiral out of control and the coups got way more common starting about [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2425.48s)]
*  20 years ago and there are two reasons for this one is that the Thai [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2430.28s)]
*  Monarchy which in theory is supposed to act as this kind of problem-solving mediator in politics [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2434.0s)]
*  Became much much weaker the king was getting really old and probably senile then he died in 2016 right his son took over [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2439.4s)]
*  Who is super unpopular which I can say because crooked does not have an office in Thailand [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2445.8s)]
*  But if we did I would have to be really careful about saying that you get like 15 years [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2450.64s)]
*  You could actually go to jail how do you say it late majesty? [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2454.28s)]
*  Less less majestic something like that. Yes something French [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2457.96s)]
*  I I got pretty close to season all of my French classes between the two of us will nail this one [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2461.44s)]
*  Yeah, anyway, don't go to Thailand insult the the king don't until these reforms get instituted [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2468.8s)]
*  So the second reason that Thai politics started to spiral out of control 20 years ago is they became super [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2473.64s)]
*  Super polarized for a long time the country's urban middle class were mostly in the south of the country pro-establishment pro-monarchy [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2479.2s)]
*  had dominated politics, but then [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2486.12s)]
*  2001 this guy who was really important in Thailand named Thaksin [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2489.4s)]
*  Shinawatra comes along and he starts organizing the rural poor who are mostly in the north and who are actually a slight majority the [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2494.52s)]
*  Population to get involved in politics, and I don't want to make it sound like I'm calling Shinawatra like a hero of the people [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2501.08s)]
*  He's this like billionaire businessman [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2507.24s)]
*  He's kind of an opportunist and he has a little bit of a flavor of the like [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2509.56s)]
*  Electoral strongman populace like we were talking about and when he becomes prime minister in [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2513.44s)]
*  2001 he starts amassing power for himself freaks out the political establishment who fight him in every turn and this sets off this cycle of [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2518.6s)]
*  unrest protests counter protests there'd be a coup then Shinawatra or like one of his many [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2526.48s)]
*  Family members would win power again in the next election and then there would be more unrest and then another coup society gets more and more [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2532.68s)]
*  Polarized and that leads the military to this coup that you mentioned the most recent one in 2014 to hold on to power [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2539.0s)]
*  Longer than usual and it directly rules until 2019 when it hands over [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2546.48s)]
*  Power to a civilian government under this new Constitution that makes it much easier for the military backed party to win [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2550.76s)]
*  Although the party did also get a plurality of votes in the 2019 election because Thai society is still really polarized [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2558.04s)]
*  And there's still a lot of skepticism about like straight democracy [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2564.2s)]
*  So it looked like this election this most recent one on Sunday was going to be a repeat of 2019 with the military back party [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2568.5600000000004s)]
*  Doing well Thai voters don't trust each other really polarized [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2574.5s)]
*  But that's not what happens this progressive party move forward kind of comes out of nowhere [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2578.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2583.76s)]
*  and wins this huge like you mentioned 36% of the vote which is huge when you have like [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2584.28s)]
*  10 15 parties running way more than any other party and the party that comes in second is actually fax in [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2589.48s)]
*  Sinowatra's party which is few Thai and the military part back party is a really distant third and this is huge [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2596.6000000000004s)]
*  I think for two reasons both of which I think if you're an American you should actually like be really excited about encouraged about the [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2602.6400000000003s)]
*  First is that the progressive party is this new? [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2609.04s)]
*  Third force that breaks the polarization in Thai politics and it gives Thai voters after 20 years of this [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2612.44s)]
*  Like demographic division really sharp division and distrust a way to come together [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2620.0800000000004s)]
*  And the second is the thing that it brings them together under that they're coming together for is is [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2624.4s)]
*  Democracy is to say whatever you know, whatever economic whatever religious divides we have [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2630.64s)]
*  We have this national consensus for we want to fight the military in the United States [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2635.76s)]
*  It might be something else who we're fighting in order to put democracy first and to protect democracy through [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2641.1600000000003s)]
*  This vehicle of the move forward [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2646.96s)]
*  Party and I think these are both just amazing developments that are worth cheering and worth getting excited about if you live in a country [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2649.64s)]
*  Say the United States where polarization and rising sympathy for authoritarianism like in Thailand in recent years is getting higher [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2655.96s)]
*  Yeah, and feel scary [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2662.12s)]
*  I mean so we should say this, you know, the the Constitution is still kind of rigged in favor of the military [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2663.04s)]
*  So they have a unelected 250 seat Senate that is chosen entirely by the military [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2668.56s)]
*  You have to get a combined number of seats to form a government [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2674.2s)]
*  That's just acts the deck against you, but hopefully it's possible here. But to your point [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2677.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean if we're you know, don't compare me to the Almighty compare me to the alternative as Joe Biden would say in neighboring [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2680.8399999999997s)]
*  Cambodia prime minister Hun Sen once again disqualified the country's main opposition party from running in the next election over [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2687.0s)]
*  ridiculous [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2695.3999999999996s)]
*  paperwork issues [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2697.0s)]
*  Basically, they said where is your founding documents and the opposition party doesn't have the founding documents because when the government raided their office [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2697.8799999999997s)]
*  They probably burned them up or took them or something back in the day [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2705.64s)]
*  So the the progressive party in Thailand actually got disqualified under similar nonsense made-up stuff in 2019 [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2708.48s)]
*  So I think the fact that the military [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2715.3199999999997s)]
*  You hate to give the time military credit for allowing elections to go forward because of course they should [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2717.92s)]
*  So I'm not saying they did because they're good guys [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2722.44s)]
*  But I think they felt pressure and felt like they had to allow elections to go forward in the sense among analysts [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2724.36s)]
*  Is that they will probably extract some concessions from the political parties before they give them the rubber stamp to say, okay [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2729.64s)]
*  You can form a government probably they won't change the less majestic laws or the less a majestic laws or whatever [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2736.2799999999997s)]
*  We're calling them [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2741.2999999999997s)]
*  But it seems like the time military is so allergic to unrest and protests and to being seen as a partisan actor [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2741.96s)]
*  I think it's very likely they'll let it go forward and then we'll probably see a change in the Constitution [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2748.7599999999998s)]
*  Big question is whether this new coalition of the progressive pro-democracy party and the populist [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2753.0s)]
*  Shinowatra party can create a kind of new [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2760.36s)]
*  Coalition in favor of democracy to avoid this cycle that Thailand has fallen into so many times for but I know you are a little [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2764.52s)]
*  Bit maybe less suddenly optimistic than I am. So what are you thinking? [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2770.28s)]
*  Listen, I just worry about the role that the guys with the guns play in all of these cases whether it's Thailand [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2774.0s)]
*  Sudan which we'll talk about in a little bit, you know Myanmar Burma, whatever you want to call it. So fingers crossed [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2781.16s)]
*  Yeah, I will I'm gonna stay hopeful here [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2787.56s)]
*  Yeah [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2789.72s)]
*  I will say that the Thai military does not have the record of the Sudanese in the Myanmar military of you know mass violence and [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2790.04s)]
*  You know shooting up huge numbers of people and I don't think they want to rule in the way the Sudanese military in the Myanmar [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2798.72s)]
*  Military, I think they want to have it. They're like it's it's kind of like when Egypt's military took over in 2011 [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2803.68s)]
*  They wanted to get rid of Mubarak [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2809.2s)]
*  They didn't actually want to run the country and they like threw away that hot potato pretty much as quickly as they could and then took [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2811.24s)]
*  It back again. That is good point. Look, we'll see. We'll see. Hope Springs eternal [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2816.2799999999997s)]
*  Back to the US max because you know, look democracy is is the best system we got but it's imperfect [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2821.16s)]
*  And one of the reasons is there is in Washington at least there's a constant brutal battle [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2827.68s)]
*  to be named the dumbest United States center and [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2833.3999999999996s)]
*  Wisconsin's run a race tight race. Yeah, Wisconsin's Ron Johnson. He's usually out in the lead [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2837.48s)]
*  Yep, but Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville has been coming for the crown lately [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2842.2s)]
*  Let's let him explain why in this clip you mentioned the Biden administration trying to prevent white [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2846.7999999999997s)]
*  Nationalists from being in the military. Do you believe they should allow white nationalists in the military? [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2853.96s)]
*  Well, they call them that I call them Americans [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2861.2999999999997s)]
*  We a little while ago talked about Jack Toshira who seemingly was a sort of Christian white [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2864.34s)]
*  Nationalists preparing for a race war while in the Air Force leaking tons of documents [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2869.94s)]
*  So it seems like it is a problem that it is in for Senator Tuberville should know about yeah [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2874.98s)]
*  The exchange itself came in response to questions about why [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2878.26s)]
*  Senator Tuberville is holding up the confirmation of literally all military nominations over the Pentagon's abortion policy [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2881.42s)]
*  So the Pentagon provides support for service members and their dependents who need abortion services [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2888.3s)]
*  But live in states like Alabama where abortion is illegal [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2893.54s)]
*  Even Mitch McConnell is on the record saying that this blanket military obstruction is a bad idea [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2897.38s)]
*  So a number of his colleagues [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2903.88s)]
*  In speaking of which President Biden is reportedly considering [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2905.9s)]
*  Reversing the Trump administration's proposal or plan to move the US Space Force Command from Colorado [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2910.02s)]
*  To a base in Alabama in part because of Alabama's total abortion ban [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2916.38s)]
*  So great work senator you are holding up the entire US military you are preventing your state from [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2921.34s)]
*  Getting jobs and a big influx of money because you are an idiot. Well done [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2928.2200000000003s)]
*  I mean it it's it's something that I feel like we have seen from [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2932.46s)]
*  Republican culture warriors since the 90s where it's there. They're [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2936.7400000000002s)]
*  Presenting it as it's like oh we have to protect the sanctity of the military and are fighting boys from the woke liberal Democrats [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2940.94s)]
*  But in fact what they are doing is [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2947.86s)]
*  First of all, nothing that they are calling a threat to the military is actually a threat to it [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2950.02s)]
*  I mean, that's you know, we found that over and over again [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2954.2000000000003s)]
*  They say oh no, if you allow gays in the military, then we won't be able to fight [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2956.3s)]
*  You know what you can fight just fine. I'm doing just fine before that women before that African Americans [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2960.26s)]
*  Exactly, right, right and then that he is at the same time in fact kneecapping the actual military that he claims to be [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2965.46s)]
*  Serving it actually like I don't want to get hyperbolic with this [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2972.38s)]
*  But this is something that was pretty common in like mid-century [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2975.94s)]
*  fascist European politics, I'm not saying that he is a [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2979.38s)]
*  European style fascist, but it was this common culture war thing to present the [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2983.3s)]
*  cultural sanctity of the military as this thing that had to be protected because the armed forces were the [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2988.98s)]
*  embodiment of the soul of the nation and they had to be the like [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2995.06s)]
*  Most traditionalist version of citizens that we could possibly imagine [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=2999.42s)]
*  So they would fight these crazy culture wars over who could be in the military and what they could be because it's a way [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3002.82s)]
*  To advance this like right-wing nationalist politics [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3008.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and look I remember it was not long ago [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3011.86s)]
*  Maybe a year or a year and a half were like people like Ted Cruz were retweeting these Russian [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3013.86s)]
*  Propaganda videos for military recruitment for their military and being like [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3019.98s)]
*  Oh, no [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3023.78s)]
*  If the woke US military ever goes up against these guys were cooked and then you know Ukrainian military delivers [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3024.1400000000003s)]
*  100,000 cash to them. So it is it's amazing to see how readily they will buy into the Russian propaganda that because [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3030.6s)]
*  Russia is a ultra conservative dictatorship [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3037.2799999999997s)]
*  Therefore the military is real manly men and that that is I guess what matters to them in terms of having an effective fighting [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3040.16s)]
*  Forces whether they have like the right cultural cues. It's just the dumbest thing in the world [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3046.0s)]
*  It's quite dumb a couple quicker things before we get to the optimism [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3050.4799999999996s)]
*  So last week Ben and I talked about concerns [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3054.04s)]
*  There would be this drastic increase in the number of migrants attempting to cross the southern border after the expiration of title 42 [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3056.68s)]
*  Which is a Trump era policy that allowed the US government to use public health concerns to expel basically everyone trying to enter the country [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3063.0s)]
*  But instead max the exact opposite has happened [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3070.4s)]
*  The US Border Patrol agents have seen a 50% reduction in attempted crossings [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3073.64s)]
*  The Secretary of Homeland Security says the reduction is likely because under title 42 migrants knew they would get expelled [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3078.44s)]
*  Yes, but then they could just try again [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3085.48s)]
*  And again and again and again till they got in now you face much harsher penalties including a five-year ban [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3088.16s)]
*  Potentially on reentry and maybe even criminal penalties [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3094.92s)]
*  So, you know max I assume the border crossing numbers will fluctuate over time. They always have they always will they'll probably increase [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3098.08s)]
*  For a variety of reasons but it is kind of remarkable how wrong the conventional wisdom was here including from Joe Biden himself [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3105.6s)]
*  Like us blaming the media, yeah, I'm curious what you think happened like was this just brilliant expectations management something else. I [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3112.84s)]
*  Mean, there's there's also been there's been a few changes in Central America itself, which of course [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3120.52s)]
*  That's where things actually happen that lead people to flee for the United States or not to flee for the United States [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3126.6800000000003s)]
*  El Salvador has arrested [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3133.4s)]
*  basically all of the male population of [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3137.0s)]
*  Certain adult ages and this like a really extreme effort to crack down on gangs [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3140.24s)]
*  Which has been effective at reducing violence, but it's not so great if you were one of the many many people [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3144.8799999999997s)]
*  arrested [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3149.8399999999997s)]
*  Mexico of course is [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3151.44s)]
*  At the United States behest doing a lot to stop [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3153.52s)]
*  migrants from reaching the border in the first place I [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3157.56s)]
*  mean [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3161.56s)]
*  To me all of this, you know, the numbers go up the numbers go down [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3162.8399999999997s)]
*  We change out one policy for another [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3166.8799999999997s)]
*  To me it feels like it's all basically the same policy which is extinguishing the right of asylum in the United States [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3170.24s)]
*  And they're like it's it's any it's taking place way in a way now that is a little bit more palatable [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3177.7599999999998s)]
*  And I think leads to fewer ugly incidents, but we've still basically killed the right to asylum [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3183.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean asylum laws were designed to comply with international laws and standards [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3189.7599999999998s)]
*  Sure, and you know in just law. I think the system [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3194.9199999999996s)]
*  Has gotten overwhelmed and it's not working [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3198.6s)]
*  It's in Trump and now President Biden have moved away from it and instead are creating these country by country [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3201.04s)]
*  humanitarian parole [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3208.36s)]
*  Numbers where they'll allow people in under certain conditions and they'll expel others [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3209.84s)]
*  and I totally understand those who [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3214.52s)]
*  Think it's wrong and believe that you know, we're basically shredding up asylum law and rights in real time [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3218.68s)]
*  But also the frustration for people in government who feel like well the status quo isn't working for anyone [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3225.2799999999997s)]
*  So we need to do something else. I also talked to some people in the administration [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3229.96s)]
*  one of the things they point out is that [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3234.08s)]
*  We talk all the time about like, you know what Congress is doing title 42 administration messaging [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3236.7999999999997s)]
*  But they say that the biggest problem they have [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3242.5s)]
*  Is disinformation in like telegram and what's up groups from smugglers? Yeah, we're just constantly [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3246.0s)]
*  There's an industry of trying to bring people up and bait them across and get paid [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3252.4s)]
*  Incredibly dangerous conditions, so yeah, I don't know we'll keep an eye on this one [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3257.8s)]
*  But it is kind of amazing that it just you know [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3261.44s)]
*  You had hundreds of cameras down on the border waiting for this crisis [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3263.48s)]
*  Right and in fact right wing outlets were using old photos from other countries to sort of right, you know present the image [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3267.52s)]
*  They wanted I do I you're absolutely right that the status quo was not working [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3274.1200000000003s)]
*  But I think it is I don't know it kind of underscores where we are that [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3279.92s)]
*  the thing that we are thinking about is the crisis at the border or the absence of a crisis of a border rather than [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3284.0s)]
*  You know why we have these international legal obligations to asylum because it's not just to be nice [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3289.88s)]
*  Although it is also like good to use your giant super wealthy country to help people who need it [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3294.9s)]
*  But it's also for the stability of the international system [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3300.02s)]
*  The US has been tearing up this right since the early [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3302.2999999999997s)]
*  1990s along with a lot of help from the Europeans and the Australians and that has an effect worldwide because then other countries follow and when you [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3304.9399999999996s)]
*  See a silent breaking down worldwide as it is under American leadership [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3311.9399999999996s)]
*  That affects huge numbers of people and it affects many conflict zones around the world to become more unstable as a result [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3315.5s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. I mean in viewing it as a crisis [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3321.2999999999997s)]
*  That's always this immediate thing that is happening now and not the result of long-term systemic changes or in many cases wars [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3323.3399999999997s)]
*  That the United States started or was a part of in places like Afghanistan or the Arab Spring or the climate crisis [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3330.22s)]
*  It has to be a global and systemic effort to figure out the next thing, right? [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3336.74s)]
*  I don't want to lay it all on Biden's feet [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3341.58s)]
*  I mean [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3343.14s)]
*  I kind of think our guy Obama was there like basically the only one who had any years in office where he was not [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3343.3799999999997s)]
*  Actively eroding the right to asylum. It's um, I don't know probably I mean there was a lot of deportation happening [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3348.8599999999997s)]
*  There was an effort, you know that kind of died in 2013 to get a comprehensive immigration reform [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3354.7799999999997s)]
*  package done right and then it just turned into Republican demands for [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3360.14s)]
*  border security [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3365.22s)]
*  Yeah, and the American people's opinions turned pretty harshly against welcoming people, right? It is true [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3366.06s)]
*  There's there is not a popular consensus in favor of asylum whatsoever. No, it's probably the worst polling issue for Democrats. I think out there [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3372.5s)]
*  Awful, we'll keep talking about though [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3380.1s)]
*  In Israel the Israeli government in the Palestinian Islamic jihad militant group reached a ceasefire after five days of fighting [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3382.1s)]
*  They killed 33 Palestinians and two people in Israel this round of fighting started when Israel bombed three [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3388.26s)]
*  Pijay commanders in Gaza killing them along with 10 civilians [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3394.5800000000004s)]
*  The Pijay responded with rocket fire and the fighting continued until the Egyptian government stepped in to help broker a ceasefire [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3398.0600000000004s)]
*  The good news, you know for the millions of people in Gaza for hundreds of thousands of Israelis [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3404.0600000000004s)]
*  Who have been terrified for the last week is that there's this pause? [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3409.1800000000003s)]
*  But you know big swaths of Gaza are once again leveled they probably won't be rebuilt as they weren't the last time [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3412.94s)]
*  There's no they can't bring in concrete. Yeah, there's no either. There's still a blockade [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3419.18s)]
*  There's no process in place to resolve all the underlying tensions that feed this tension in the fighting [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3422.86s)]
*  Hamas didn't get involved in this round that is seen as a good thing [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3428.38s)]
*  It probably helps shorten the timeline of the war itself, but you know, it's just a reprieve really [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3432.16s)]
*  Yeah, I am reminded of an Israeli expression that is sometimes used for their policy towards [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3436.34s)]
*  Gaza which I once got into a long conversation with an editor over whether we could even put it in the paper because it's so [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3444.6600000000003s)]
*  Horrible. Yeah mowing the lawn awful [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3449.86s)]
*  it's really right and that that is the policy and the policy is that you just [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3452.58s)]
*  You don't like you're saying you don't fix the underlying issues because you don't want to and you don't have to if you're Israel [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3457.38s)]
*  You build up a wall to insulate yourself from the consequences [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3462.38s)]
*  So all those consequences fall on people in Gaza occasionally [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3465.38s)]
*  Conflict springs up and then they mowing the lawn is you go in and or you don't go and you know launch missiles [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3468.94s)]
*  Whatever drone strikes and kill what you think is the appropriate number of people to stop the violence [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3475.32s)]
*  Yes, and expend their munitions right and expend their munitions. Yeah, not good [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3480.26s)]
*  Not good for the one some little good news for those who are worried about tensions between the US and China [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3483.94s)]
*  He was a sliver of good news Max. Oh, yeah, Jake Sullivan president Biden's national security advisor had two days of meetings with his Chinese [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3488.74s)]
*  counterpart in Vienna Austria [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3495.74s)]
*  They met for about eight hours. No one's suggesting this was like a big breakthrough [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3497.2999999999997s)]
*  But hopefully this you know relieved a bit of pressure that's been building up since the the spy balloon incident and other things [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3501.4199999999996s)]
*  Still no planned phone caller meeting between Biden and President Xi Jinping of China yet [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3508.3399999999997s)]
*  I'm really glad that you brought this up because this is [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3512.3599999999997s)]
*  This is the like maybe the most important thing that is happening in the entire world are the escalating tensions between [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3515.58s)]
*  US and China there's not like other than the balloon or some stuff [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3521.86s)]
*  There's not like a single moment to draw attention to it [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3525.3s)]
*  But if you talk to like people who are involved in foreign governments or people who are you know? [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3527.5s)]
*  Policy analysts around the world they are freaked out about this and US allies in Europe and especially in Asia have been [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3532.66s)]
*  Screaming for months that they are really really worried about how bad it's getting [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3540.54s)]
*  About how zero-sum it is how black and white and about where it's gonna go because no one seems to have an off-ramp for it [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3544.9s)]
*  Like people will go to China and they'll talk to policy people there and they'll say it's getting much worse much faster than we think [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3550.18s)]
*  and so [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3555.58s)]
*  Even if this is just a like Jake Sullivan dipping his toe in the water [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3556.54s)]
*  Maybe we have a conversation about having a conversation about potentially easing things back. That's great. Yeah, I'll take it, too [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3560.7s)]
*  Yeah, I'm there too anything to just chill out especially when the consensus to Washington is just hawkishness, right? [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3566.2599999999998s)]
*  bipartisan everybody, yeah [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3571.54s)]
*  Unfortunately, there's not a lot of good news from Sudan [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3574.1s)]
*  The Civil War there has been going on for about a month now [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3576.62s)]
*  The Sudanese military is fighting a paramilitary group called the RSF [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3579.22s)]
*  They used to be allies and friends and now they are at war. I've seen reports now that over a thousand people have been killed [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3583.62s)]
*  I'm sure that's an undercount the UN says 200,000 Sudanese have left the country another 700,000 have been internally [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3589.58s)]
*  Displaced by the fighting so we just wanted to update folks on that because we were leading with it for several weeks [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3596.14s)]
*  But it's just sort of status quo awful at the moment. Yeah [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3601.1s)]
*  So okay, that's bad news max your in-house optimist here. You said you had some good stories. I do I wanted to [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3604.3399999999997s)]
*  Use our time together both you and me and the listeners to come up with five [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3611.7799999999997s)]
*  Which is not even hard to find five really good things happening in the world that can make you feel good [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3617.42s)]
*  About being on planet Earth right now, right? So I'm gonna run through them. Okay, number one the Greek economy [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3623.46s)]
*  Remember when that used to be a punchline or the most horrifying thing you've ever heard for many many years [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3630.42s)]
*  thriving [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3636.26s)]
*  Thriving I didn't know that I I did neither well until I read about it [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3637.38s)]
*  6% GDP growth last year has been consistently outpacing the eurozone average and even double at some points [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3643.2200000000003s)]
*  Had a big rise in trade big rise in tourism. It's had a ton of foreign direct investment from Google Amazon Microsoft Pfizer [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3650.6600000000003s)]
*  Educated Greeks who left during the financial crisis are returning in big numbers and remember it was like [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3657.6400000000003s)]
*  The Greek financial crisis 13 years ago. It wasn't just bad. It was like [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3665.2000000000003s)]
*  Catastrophic like the country was cratering for people who are listening thinking. Why do I give a shit about Greece? [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3670.32s)]
*  I can't tell you how many meetings I sat in I bet with Barack Obama where people were his economic advisors and national security staff [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3674.52s)]
*  Were talking to him about the Greek debt crisis and the risk of default [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3682.14s)]
*  It was gonna pull down the entire EU. We thought it could crater the global economy again [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3686.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, right after the financial crisis you were the Germans and the French demanding that they cut their way out of [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3691.1s)]
*  the problem [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3697.14s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Greeks owed a lot of money to French and German banks, but I didn't really get talked about so yeah the fact that [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3698.5s)]
*  Greece is on its feet is a huge deal, right? [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3704.7400000000002s)]
*  And the Greek far-right that had been profiting from that so long is not doing so well anymore [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3706.82s)]
*  And they're having elections next week and it's either probably gonna be the incumbent government or left-wing. Syriza is going to win [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3711.14s)]
*  There we go show Italy how to do it [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3716.6s)]
*  Okay, here's good news in a place you might not be expecting it Iraq. Okay every year since [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3719.74s)]
*  2003 there has been a big wave of militant attacks during Ramadan [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3727.02s)]
*  This year was the first year in 20 years. It did not happen [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3732.2599999999998s)]
*  There was no mass violence by militants. Is there a sense of why? [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3737.14s)]
*  Let me give you a quote from a military blogger named Joel wing [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3741.14s)]
*  The insurgency which he refers to the Islamic States and all the other insurgent groups that have been operating there for so long [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3744.7799999999997s)]
*  The insurgency is a shell of its former self and it is isolated in the rural [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3750.66s)]
*  mountainous and desert regions of Iraq where it has become [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3755.5s)]
*  Irrelevant even though like sort of Iranian linked Shia militias that are that are kind of close to the government [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3758.8199999999997s)]
*  I mean a lot of them probably went and fought and died in Syria. That's true. Yeah, no things are I mean [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3763.58s)]
*  I'm not gonna say things are amazing there [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3768.66s)]
*  but the [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3770.2999999999997s)]
*  Just wrenching security crisis that Iraqis have lived with for you know for many of them their entire life [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3771.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm not saying it's over but that what was this marker of how horrible it was is looking a lot better [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3777.2999999999997s)]
*  And you know, I will be crossing my fingers that they will the country will consolidate that and turn that into some political progress [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3783.46s)]
*  That's great [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3789.66s)]
*  Here's one from India another place that usually makes me incredibly depressed and to read about a really big [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3791.38s)]
*  defeat for Narendra Modi's party the BJP in the state of [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3797.7000000000003s)]
*  Karnataka if you are not familiar with Karnataka because it is a very very small Indian state only 60 million people only two Texas [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3802.42s)]
*  It's India, baby [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3810.7400000000002s)]
*  BJP lost power in the state legislature in the most recent elections and now controls no state governments in the south [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3813.3s)]
*  And it is widely seen as specifically a [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3819.7s)]
*  repudiation of Modi who personally held 20 rallies there to try to win the election and especially of his brand of [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3823.06s)]
*  hardline [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3831.58s)]
*  authoritarian Hindu [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3832.98s)]
*  nationalism which he and his party had been pushing really really hard in advance of the elections because usually that works really well for them in [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3834.98s)]
*  elections doing things like banning Muslim girls from wearing head coverings in schools [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3841.02s)]
*  Which in the past has been very effective unfortunately for the BJP in winning support from Hindus by whipping up some tearing texans [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3846.46s)]
*  So probably this is not representative all of India. Southern India is kind of its own thing in a lot of ways [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3853.94s)]
*  It's still very popular in the north, but it is a really good sign that at least this big part of India and this big state [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3859.82s)]
*  looked at this model of [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3867.62s)]
*  Hindutva of extremism that has been gathering so much momentum in India and said no, we don't want any more of this [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3870.14s)]
*  That's great, especially since not long ago [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3875.62s)]
*  Indian court decided to throw in prison or offer a jail sentence to the leading Congress Party opposition leader, right? [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3879.06s)]
*  Yeah at a time when so many trends are unfortunately pushing in the wrong direction. It is nice to see Indians pushing back [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3886.18s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. Okay. This is working. Yeah, it's working on this right a little happiness. Yeah [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3891.58s)]
*  Okay number four. This one is it's gonna be a little controversial [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3896.18s)]
*  I will couch what I mean when I say that this is good news the United Nations had its first official [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3900.46s)]
*  commemoration of what Palestinians refer to as the Nakba or the catastrophe which refers to the [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3907.58s)]
*  1948 that's 75 years ago [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3913.62s)]
*  1948 mass expulsion and departure of 700,000 Palestinians from the territory that is now controlled by [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3916.06s)]
*  Israel [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3924.4199999999996s)]
*  The event itself I would say I'm not endorsing in its totality Mahmoud Abbas the Palestinian leader had some things to say that [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3925.54s)]
*  We're not so great [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3933.14s)]
*  but I think it is [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3934.82s)]
*  good, not just for the Palestinians, but frankly also for [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3936.86s)]
*  Israelis to have [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3941.14s)]
*  Recognition of [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3944.74s)]
*  Palestinians trauma as well as traumas like the Holocaust that led to the creation of Israel because [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3947.38s)]
*  Not just because I want to see the Palestinians get recognition in itself [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3952.54s)]
*  Although I do but also because I think that is just important for peace and for moving things forward [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3955.8199999999997s)]
*  So that these two peoples can try to understand each other, you know, I really I don't get why Israeli officials [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3960.66s)]
*  Lobby so hard against events like this like for example the Israel's UN ambassador said [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3969.9s)]
*  attending this despicable event means destroying any chance of peace by adopting the Palestinian narrative calling the [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3975.66s)]
*  establishment of the state of Israel a disaster and I feel like we're kind of [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3980.94s)]
*  Getting stuck on an adjective a description of an event that for if you have a little empathy for the individuals involved [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3985.7000000000003s)]
*  If you got pushed out of your home, you would probably feel very badly about that event [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3993.6200000000003s)]
*  The the interpretation that's happening here is the suggestion that it's anti-semitic because denying [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=3997.46s)]
*  That the state of Israel should exist itself. But what I would argue [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=4004.82s)]
*  Yeah, I think this is commemorating history right and that [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=4009.82s)]
*  you know [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=4014.5s)]
*  You're destroying any chance of peace by not having peace negotiations [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=4016.1s)]
*  I mean, this isn't this event isn't gonna change any facts on the ground and I will say with you [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=4019.06s)]

*  Some of the Israeli government's rhetoric to Nazis and that's obviously an insane thing to say and totally offensive [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=4025.14s)]
*  Yeah, and he should stop he's done that before and it doesn't help him. It doesn't help the Palestinian people [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=4030.7400000000002s)]
*  He hurts his own cause by doing this but at the same time like I don't think any of us should be in the business of [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=4035.86s)]
*  denying historical events well, I mean I think the [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=4041.6600000000003s)]
*  Israeli and it's not blanket Israeli opposition, but the Israeli government's opposition to recognizing this is about right of return [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=4045.46s)]
*  I think absolutely as if you acknowledge that it's it that it was bad [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=4052.5s)]
*  That's 700,000 Palestinians who now have millions of descendants many of them living in [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=4057.5s)]

*  then you might have to talk about whether they can come back and they don't want to have that conversation because they want to maintain a [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=4064.3799999999997s)]
*  Clear Jewish majority in the country for sure. It's just such a logical leap to suggest. Oh, yeah saying [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=4070.02s)]
*  Yeah for an individual who lost their home that is bad means we have to acknowledge the right of return [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=4075.1s)]
*  It's gonna be part of a final status negotiation. No matter what these sort of questions and in the US, you know [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=4079.22s)]
*  if the negotiation happens if it ever happens the US, you know, I think [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=4084.2999999999997s)]

*  In the US Congress, but I'm with you. I think like a little more open and less [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9L0DjAIdrA&t=4094.38s)]
