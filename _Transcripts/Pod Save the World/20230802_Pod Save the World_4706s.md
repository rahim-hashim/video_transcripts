# Why is Niger's Coup Fueling Even More Tension Between Putin & The West?
**Pod Save the World:** [August 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU)

*  I'm Jack Smith. Yeah bus [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=15.8s)]
*  Interesting, let's go it goes but we have a great show for you guys today [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=18.8s)]
*  We're gonna cover this military coup in Niger and why it could have wide [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=22.68s)]
*  Reaching massive implications the latest news from Ukraine reports about a potential [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=28.32s)]
*  US Israel Saudi diplomatic deal a terror attack in Pakistan democracy in Southeast Asia [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=33.44s)]
*  And how to convince the world to take action on climate change as we live through [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=38.72s)]
*  Potentially the hottest year in recorded history. It's hot out there. It's a fun one to say you were a part of. Yeah [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=43.36s)]
*  Well, at least it's a record that you know will be broken, you know [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=49.56s)]
*  That's right Ben [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=53.2s)]
*  And then I talked with US Ambassador-large for global criminal justice [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=54.56s)]
*  Beth Van Shock about prosecuting Russian war crimes [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=59.04s)]
*  Ben and I were just chatting before we went it's like [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=63.08s)]
*  one of the best parts about working in government is you won't really have [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=65.32s)]
*  Had a lot of meetings about say war crimes and then you'll go in and you'll meet the expert on the NSE or a state [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=69.32s)]
*  Or something and it's the smartest subject matter expert maybe in the world on that matter [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=74.4s)]
*  And that's kind of what the conversation I just had felt like that [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=78.92s)]
*  That's the kind of person that we want to bring to you on this podcast, you know, yeah, exactly exactly [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=81.36s)]
*  Should we turn to Niger? We should turn to Niger. Okay, so Western Africa [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=86.48s)]
*  The military Niger stage the coup and deposed to President Mohammed bazoom [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=91.32000000000001s)]
*  In fact, I believe it was his own presidential guard who did this to him [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=96.08s)]
*  Yeah, he was about to can the guy who ran the presidential card, which is usually [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=99.6s)]
*  Something that can lead to coups [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=104.52000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but now the presidential guard the military is holding him captive [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=107.28s)]
*  Bazoo was the first elected leader in Niger to succeed another elected leader since the country gained independence in 1960 [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=111.96s)]
*  So this is a huge setback for the 25 million people in the country and democracy in the region [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=118.32s)]
*  Generally in there there aren't a lot of bright spots for democracy and in the Sahel [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=124.52s)]
*  So in response echo was which the union of 15 West African states [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=128.24s)]
*  They initially sent a delegation to try to mediate and resolve the crisis diplomatically that didn't work [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=132.56s)]
*  So they announced sanctions and a no-fly zone over Niger and issued an ultimatum to the coup leaders [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=138.24s)]
*  Saying you have one week to reinstate president bazoom or else echo was will quote take all measures necessary to restore [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=143.6s)]
*  Constitutional order in the Republic of Niger such measures may include the use of force [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=151.44s)]
*  In response to that statement the leaders of other coups who now run molly and Burkina Faso [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=156.48s)]
*  Said they would view any echo was intervention in Niger as a declaration of war against them as well [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=163.48s)]
*  so this quickly went from a coup in one country to potentially a [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=170.48s)]
*  regional conflict and one that would be another de facto proxy war between the US in the EU [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=174.76s)]
*  And the Russians and the Wagner group who are backing the coup leaders [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=181.12s)]
*  Meanwhile like the levels of food insecurity and child malnutrition in West Africa are rising [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=184.96s)]
*  It's difficult to get assistance in because the Sahel region is plagued by a growing Islamic extremist threat including al-qaeda and Isis offshoots [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=189.68s)]
*  According to the global terrorism index the Sahel region is now the epicenter of jihadist violence in 2022 [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=198.36s)]
*  There are more deaths from terrorism in the Sahel than in South Asia the Middle East and North Africa combined then [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=203.68s)]
*  15 years ago the region accounted for 1% of deaths from terrorism. So these coups are part of the problem [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=210.2s)]
*  They lead instability and economic hardship [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=215.07999999999998s)]
*  In the conditions that lead to terrorism and also the coup leaders push out counterterrorism forces from places like France [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=217.6s)]
*  They welcome in the Wagner group the Wagner group doesn't give a shit about terrorism [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=224.27999999999997s)]
*  They care about protecting the person they're propping up who's in charge and you know, their mineral interests their gold mines, etc [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=227.72s)]
*  They kind of end up controlling [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=234.56s)]
*  Niger had become one of the last places where the the US the French the EU were allowed to have [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=237.24s)]
*  Counterterrorism forces now that partnership is at risk. So Ben [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=244.68s)]
*  Obviously like we talked about way too many coups in Western Africa on the show. Unfortunately, they're very bad every time but this idea of a [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=249.6s)]
*  regional fight between [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=257.4s)]
*  you know ECOWAS and [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  The couped countries is very scary it is [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=262.35999999999996s)]
*  There's a lot going on here. I mean first of all, this is just yet another [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=267.08s)]
*  strike against [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=270.84s)]
*  Democracy rule of law in this part of West Africa. We've seen this string of coups [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=272.84s)]
*  Which again for people that may be somewhat [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=279.03999999999996s)]
*  flabbergasted by this [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=284.4s)]
*  You know, I remember talking to somebody in Mali [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  Who surprised me because they were kind of you know, small-d Democrats civil society type person [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=289.46s)]
*  But they actually worked for a time for the coup leader after the coup and and this guy's point to me was [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=295.53999999999996s)]
*  Hey, look, you know [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=302.09999999999997s)]
*  We're sick of corruption [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=304.09999999999997s)]
*  We're sick of the French like jerking us around [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=306.09999999999997s)]
*  Generationally these coup leaders are you know, not not this guy but like some of these coup leaders are younger [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=309.85999999999996s)]
*  Some of these coup leaders are younger and a lot of them in their 30s. Yeah a lot of them in their 30s [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=314.98s)]
*  They got in Burkina Faso's 35, I think [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=318.9s)]
*  So just so people understand like there's some [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=322.06s)]
*  For some of these coups, there's there's some kind of broader rationale. I still think it's obviously wrong [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=326.1s)]
*  This one is a little different because there's more like this guy's about to get canned and just made his move [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=333.46s)]
*  You know, but it does speak to just a kind of collapse of governance in this part of Africa [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=337.34s)]
*  Another point is like the French [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=344.42s)]
*  French farm policy not exactly having a banner banner time in West Africa [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=347.22s)]
*  No, these are most of these are former French colonies where the French have a big military presence [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=351.58000000000004s)]
*  Or a big development presence and there's a kind of very clear [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=358.38s)]
*  Through line of fuck you to the French on this stuff that and understandably. Yeah, which again is is [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=362.70000000000005s)]
*  you know McCrone needs to be taking a look at what his Africa policy has been because [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=368.06s)]
*  Some this is built up over decades [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=372.38s)]
*  So it's not just on the Crohn but like that that's another notable piece of this [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=374.46s)]
*  But I mean you honed in on like the key point here [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=378.06s)]
*  Which is I don't remember there being this kind of threat of interstate conflict in West Africa like this at all [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=380.58s)]
*  You know and and to see you know, the the leader of Mali I saw [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=385.9s)]
*  You know, he went out and made a statement in which he repeated himself three times any military [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=392.02s)]
*  Intervention against Niger is tantamount to a declaration of war against Burkina Faso and Mali [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=396.94s)]
*  So there's this like coup [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=402.14s)]
*  Axis like you mentioned and that's you know, one it's clearly splitting echo us [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=403.74s)]
*  Which was one of the used to be one of the better functioning regional blocks [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=409.41999999999996s)]
*  in fact echo us I remember back in the Obama years was essential to [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=413.82s)]
*  preventing a coup in Cote d'Ivoire when [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=417.85999999999996s)]
*  This guy Bagbo you remember this guy tried to hold on to power but but you know here we have a real risk [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=421.7s)]
*  of conflict between states [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=427.65999999999997s)]
*  With kind of a an avowed agenda of undermining democracy by one of the groups of countries involved [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=430.38000000000005s)]
*  And and again to bring back a segment we haven't had in a few weeks the World War Watch, you know [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=437.82000000000005s)]
*  When when there are superpower conflicts, you know [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=444.02000000000004s)]
*  They can spread to all parts of the world because superpowers have interest in all parts of the world [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=448.26000000000005s)]
*  You know, that's obviously what happened in the previous world wars and here we've got already [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=453.26000000000005s)]
*  A Russia US or Russia West conflict in Ukraine, but we also see that [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=458.7s)]
*  informing the flashpoint in Iran and now we very much see this in in West Africa because [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=464.34s)]
*  you know the rush is not behind this coup, but they're very opportunistic and [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=471.78s)]
*  you know when we were looking at the Wagner group and we're [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=476.62s)]
*  Cruising towards a special episode before per Goshen [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=480.53999999999996s)]
*  Delivered our special episode through his muni [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=483.4s)]
*  I was calling around talking to some Africa analysts about how to think about what Wagner does in Africa and their point was [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=485.88s)]
*  Well, they're opportunistic. And so if there's like an opening in a Mali [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=493.08s)]
*  They'll try to get a foothold there so that they can then use that as a base to spread to a neighboring country like a Niger [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=498.04s)]
*  Right. And so we very much see that here where Russia via Wagner [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=504.15999999999997s)]
*  Likely to be coming in trying to gain more influence if the US which has a bunch of troops in Niger [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=510.08s)]
*  You know suspends its military assistance Wagner will be right there saying hey, no strings attached with the Russian military assistance [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=515.8s)]
*  We're more than happy to help your crew and it doesn't take like [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=522.34s)]
*  Billions and billions of dollars in military aid to be helpful to people like this, you know, it can be [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=526.16s)]
*  guns it can be [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=532.08s)]
*  disinformation campaigns it can be [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=533.68s)]
*  Special forces capabilities Russia has less of that because a lot of it's in Ukraine [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=535.8s)]
*  But a little bit could go a long way for for somebody who's you know running a coup in Niger [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=539.88s)]
*  There's a big piece in the New Yorker this week about per Goshen [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=544.3599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and the mutiny insurrection whatever you want to call it [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=547.52s)]
*  And it's it's really comprehensive in the way it sort of details the rise of Wagner sort of being through Africa [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=550.68s)]
*  They got to Sudan in 2017 the Central African Republic in 2018 [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=557.52s)]
*  Wagner forces fought in Libya with Haftar this warlord they fought in Mali [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=562.48s)]
*  They fought in Syria and you know that the sort of game plan here is you get around the leader you protect him [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=567.88s)]
*  You train security forces and then you take control of say in Syria [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=575.28s)]
*  They would attack oil and gas sites controlled by Isis defeat Isis and then [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=580.32s)]
*  Wagner would take the revenue from the oil and gas [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=586.0400000000001s)]
*  It was a win-win for Bashar al-Assad because Isis would kicked out of some, you know part of the country [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=588.4599999999999s)]
*  But also a huge boon for a Wagner economically. Yeah. Yeah and [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=594.7199999999999s)]
*  They can they can generate their own revenue through corruption or through natural resources [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=600.06s)]
*  Niger has these huge stocks of like uranium. That's not something seven percent of global uranium. Yeah, it's not great [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=606.14s)]
*  that goes missing [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=612.3s)]
*  Some people could like rightly point out that the the intervention in Libya and the removal of Qaddafi and the kind of chaos that in [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=614.3399999999999s)]
*  Sudan, Libya [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=621.3399999999999s)]
*  contributed to some of this rise of [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=622.66s)]
*  The flow of people across borders and the advance of extremism jihadists [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=625.02s)]
*  I guess I I would also say though that you know, Libya was unraveling before the intervention [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=629.54s)]
*  I mean there was kind of a civil war there but but also what you see here too is [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=635.5799999999999s)]
*  You know the the lack of any [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=639.78s)]
*  Governance and the exploding youth populations in places like this also [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=642.1s)]
*  Attract extremism as well. So there's a lot of factors that have contributed to this [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=647.42s)]
*  persistent threat of violent extremist groups operating across this to hell [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=652.86s)]
*  but nonetheless [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=657.6999999999999s)]
*  opening for Wagner [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=659.4599999999999s)]
*  and a huge [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=661.4599999999999s)]
*  contagion around democracy [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=663.3399999999999s)]
*  Going the wrong direction here. Yeah, and this becomes a really hard question for the Biden administration [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=665.6999999999999s)]
*  It already is about whether they will call what happened in Niger a coup it obviously was but once you say that [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=669.9s)]
*  It forces the US government to cut off certain types of assistance, especially military assistance. And as you mentioned the US [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=677.3000000000001s)]
*  Opened a drone base in Niger in 2019 [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=684.9s)]
*  It cost a hundred million dollars 30 million a year to maintain and it's become kind of like the last beachhead [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=687.58s)]
*  For counter extremists work in the region and I'm not I'm not suggesting that they should the Biden administration should not call it a coup [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=693.0200000000001s)]
*  But there will be these balancing of interest that will lead to tortured press briefings [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=700.6600000000001s)]
*  Like we saw during the Obama administration about whether to call the coup in Egypt a coup [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=704.34s)]
*  Yeah, I'm always in favor of calling things a coup. I was back then I am now. I mean it is a coup [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=709.82s)]
*  I don't think we should be giving you know military assistance to [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=714.86s)]
*  Armies to carry out coups it sends kind of the worst possible message [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=720.38s)]
*  I'm not trying to diminish the you know, the competing interest of not just having a counterterrorism interest [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=724.5799999999999s)]
*  But you know the idea that if we pull out, you know, the Russians move in and all the rest of that [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=732.38s)]
*  But but the end of the day, I mean you got to kind of stand for something and you know a coup like this, you know [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=737.26s)]
*  It's not a close call. No in terms of what happened couldn't be more obvious. Yeah what happened? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=743.86s)]

*  Save the world Ben. Let's talk to about the other sort of US Russia proxy war that's happening in Ukraine [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=914.48s)]
*  So the latest news is that President Biden has agreed to give evidence about Russian war crimes to the ICC the International Criminal Court [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=919.8000000000001s)]
*  I'll get into that in more detail in the interview, but in terms of the counter-offensive [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=927.0s)]
*  President Zelensky announced that the Ukrainian military had recaptured a small village in southeastern Ukraine [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=931.16s)]
*  Called staromyrsk. It took about ten days of really brutal combat to do it [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=937.84s)]
*  But the Ukrainians believe this could lead to larger breakthroughs, even if they're taking huge losses [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=943.08s)]
*  Meanwhile Ukraine is continuing to use drones to attack inside Russia [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=947.96s)]
*  Drones hit a skyscraper in Moscow that houses Russia's Ministry of Economic Development twice in two days pretty remarkable [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=952.8000000000001s)]
*  And Russia said that Ukraine was targeting their ships in the Black Sea with sea drones [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=960.4s)]
*  The New York Times actually did a big spread on Ukrainian drone capability that was interesting and interestingly timed [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=964.76s)]
*  but one thing it said was [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=970.76s)]
*  The uj22 drone can fly 500 miles [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=973.0s)]
*  So it's like very much puts Moscow in their crosshairs and Zelensky all but confirmed that they were behind these strikes [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=976.24s)]
*  Usually they play kind of coy but now he's saying things like [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=982.8000000000001s)]
*  Attacks on Russian territory are quote inevitable natural and absolutely fair [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=985.8000000000001s)]
*  So, you know Ben last week we also talked about the withdrawal [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=990.5200000000001s)]
*  Russia's withdrawal from a deal that allowed Ukraine to export grain through the Black Sea [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=994.1600000000001s)]
*  Ukraine is now going to try to export that grain via Croatia [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=997.48s)]
*  Hopefully that works Saudi Arabia is hosting peace talks about Ukraine later this week Jake Sullivan [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1000.24s)]
*  The National Security Advisor is gonna go along with I think officials from Europe China Brazil and India, but not the Russians maybe [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1005.0200000000001s)]
*  So we'll see and then again, you know, we talked about per Goshen and Wagner and the mutiny [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1012.08s)]
*  Wagner was supposed to be a lot of people thought he'd be dead by now, but he's supposed to be in Belarus [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1017.9200000000001s)]
*  But instead he was spotted at Russia's summit with African leaders last week in st [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1022.4000000000001s)]
*  Petersburg there's a picture going around with him and someone from the [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1027.88s)]
*  Propaganda protocol protocol protocol and propaganda probably [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1031.88s)]
*  central African Republic so [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1036.04s)]
*  A lot going on there anything else you want to flag and give any hope for these Saudi peace talks [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1038.3999999999999s)]
*  well [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1043.1599999999999s)]
*  first of all the per Goshen thing is interesting in light of what we were just talking about because [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1043.6s)]
*  Why is he alive? [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1047.3999999999999s)]
*  Well, one reason we've talked about is that Putin wants to integrate Wagner fighters into the Russian effort in Ukraine [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1048.52s)]
*  But another reason is that per Goshen knows where all the operations are in Africa. He's got all the books [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1054.72s)]
*  He knows who's on the payroll [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1061.18s)]
*  He knows where you know, the mining interests are all the rest of it and it may be that if Putin wants to have this kind [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1062.8000000000002s)]
*  of influence into Africa [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1069.48s)]
*  And he clearly does he's summoned this summit in Russia that a bunch of African countries are at right now [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1071.2s)]
*  and he needs them to kind of run interference and [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1078.8400000000001s)]
*  International votes and to continue to kind of be a foothold for Russians narrative in the global south like [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1082.0s)]
*  Pergosian is important to that effort [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1087.6000000000001s)]
*  and so the fact that he's hanging out at summits that are hosted by the Russian government [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1089.16s)]
*  Speaks to kind of the the fact that you know, he could get away with literally murder [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1093.76s)]
*  I mean they were shooting down Russian army helicopters. I [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1098.68s)]
*  Think that we've mentioned this before [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1103.16s)]
*  like [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1106.0800000000002s)]
*  not just saying this to point out that we were [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1107.5600000000002s)]
*  predicting this but [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1111.68s)]
*  The fact that as the counter-offensive stalls the Ukrainian [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1113.76s)]
*  willingness and interest in striking deeper into Russia seems to go up is a real trend to watch because [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1119.04s)]
*  Your point about Zelensky is an important one [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1126.08s)]
*  It used to be like something would blow up in Russia and there'd be like a weird statement from like the presidential office [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1128.2s)]
*  It was like, you know things when times go yeah [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1134.16s)]
*  Yeah, when dogs lie down with fleas they sometimes get sick or like this [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1137.04s)]
*  Truly the fact that they're just now like owning it [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1142.32s)]
*  I mean it does speak to this point that the longer this goes on the more things could escalate inside of Russia and [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1145.0s)]
*  Frankly the idea that the that no Western already we've seen reports that the Western supplied weapons have been used in cross-border [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1151.1599999999999s)]
*  attacks frankly if the US is providing [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1159.0s)]
*  Weapons and the Ukrainians are using those weapons inside Ukraine and other weapons inside of Russia [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1162.4799999999998s)]
*  I'm not sure that's much of a distinction anyway, like so some of these escalation guardrails are already kind of [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1167.3999999999999s)]
*  collapsing a bit, you know, and and the question is, you know [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1173.52s)]
*  Does that normalize and Russia just has to absorb that cost of war? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1177.6399999999999s)]
*  I'm sure what the Ukrainians are trying to do is make the cost evident to ordinary Russians and create a climate of fear [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1180.7199999999998s)]
*  They're also to just get revenge what's happening in their country. But what happens if you know something [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1186.6399999999999s)]
*  Kills a bunch of civilians and and you know, this could get [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1191.84s)]
*  Murky pretty quickly. So that's something that I definitely watched the Saudi peace conference [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1195.28s)]
*  I don't hold up a lot of hope that that's going to produce a peace deal [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1201.04s)]
*  It feels a little bit more to me like Saudi public relations [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1206.0800000000002s)]
*  accompanying their [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1211.5600000000002s)]
*  You know massive asking price for the normalization deal that we'll talk about here. So [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1212.96s)]
*  I'm not sure that that there's gonna be peace in our time because of the [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1218.44s)]
*  Midsommar [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1222.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's worth pointing. I think that at this summit of African countries in Russia [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1224.0800000000002s)]
*  Putin pledged to ship them free grain for over the next four months [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1229.76s)]
*  So he's trying to do some cleanup work about the black sea grain initiative PR challenges and the cost of food [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1233.0s)]
*  Two other reports just if folks want to read more [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1238.68s)]
*  The New York Times had a pretty depressing story about how bad of a job the UK is doing when it comes to sanctions enforcement [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1240.8400000000001s)]
*  Against pro Kremlin oligarchs and they also had an interesting piece about Russia's efforts to improve ties in Asia [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1246.64s)]
*  Got Putin going to a conference in China in October and then Sergei Shoigu the much maligned [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1253.28s)]
*  Defense minister of Russia had the red carpet rolled out for him in North Korea last week. So fun crew [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1259.8400000000001s)]
*  yeah, well the crazy thing about that it's worth like googling the show you visit North Korea because [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1266.1200000000001s)]
*  one thing Kim Jong-un did is he put up like [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1271.72s)]
*  Pictures of Putin everywhere like on the same scale as him. Yeah, so it's a super creepy weird stalker shit cult of [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1274.52s)]
*  Personality around, you know the strongman Kim the strongman Putin [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1282.96s)]
*  But I mean it is a bit of a window into global politics in 2023 that that's it's not that outside of the mainstream [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1286.8s)]
*  That kind of strongman worship, you know thing [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1294.36s)]
*  so I [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1297.32s)]
*  Guess the one thing to watch there though is it? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1298.6s)]
*  The Russians need all the weapons they can get the North Koreans do have a lot of these kind of small arms and artillery [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1301.28s)]
*  Artillery and stuff so like they could actually be you know, it's funny. They've been the recipient of all this Russian [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1307.12s)]
*  Support over the decades like they could actually be a source for the Russians now [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1313.1599999999999s)]
*  the North Koreans need cash [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1317.4399999999998s)]
*  And the Russians need artillery and you know, it's pretty straightforward deal match made in hell [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1319.84s)]
*  So you mentioned this normalization deal so Jake Sullivan the other part of this trip presumably is to talk to [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1325.3999999999999s)]
*  MBS or others about this normalization agreement potentially between Saudi Arabia in Israel [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1331.3999999999999s)]
*  Tom Friedman from the New York Times wrote a big piece about this potential deal last week that [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1337.92s)]
*  Triggered me into the stratosphere. Yeah [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1344.0s)]
*  So the gist was Friedman says Biden is deciding whether to pursue a deal where the US gives Saudi Arabia a NATO like security [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1346.8s)]
*  Guarantee where the US agrees to defend Saudi Arabia if they're attacked a civilian nuclear program and much more advanced US weapons systems [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1354.58s)]
*  In return the Saudis would have to normalize relations with Israel and the war in Yemen [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1362.34s)]
*  Give more support to Palestinian institutions in the West Bank [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1366.82s)]
*  I assume just cash and stop budding up with China the Israelis basically give up nothing [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1370.06s)]
*  They have to agree not to annex the West Bank and they have to agree to preserve talks with the Palestinians and a sort of [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1375.3799999999999s)]
*  a process around a two-state solution [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1380.4199999999998s)]
*  The Palestinian Authority says to bless the normalization deal here the reasons I think this is a bad idea first [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1382.5s)]
*  As we talked about before you're giving Netanyahu a huge win in the middle of this effort to gut the courts [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1387.94s)]
*  Second, I don't know Mohammed bin Salman seems like a kind of a homicidal dictator [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1393.3000000000002s)]
*  Maybe don't give them a nuclear program or like fad missile defense systems and then [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1397.54s)]
*  He's you know, he likes to butcher journalists. We should probably factor that in and then [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1402.6200000000001s)]
*  Again with the Saudis like we could end the war in Yemen by just cutting off military support there, right? [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1407.1s)]
*  So there's pressure and they want it the Saudis want in the war in Yemen [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1412.6599999999999s)]
*  They're this is not a real concession. They they went out of that war anyway, but it's not going anywhere [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1415.6999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and then you know by judging by where you cringed in sort of the lay down there [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1420.82s)]
*  I just imagine this is your biggest beef with it like me. Well, let's not rank our beefs. I just yeah [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1425.06s)]
*  So like all these Abraham Accord deals, they've completely leave out the Palestinians [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1431.26s)]
*  Yeah, right if this deal created a Palestinian state I'd be like, oh interesting, but it doesn't it normalizes like the process of [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1434.54s)]
*  Pretending to talk so it also like the column. I don't mean to be hard on Tom Friedman [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1441.86s)]
*  He's a nice guy and a smart guy, but the no no he deserves in this case [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1447.1399999999999s)]
*  It epitomizes he is a nice guy, but he this this column is crazy. Okay, fair [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1450.54s)]
*  Yeah, it epitomizes like treating this Israeli government is normal [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1454.6599999999999s)]
*  Here's one as if it's like 19 if it is if this is happening like the year after Oslo [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1457.74s)]
*  Yeah, so it says Net Yahu's ruling coalition of Jewish supremacists and religious extremists would have to answer this question [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1461.78s)]
*  You can annex the West Bank or you can have peace with Saudi Arabia and the whole Muslim world [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1466.66s)]
*  But you can't have both so which will be [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1470.3799999999999s)]
*  Tom buddy you answered your your your hypothetical in there. They're religious extremists [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1472.3s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, and and the answer too is both, you know, like like so there's so many things in this column done pack [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1477.06s)]
*  I mean, I I won't double-dip on what you talked about [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1483.52s)]
*  First of all, there's a Friedman part [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1488.06s)]
*  Which is like his conditions that he talked about for the Palestinians [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1490.62s)]
*  Were like that the Israeli government promises to never annex the West Bank [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1495.98s)]
*  first of all [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1501.26s)]
*  What is that promise worth? Yeah, like seriously like it like they could they sure they could say that out loud [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1502.5s)]
*  But does anybody believe that they're gonna keep that promise as they continue to build settlements has continued dislodge Palestinians [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1509.34s)]
*  Then there was stuff about like moving more parts of area C in the West Bank [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1515.42s)]
*  Which sounds like that every single peace process that has always talked about it never really happens if you're still under military occupation [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1520.7s)]
*  You know giving a little bit more, you know, it's just such a weird outdated [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1528.5800000000002s)]
*  Frame of reference and then this idea of Saudi payment, you know, like a huge Saudi assistance program [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1533.5400000000002s)]
*  Let me tell you where that's gonna go [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1539.46s)]
*  That's gonna line the pockets of a bunch of Palestinian Authority types who have bank accounts in the fucking Emirates [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1540.98s)]
*  You know, like like it's just gonna boomerang back to the Gulf [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1547.1s)]
*  You know, nobody actually believes that that money is going to build like, you know roads and schools and hospitals [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1549.74s)]
*  In the West Bank and so this is such a tired formula [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1556.82s)]
*  Like it is nothing about a final status issue. It is nothing about the creation of Palestinian state [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1561.5s)]
*  It's like promise to not annex it and you know some money changes hands and [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1566.56s)]
*  We act like we're doing something with the Palestinians when in fact we're like rolling the bus back over them, right? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1572.52s)]
*  So nothing in that column to me suggest anything like a real substance that the Palestinians are getting right? [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1577.8s)]
*  That's one thing then it's like [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1585.6s)]
*  the the mutual defense pact, you know [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1587.92s)]
*  That we can come back to this if this deal gets signed and really break this down [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1591.48s)]
*  But like the questions I have are [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1595.2s)]
*  Are you really gonna tie a US president to being compelled to come to the aid of Saudi Arabia like a NATO member state? [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1598.56s)]
*  Not just now [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1607.0s)]
*  Ten years from now 20 years from now 30. Is this like a permanent like [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1609.2s)]
*  Sounds like what on earth is Saudi Arabia gonna be like in 20 years [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1613.8s)]
*  Like what if the royal family becomes more autocratic and and there's an internal uprising [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1617.3400000000001s)]
*  What if they go and pick a fight with Iran and then ask us to come to their aid [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1622.92s)]
*  We don't even have a mutual defense treaty with Israel and we're getting this is Saudi Arabia. Never mind. It's being totally non-democratic [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1626.24s)]
*  Mutual defense back by the way, what are we getting out of that? [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1633.2s)]
*  Like is is Saudi Arabia gonna come to our defense in Taiwan contingency, you know, like like it's just it's [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1635.64s)]
*  You mentioned Taiwan. It does seem like you know concerned in the White House that Saudi Arabia is increasingly [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1642.6000000000001s)]
*  You know budding up to China seems like it might be driving most so this is so [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1648.6000000000001s)]
*  The big question that I've always had about this is what's in it for the US because we know it's in it for Israel [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1653.6000000000001s)]
*  They get normalization [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1659.92s)]
*  BB gets this huge political win. Yes, we know what's in for Saudi Arabia [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1661.8400000000001s)]
*  They get a nuclear program and a mutual defense pact and weapons and all I mean [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1666.0400000000002s)]
*  They their price is insanely high on this thing. And so what's in for us? [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1671.0800000000002s)]
*  I believe if you read the fine print that what the US is really concerned about is a geopolitical [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1675.44s)]
*  Reorientation of Saudi Arabia to China and so if they can somehow kind of lock Saudi Arabia out of that [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1680.6399999999999s)]
*  You know enlist them in our export controls, so they're not investing money in Chinese technology at a time of AI arms race [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1687.3999999999999s)]
*  Okay, that's that's actually more substantive and I'd want to see what that is [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1694.8s)]
*  The question I have on that is how binding can that be because again MBS could say all the right things today about [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1699.96s)]
*  Sure, I'll go along with your export controls, but then you know five years from now ten years from now [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1707.4s)]
*  He could just change his mind. He's got trillions of dollars [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1712.2s)]
*  You know are they Saudi Arabia bound to something like we are going to be bound to this mutual defense pact if this happens [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1715.24s)]
*  What are they are they actually bound to something that if they violate it they no longer get that mutual defense package for instance [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1722.72s)]
*  The nuclear program. I don't know why we have to give that to them. They can buy nuclear energy, you know, like I guess [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1728.52s)]
*  So it's just there's a lot to this the last thing I want to say is just some people are like [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1733.8799999999999s)]
*  Why on earth would the Saudis and the Israelis do this? [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1737.9199999999998s)]
*  You know, they clearly want Trump to win. Why wouldn't they just wait and the reason for that is that? [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1740.8799999999999s)]
*  The the Saudis know that if if Trump is president, let's say and they make this deal [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1747.6399999999999s)]
*  The US Senate would have to ratify mutual defense treaty which is wrong for Biden too, by the way. Yeah, it's [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1754.8s)]
*  There's no chance that any Democrat would ever vote for that fucking thing if Trump made the deal [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1760.52s)]
*  So I think they're like, well, maybe we can bank this [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1765.52s)]
*  you know with the you know, Biden whipping the Democrats and the Republicans voting with us because of [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1768.28s)]
*  APAC and the Israelis [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1773.52s)]
*  Which is a pretty cynical [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1775.8000000000002s)]
*  You know thing right? I don't know. What do you like? What do you think about the communication strategy? [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1778.2s)]
*  I've kind of there's been a lot of reporting on this but like really like rolling this out to Tom Friedman [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1784.0s)]
*  Great question. I mean, I think like you probably assume [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1789.92s)]
*  He is someone who's been thinking about writing about the Middle East peace process for a long time [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1793.64s)]
*  It's long been conventional wisdom that solving that problem would unlock this broader rapprochement within the US and the Muslim world [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1799.64s)]
*  Again, I don't think as you've said that that this deal is offering that outcome [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1809.0800000000002s)]
*  but he seems to think that it could be some game changer in terms of [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1813.72s)]
*  Israeli relations with the broader Muslim world or US relations the broader Muslim world forgetting that often [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1817.64s)]
*  Leaders of autocratic countries don't really reflect the views of the population. Yeah. Well, yeah exactly. I mean that [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1824.16s)]
*  This kind of presumes a certain legitimacy and MBS to speak for the entire Muslim world [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1832.08s)]
*  I thought it was like clearly that they Biden seemed to want to do that [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1837.1200000000001s)]
*  Like why else would he have Tom Friedman in and kind of you know, that's a good question [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1842.0s)]
*  I mean there could be that there also could be the I the trial balloon or what? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1846.12s)]
*  I mean, we'll be calling Friedman to push back on BB and then it's Biden. So it ends up being an hour [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1850.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. I mean, I I didn't know where there was a trial balloon for like a lead opinion, right? [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1855.8799999999999s)]
*  Cuz Tom Friedman is a good like mainline into a certain vein of a lead opinion in the foreign policy and business world [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1860.9199999999998s)]
*  And Friedman gave the best possible spin on this thing, right? I [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1868.28s)]
*  Just still don't think Americans are tracking [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1873.72s)]
*  Like, you know, the mutual defense thing would be a fascinating debate to watch play out in Congress [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1877.44s)]
*  Because I do think that a lot of Democrats would have [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1883.1599999999999s)]
*  Real concerns about voting to permanently have a defense pact with Saudi Arabia on the other end. They'd have some [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1886.84s)]
*  Trouble voting down a president or party heading into the election year [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1895.36s)]
*  It's a complicated piece of business politically and I I worry that it just because it's being socialized in an elite opinion [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1899.92s)]
*  Like I don't know what you know, probably 99% of people have no idea this is happening, right? [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1907.72s)]
*  Yeah, the the sub reductive political calculus is like, oh, yeah, you like Trump's Abraham Accords [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1912.4s)]
*  Well, I got an even bigger Abraham Accord with the Saudis [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1917.8000000000002s)]
*  But that that kind of ignores the reality that we're giving a lot more with the mutual defense packs [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1920.2s)]
*  Yeah, and I just don't think the Abraham Accords [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1925.28s)]
*  Is like an entire Middle East policy it's it's a policy [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1928.16s)]
*  It's an autocrat and BB like I just I don't know [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1933.28s)]
*  I don't like either also the US media is addicted to doing softball interviews with BB Ninjago [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1937.3999999999999s)]
*  He was on Wolf Blitzer the other day. I was like, god damn it. He was on like NPR too. I think I heard [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1941.48s)]
*  Yeah [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1946.16s)]
*  well [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1946.48s)]
*  the Israeli press gets so pissed because he goes around them by doing US media interviews and gets [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1946.8s)]
*  Is able to reach his base without getting any of the tough like getting much easier questions and he would have gotten with the Israeli press [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1952.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's inferior. Yeah, so Ben the trajectory for democracy in Southeast Asia is not looking great [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1959.46s)]
*  There's Cambodia where Hun Sen the Prime Minister slash dictator since 1985. I won [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1965.4s)]
*  illegitimate let's say let's call them the other illegitimate parliamentary elections that he locked out any opposition and then he said three days after he [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1972.28s)]
*  Won that he's gonna hand power over to his son. Yeah, so that's not great in Thailand [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1979.92s)]
*  There was hope that Peter Linjaroen rat and the movement forward party would take power [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1984.42s)]
*  But that hope is fading after he was blocked by the military [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1989.96s)]
*  The military runs Senate and he was suspended from Parliament [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1993.88s)]
*  Remember we talked about Peter and move forward party a while back in May. They won the most seats in the election [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=1996.6000000000001s)]
*  He then cobbled together this multi-party parliamentary coalition, but ultimately [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2002.28s)]
*  Couldn't get installed as Prime Minister because the process is just rigged by the military in their favor [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2008.26s)]
*  One-third of Parliament is appointed by the military [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2014.02s)]
*  So now the former Prime Minister says he's gonna return to Thailand from exile on August 10th in hopes of breaking this deadlock [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2016.18s)]
*  Then any hope here that the democratic process could wrestle away power from the time military [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2023.7s)]
*  Well, I mean first of all the Hun Sen thing is like that guy was one of the creepier guys [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2029.22s)]
*  I was in the room within government like I was in a room with a lot of creepy people [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2033.48s)]
*  But this guy is like an old [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2036.9s)]
*  aging autocrat corrupt guy [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2039.18s)]
*  and and you know not even making bones about just like handing off to his son like as if this is [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2042.0600000000002s)]
*  Like a familial dynasty like North Korea or some shit, you know, like that's not it's not great [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2048.3s)]
*  I guess what I'll say in terms of the hopeful side is if you look at if you look at Thailand the elections [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2053.44s)]
*  You know were resounding rebuke of the established kind of military [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2058.5s)]
*  Royalist, you know our talk soft autocracy that has evolved there this move forward party like [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2063.2599999999998s)]
*  More progressive small-d Democrats younger political leadership drew a ton of support [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2070.7799999999997s)]
*  And I guess like if there's a silver lining across the region [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2078.06s)]
*  I'll come back to Thailand a second. It said there really are like these movements like in Cambodia [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2081.74s)]
*  There's actually a pretty healthy opposition despite efforts to quash [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2086.12s)]
*  You know civil society independent journalism over the years [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2089.7799999999997s)]
*  There's this kind of milk tea alliance across the Asia Pacific where younger people are finding solidarity with democratic movements in different countries in [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2092.66s)]
*  Myanmar we have like a brutal military government. You still have like a [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2100.74s)]
*  Like a really like a both a peaceful and an armed resistance to that [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2105.8999999999996s)]
*  As the government bombs and burns [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2110.74s)]
*  Civilian yeah, just indiscriminately. So so you what's what's weird about Southeast Asia is yeah, the trends are not good [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2113.54s)]
*  but yet the resilience of democratic movements continues and [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2120.5s)]
*  With Thaksin the former prime minister coming now. What's interesting here is that he is this billionaire who? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2125.66s)]
*  Weirdly draws a ton of populist support and anytime he's been able to run an election. He's won [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2131.9399999999996s)]
*  He's been exiled from the country for a long time [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2137.2599999999998s)]
*  Even after he was exiled his sister was elected prime minister like back in the Obama years [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2139.78s)]
*  then she got kind of kicked out but he tends to draw a lot of support and [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2145.5s)]
*  Presumably when he goes back they'll arrest him [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2150.7000000000003s)]
*  But he's stepping into this political impasse and I think what he's trying to do is look like the [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2152.98s)]
*  Majority of people in Thailand do not like this government and they either like to move forward party like Thaksin [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2158.7000000000003s)]
*  And I think the potential for there to be a real rift in Thai society and there already is but like [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2163.94s)]
*  It gets more pronounced in the aftermath. This election is very real and there could be bigger [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2169.38s)]
*  democracy protests and this will come back to the US too because guess what they're a mutual defense treaty ally of ours, too and we've [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2174.6200000000003s)]
*  Had the tortured conversation about whether they call things coups there [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2181.94s)]
*  I think that the US should be trying to get much more involved here in support of Thai democracy [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2184.86s)]
*  which may cut against our like, you know, Indo-Pacific anti-China strategy, but like [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2191.46s)]
*  This is not stable in Thailand like this is not a recipe for stability to be backing people with diminishing support [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2196.66s)]
*  While there are these growing democracy move. Yeah to your point look what happened in Myanmar [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2203.86s)]
*  horrible news that a Pakistan then where there was a [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2208.94s)]
*  Suicide bomber who detonated a bomb at a political rally in northwest Pakistan that killed 55 people and wounded well over a hundred more [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2211.62s)]
*  This rally was for an ultra conservative Islamist party [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2218.1s)]
*  That is part of the current Pakistani government coalition and known to have ties with the Afghan Taliban [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2221.9s)]
*  The ISIS affiliate in Afghanistan took credit for this attack ISIS thinks that the Afghan Taliban are conservative enough [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2227.7400000000002s)]
*  Then they're not implementing a conservative enough vision of Islamic law. She's probably the power struggle to [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2235.02s)]
*  Pakistan is scheduled to have a general election October. So there's real concern about what this does the political process [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2241.38s)]
*  the area where this attack happened KP province has dealt with [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2246.38s)]
*  Near weekly terrorist attacks from both the Pakistani Taliban or TPP and ISIS [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2251.38s)]
*  Both want to take over and establish Sharia law things have basically gotten steadily worse in Pakistan the security situation since the US withdrawal from Afghanistan [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2258.26s)]
*  At the time political leaders in Pakistan were celebrating the Taliban takeover, you know [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2267.98s)]
*  They sort of like removing the yoke of oppressors and understandably so but now the Afghan Taliban is providing a safe haven for [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2273.02s)]
*  The TTP much like Pakistan once provided safe havens for extremist groups fighting US forces in Afghanistan [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2280.46s)]
*  So it's just an ugly circle [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2287.2200000000003s)]
*  compounding the problem [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2289.06s)]
*  Is the fact that five thousand TTP fighters were brought back to Pakistan from Afghanistan as part of a rehabilitation? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2291.06s)]
*  Program that has just completely failed. So a lot of those guys are now back in the fight killing people so [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2299.54s)]
*  Pretty bleak picture here. The only sort of hopeful news I heard [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2306.38s)]
*  Out of the area is that US officials are holding their first talks with the Taliban government for the first time [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2309.7799999999997s)]
*  Since the US withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021. I think they're happening in Qatar. So maybe they'll find some kind of [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2317.18s)]
*  Pathforward. Yeah, I mean on Afghanistan [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2324.7s)]
*  I would hope that that can lead to some opening in the sanctions to just reduce the humanitarian suffering in Afghanistan [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2326.94s)]
*  I think on Pakistan the two things I just say are the first thing is it like this proves how [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2333.02s)]
*  Short-sighted and [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2338.2200000000003s)]
*  Self defeating the Pakistan policies been for so long. I mean they the ISI the intelligence services their [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2340.26s)]
*  elements of the military [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2348.6600000000003s)]
*  Obviously provided safe haven for the Taliban [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2350.38s)]
*  A lot of my Afghan friends, you know would call it a de facto [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2352.9s)]
*  Pakistan invasion right in terms of what happened with the [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2357.2200000000003s)]
*  the Taliban taking over [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2361.02s)]
*  Never mind that they also supported some extremist groups inside of Pakistan and places like Kashmir like [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2363.46s)]
*  Alaska Altaiba like the [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2369.66s)]
*  This is the dog that caught the car [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2372.86s)]
*  If you if you lay in bed with extremists for decades you and look the US was a part of that way back in the 80s [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2374.9s)]
*  obviously funding some of the stuff in Pakistan to fight the Soviets but like [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2381.78s)]
*  This is gonna happen if you create a safe haven for extremists [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2386.22s)]
*  They're gonna boomerang back on you because you're never gonna be you know transaction enough for them [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2390.14s)]
*  The other thing to watch I think just going forward is that there's this political instability in Pakistan since Imran Khan was essentially ousted [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2396.14s)]
*  As prime minister we've talked about that but there's supposed to be an election later this year [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2402.58s)]
*  This fall so you're gonna have this period of time usually in the past. We've seen [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2406.7799999999997s)]
*  Election seasons in Pakistan be accompanied by more terrorist attacks [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2411.8599999999997s)]
*  And so the thing to look at is do both Isis K this off-street devices and [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2415.6s)]
*  And the Pakistani Taliban do they do they launch more attacks in the run-up to that election? [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2422.32s)]
*  I think the answer that is probably yes. Probably yes. Yeah [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2427.68s)]
*  So then changing gears here. We're recording this on August 1st [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2430.7200000000003s)]
*  July seems to have been the hottest month in recorded history [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2434.48s)]
*  2023 will likely end up being the hottest year [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2438.68s)]
*  It's clear that global warming is a huge driver of [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2441.4s)]
*  These temperature increases we are seeing the impact all over the world the study published in the journal nature estimates that the [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2445.84s)]
*  Heatwave in Europe in 2022 killed more than 61,000 people [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2453.88s)]
*  These heatwaves disproportionately impact vulnerable isolated marginalized groups. This one in particular killed more women than men oddly [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2459.16s)]
*  Then you flagged a story about how a rock is about to be uninhabitable [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2467.76s)]
*  Yeah, because of climate change and scarce water resources were likely to see more conflicts because of those scarce resources soon [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2472.2000000000003s)]
*  But what's I think? [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2478.76s)]
*  For depressing is that this hasn't led to a surge in action or sort of like urgency [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2480.8s)]
*  In fact, you're sort of seeing the opposite in a lot of places. Yes the UK [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2486.2000000000003s)]
*  The British Conservatives just hung on to a seat in Parliament by making the election about [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2490.9s)]
*  Demagoguing and anti-pollution law and now it seems like labor is going soft on a lot of their climate commitments [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2496.38s)]
*  President Macron of France called for a pause in the EU's climate agenda the German government nearly collapsed over [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2504.26s)]
*  Heating system regulations a lot of this obviously is like dealing with energy scarcity because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2511.82s)]
*  But you're hearing the term green lash get thrown around about what's happening and so pretty dumb fucking time for a green light [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2518.5s)]
*  Yeah [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2525.3s)]
*  Yeah [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2525.7400000000002s)]
*  And so what's clear is like these extreme weather events and the predictions that they're gonna get worse aren't [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2526.2400000000002s)]
*  Waking people up and I was reading [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2532.7s)]
*  Lydia Keesling's novel mobility and it made me wonder if there are if we just need to find a new way to reach people [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2535.14s)]
*  You know, maybe it is fiction [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2541.38s)]
*  Maybe that's the way to get people to empathize with the impact or to [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2543.06s)]
*  Envision the future and what things could be like if we truly, you know [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2549.1s)]
*  Get past the point in a return in terms of emissions because like people are getting third-degree burns from sidewalks in Phoenix [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2553.66s)]
*  and it's not [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2561.58s)]
*  Leading to some massive rethink of all of our climate policy and there probably should be yeah [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2563.7799999999997s)]
*  To your point, you know [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2569.2599999999998s)]
*  It's pretty evident that the more dire predictions of climate scientists are coming true and that it's gonna be unpredictable [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2570.98s)]
*  It's just gonna it's going to be the worst-case scenarios like that [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2577.98s)]
*  We've what we've got enough data now to understand is like the the more benign predictions are not happening [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2580.7s)]
*  The the more aggressive ones are proving, right the Iraq thing [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2587.66s)]
*  you know, what's interesting about that is like because of extreme heat and the nature of the geography like [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2592.2999999999997s)]
*  Parts a huge swathes country kind of uninhabitable but part of what this story also highlighted to me is [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2598.7000000000003s)]
*  that the geopolitics of this are gonna become more and more complicated because essentially [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2605.7000000000003s)]
*  Part of the reason Iraq is so screwed [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2611.86s)]
*  Is that you know Iran Turkey and other countries that they need water too and Turkey controls some flow of this water [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2614.7400000000002s)]
*  And they're upstream and what you realize is that geopolitics and this gets to your question like geopolitics [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2623.14s)]
*  Is usually a moral already? I mean something I've been like battling against in my own life, you know [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2630.46s)]
*  but like [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2636.74s)]
*  Countries tend not to do the right thing [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2637.8999999999996s)]
*  and so if there are bigger countries that have access points to water and [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2639.48s)]
*  Will be able to screw poor countries to solve their own water problems [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2644.94s)]
*  They're probably gonna do that. And so I think what that Iraq story highlighted is the extent to which we're gonna continue to see [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2649.22s)]
*  Cut marginalized countries get screwed, you know as as bigger countries kind of like, you know swallow up the water resources [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2656.2599999999998s)]
*  and then within countries as you say marginalized populations getting screwed and [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2664.8599999999997s)]
*  That the political incentives even in democracies where you'd think public opinion would be putting pressure on politicians to show will is [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2669.58s)]
*  Is not there like credit to Sadiq Khan by the way in the UK cuz like it was his [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2677.3s)]
*  It was his efforts to kind of reduce [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2683.62s)]
*  Emissions that can shoot building out of Boris Johnson idea. Yeah, yeah [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2686.94s)]
*  Amazingly, yeah, and and he dug he doubled down on it and he's right like he's gonna be proven right by history [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2691.7s)]
*  You know now, what does it mean? I think you're right [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2697.5s)]
*  I there need to be other conversations to get people culturally [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2700.14s)]
*  Invested in this because that can lead to other kinds of pressures right like the pressures on fossil fuel companies [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2704.46s)]
*  Around things like divestment around things like denying, you know companies providing their services to fossil fuel [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2712.26s)]
*  Come like there has to be kind of an all-hands-on-deck [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2718.58s)]
*  Pressure point to make this transition to cleaner energy [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2721.18s)]
*  That is gonna have to go beyond [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2724.22s)]
*  Sitting around and waiting for like the overton we hear to change on politics. We're we're past that it's too late for that [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2726.82s)]
*  You know, we need we need to be throwing everything at this [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2733.22s)]
*  Yeah [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2736.24s)]
*  It's just like you got UNESCO [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2736.62s)]
*  Recommending that Venice the city in Italy be put on a list of endangered World Heritage sites [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2738.02s)]
*  Because the seas are rising and they can't control it in part due to climate change and you've got Italy electing [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2744.4599999999996s)]
*  He's like far-right Georgia Maloney, you know parties and politicians and we were already like it's funny like this is our age [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2750.9399999999996s)]
*  Right Tommy, but you remember like when we were getting involved in politics, you know leading up to 2008 [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2758.5s)]
*  And then you know, like there would be these [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2763.22s)]
*  2030 predictions it seemed like far away. Well now no like we're here [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2766.1s)]
*  We're at points where in the next couple years like the government's getting elected in places like Italy are gonna be in office [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2770.3799999999997s)]
*  You know up and like we're in the window [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2776.2999999999997s)]
*  So we this is what I mean by like we can't wait for like sometimes people even tell me in the United States like well [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2778.3399999999997s)]
*  The Republicans are beginning to be open to certain types of environmental legislation [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2783.58s)]
*  No, no, like that's where we needed to be like 15 years ago [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2787.18s)]
*  Like we this this can't wait for that anymore and that that means unfortunately [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2790.3s)]
*  It's gonna have to be an effort that is principally happening outside of government [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2795.1800000000003s)]
*  That doesn't mean we shouldn't put all the pressure we can on governments, too [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2799.34s)]
*  But it means that we have to be doing everything. Yeah and a lot of mitigation anyway read mobility [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2802.38s)]
*  It's a great book and maybe think about a lot of stuff differently a couple more things before [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2806.5800000000004s)]
*  The interview so Ben we talked about Tommy Tuberville a few times. He's a former football coach [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2810.86s)]
*  racist asshole a senator from Alabama full-time [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2815.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2818.3999999999996s)]
*  Bud Kilmer, I think is the coach I was thinking of from varsity blues [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2819.64s)]
*  So he's been holding up all US military promotions because he's mad the Pentagon provides support for US service members and their families who need [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2823.04s)]
*  to travel to receive abortion services [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2830.44s)]
*  Separately in 2019 you might recall that President Trump created the US Space Force [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2834.24s)]
*  Initially Space Force was headquartered in Colorado albeit temporarily the Air Force recommended that we keep it there [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2839.3199999999997s)]
*  But in the last days of the Trump administration Trump decided to move Space Force command to Alabama and later said I personally moved it [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2846.96s)]
*  To a red state. He's like taking credit for it [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2854.32s)]
*  President Biden has been reviewing that decision and on Monday announced that no, sorry, Tommy T [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2856.34s)]
*  Space Force is going to remain in Colorado [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2862.32s)]
*  The Pentagon says this is the least disruptive option all the service chiefs support this so Ben [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2865.04s)]
*  I'm not saying that politics had anything to do with this decision because truly how would I know? [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2870.96s)]
*  But Tommy Tuberville is pretty goddamn stupid [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2877.4s)]
*  If you thought that picking a massive destructive fight with the military in the middle of this relocation conversation was gonna help his cause [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2880.48s)]
*  Yeah, Tommy T taking on the entire United States military and fucking with their promotions [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2888.6000000000004s)]
*  Probably not a good way to get the Joint Chiefs of Staff [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2893.1600000000003s)]
*  Review to find in your favor to move the Space Force to Huntsville, Alabama, buddy [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2896.1s)]

*  Two quick dumb things before we go to the interview that have you seen this debate about [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2965.36s)]
*  Whether there is a fake bear at a zoo in China. No, so, okay [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2970.48s)]
*  So there's a bear or a bear like object [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2975.4s)]
*  At a zoo in eastern China [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2978.52s)]
*  There's a video of it standing on its hind legs that went viral because people who saw it were like that is 100% [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2980.0s)]
*  a dude in a bear suit [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2986.56s)]
*  That's the photo. No way [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2988.6800000000003s)]
*  So for people can see it this is a dude in a bear suit like [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2993.1600000000003s)]
*  Like looks like it looks like the suit is like creased up around his butt and it's standing on its hind legs. So [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=2996.6s)]
*  Apparently this it's called a Sun bear. It's native to Southeast Asia. It's relatively small. It's about the size of a big dog [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3004.2400000000002s)]
*  I saw a video of the bear actually then sit down and walk around normally on all fours and all of a sudden like, okay [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3009.76s)]
*  That's that's probably a real bear there [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3016.82s)]
*  The darker version of this is there's some concern that maybe it's being like maltreated and that's why it's standing up and acting weird [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3018.52s)]
*  But this CBS News report on this little mini online scandal said that in 2013 a different zoo in China [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3023.52s)]

*  And then another zoo put a bunch of balloons in a pool and said that they were penguins [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3044.56s)]
*  Like a really [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3051.9199999999996s)]
*  Hilarious story and then finally been Hannah my wife flagged this one for me. There's a meme going around [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3053.52s)]

*  The the global criminal justice ambassador is a good person to know if you're in a pinch [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3395.52s)]

*  If I ever need someone to call it interpol for me [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3404.6s)]
*  So last week it was reported that President Biden ordered the US government to begin sharing evidence of Russian war crimes in Ukraine [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3407.84s)]
*  With the International Criminal Court at the Hague. Can you help us understand what that means in practice? [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3415.32s)]
*  Sure, maybe just a little bit of background [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3421.92s)]
*  So the court received an unprecedented referral by over 40 states of the situation in Ukraine and that enabled the prosecutor to open [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3423.96s)]
*  His investigation immediately [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3432.1600000000003s)]
*  Ukraine has not ratified the Rome statute, which is the treaty that created the court, but it has consented to jurisdiction [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3434.52s)]
*  And so what that means is that anything that happens on the territory of Ukraine falls within ICC jurisdiction? [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3440.48s)]
*  The concern here was that Russia is a non-party state and so would be held responsible [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3448.36s)]
*  potentially and of course [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3454.84s)]
*  We assume that Russian figures will be the primary targets here since most of the allegations in fact [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3455.92s)]
*  The vast majority of allegations have been against Russian actors on the ground both direct perpetrators and then up the chain of command and [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3461.86s)]
*  There were concerns within the Pentagon that if we supported this investigation [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3470.0s)]
*  We would be potentially undermining a long-standing objection to [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3475.1600000000003s)]
*  Sharing and cooperating with the court on matters that involve the nationals of non-state parties [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3479.92s)]
*  So parties that haven't joined the treaty and of course that is how we are situated [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3486.36s)]
*  And we felt some degree of vulnerability when the court had an open investigation in Afghanistan [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3490.56s)]
*  That might have involved a consideration of international forces including our own [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3496.96s)]
*  Personnel for violations that happened on Afghan territory because Afghanistan had ratified the Rome statue [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3501.52s)]
*  You know early after the the Rome statute was finalized [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3508.12s)]
*  So we had reached a policy impasse as to whether or not we should provide concrete assistance [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3511.36s)]
*  To the prosecutor as he proceeded on this investigation. We had expressed support [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3517.52s)]
*  Rhetorically for the investigation but had not yet been in a position to be able to actually share information or otherwise provide [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3523.2s)]
*  Concrete assistance. So now we have the green light from the president who has indicated that it should be the policy of the United States [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3531.16s)]
*  To do this and so now we are in a position to entertain [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3538.44s)]
*  Any requests for assistance that might come from either the prosecutor or the court itself? [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3542.0s)]
*  Then we still make a policy determination as to whether or not we want to provide the assistance that's [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3546.7999999999997s)]
*  Requested and then we have the difficult question of like do we have anything that's actually responsive and in which case we do [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3552.98s)]
*  Then we're in a position to be able to provide that sort of concrete assistance you you raised sort of the interesting [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3558.68s)]
*  Hybrid space the US is in here. So we're not a party to the Rome statue [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3565.44s)]
*  The US doesn't recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3568.74s)]
*  Do you think that that as a general matter hurts US credibility when it comes to prosecuting war crimes? [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3571.0s)]
*  Who's for who's prosecuting war crimes for our? [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3577.4s)]
*  prosecuting them in our own courts or for our support for an institution that we haven't ratified the underlying treaty for I mean [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3580.3199999999997s)]
*  I think upholding the principle of [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3586.6s)]
*  You know holding someone like Vladimir Putin accountable for his actions in Ukraine [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3589.16s)]
*  I mean listen, you'll remember this from your own time in government [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3594.08s)]
*  There are many international institutions that we support but that we don't fully join or subject ourselves to jurisdiction [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3597.6s)]
*  and a great metaphor that I heard from a [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3603.7999999999997s)]
*  Former international law professor was that we're often a buttress on the outside of the institution rather than a pillar [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3606.96s)]
*  Holding up the institution on the inside and that's very much been over the years our sort of posture towards the International Criminal Court [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3614.0s)]
*  It's very difficult for us to ratify treaties. We are uncomfortable subjecting ourselves to [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3621.44s)]
*  Extraterritorial or international jurisdiction and so that's where we have landed politically all that said we have still over the years and this is [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3626.84s)]
*  Really sort of crossed [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3635.08s)]
*  Administrations, this is not just a Obama or a Democratic [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3637.56s)]
*  Party sort of a stance, but we saw this with the Bush administration as well [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3641.2000000000003s)]
*  recognizing that the ICC plays a role in a larger ecosystem of international justice and there are certain certain circumstances where [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3645.56s)]
*  It is appropriate and indeed welcome for the ICC to be operating where there are no other justice options available [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3653.0s)]
*  widespread impunity [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3659.6s)]
*  extremely serious offenses victims being ravaged across a [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3660.88s)]
*  Conflict zone or by an authoritarian regime and the United States should play a leadership role [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3664.84s)]
*  Vis-a-vis those prosecutions even if we haven't at the same time subjected ourselves to the same degree of jurisdiction [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3670.12s)]
*  Yeah, we probably worth pointing out that during the Trump administration [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3675.8s)]
*  I think they at one point we're trying to target the ICC with sanctions [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3678.96s)]
*  After the ICC opened a war crimes investigation presumably to pressure them into stopping indeed [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3684.2s)]
*  That was a nature relationship and in one relationship that has been one that has been you know [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3689.52s)]
*  In flux and is waxed and waned over the years [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3694.88s)]
*  The the Trump administration did sanction two individuals the chief prosecutor herself and one of her key aides [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3697.92s)]
*  one of the first moves that Secretary Blinken did while when taking office was to order a sort of review of US ICC policy and [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3705.16s)]
*  one of the first concrete steps was to immediately take down those sanctions and [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3712.8s)]
*  Announce publicly that they should never have been brought. We also know from a more practical perspective that they were completely [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3717.3999999999996s)]
*  Self-defeating they alienated many of our friends and allies who are members of the court who care deeply about the court [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3724.7599999999998s)]
*  They were extremely upset with us and and made that very well known [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3730.72s)]
*  And also it's not clear that it did anything [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3735.3199999999997s)]
*  Effective here in fact if anything it sort of girded the court against the United States [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3738.52s)]
*  And so in the end they were not only morally wrong, but also really counterproductive [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3742.72s)]
*  Yeah from a strategic perspective. So those came down immediately and a decision was made that in fact we should [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3746.64s)]
*  Re-engage and return to a policy of sort of constructive involvement with respect to the court and any requests that might come in for our assistance [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3753.48s)]
*  Yeah, and let's just know this has been a challenging debate since the Clinton administration with lots of pushback usually from the US military [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3760.92s)]
*  I remember after President Obama was elected during that lame duck not lame duck period during the [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3766.2s)]
*  Transition period George Will a conservative columnist at the Washington Post had invited him to come over for dinner [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3771.7200000000003s)]
*  And we said yes and sort of the spirit of bipartisanship and for some reason they had me staff it [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3778.0s)]
*  I was like 12 years old and I walk in the door and the first question Obama gets is from George Will's like high school [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3782.48s)]
*  Or teenage son about why the US wasn't a party to the Rome Statute in the ICC [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3788.96s)]
*  I was like oh my god [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3794.9s)]
*  If this is what the press corps kids questions are like God help us when we get to the real thing [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3795.68s)]
*  But anyway [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3799.7999999999997s)]
*  so everything about the [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3801.3199999999997s)]
*  Russian conduct in Ukraine has been awful [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3804.2799999999997s)]
*  but one of the stories that I think really that [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3806.6s)]
*  Shook me to my core and a lot of people felt the same way or were these stories about the systematic deportation of Ukrainian children [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3809.68s)]
*  from Ukraine to [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3817.2s)]
*  Territories either occupied by Russia or to Russia proper in many cases [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3819.2s)]
*  They were then put up for adoption despite the fact that they had relatives back home or even parents back home who wanted them [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3822.68s)]
*  Can you talk about what's being done to hold? [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3828.64s)]
*  Officials responsible for what is essentially kidnapping Ukrainian children. Yeah, it's really a horrific element of [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3832.36s)]
*  Vast crime base that we're seeing in Ukraine literally everywhere that Russia's forces have been deployed [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3839.28s)]
*  We have seen patterns of war crimes crimes against humanity and other atrocities against civilians against prisoners of war [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3844.7599999999998s)]
*  Protected first protective items cultural property all of it. There seems to be very few limiting [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3852.12s)]
*  Norms here and it's I think it's a combination of orders everything on down to just very undisciplined troops [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3859.2s)]
*  But this we know is a very organized system. And in fact the conflict observatory, which was funded by the [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3865.68s)]
*  The United States State Department has done some research demonstrating that some of the filtration operation [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3873.08s)]
*  System that infrastructure was actually put in place before February 24th 2022 [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3879.56s)]
*  So there was already a plan to do filtration and the children have been a component of that [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3885.0s)]
*  Ukrainian prosecutor general has estimated that about 19,000 children have been subjected to this [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3890.8s)]
*  Abduction and it's an interesting combination of children being literally abducted from Ukraine and taken to Russia [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3897.0s)]
*  Versus children who have been invited to summer camps, but then retained there their phones [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3903.1200000000003s)]
*  Taken away from them not able to be in touch with their loved ones or their guardians whole [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3909.72s)]
*  institutions that have been emptied of children orphanages, etc, and then we also know that in Russia there are systems of [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3914.2799999999997s)]
*  Foster care and even adoptions and there have been websites that have gone up and then they've been taken down once [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3921.12s)]
*  I think they realized that was maybe not a great idea to be advertising this [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3926.08s)]
*  That they were putting these children up for adoptions [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3931.3199999999997s)]
*  So what to do about this we are funding within the State Department a whole range of civil society actors [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3934.0s)]
*  They're trying to engage in tracing and the return of children in a quiet sort of humanitarian way [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3939.94s)]
*  That being of course the first priority is to get those kids back to their loved ones and there are [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3946.0s)]
*  Passageways that have been used and I think upwards of about 500 kids have been now brought back [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3951.1600000000003s)]
*  Some parents are taking matters into their own hand and it's often women and grandmothers [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3957.6s)]
*  Because men are not able to leave Ukraine and so women and grandmothers are having to cross [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3962.16s)]
*  international borders [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3967.96s)]
*  Into occupation territory and even into Russia to try and retrieve their children [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3970.0s)]
*  But then this has been the subject of the first set of arrest warrants that have been issued by the International Criminal Court [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3973.96s)]
*  So both President Putin himself and his children's rights commissioner Maria Lavrova below the have now been essentially indicted [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3980.12s)]
*  For the war crime of the forcible transfer and deportation of the civilian population in particular of children [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3988.2799999999997s)]
*  So it's really a strong focus of the ICC [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3995.3599999999997s)]
*  We also know that all the other pathways to justice that exists so cases in Ukrainian courts cases in third state courts [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=3998.7999999999997s)]
*  For example in Europe. They're all very focused on this because it is so horrific [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4005.96s)]
*  It's such a clear violation of international law and we have words [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4010.3199999999997s)]
*  Literally coming out of the mouths of potential defendants [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4014.52s)]
*  Extolling this wonderful humanitarian gesture that Russia is engaged in [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4018.12s)]
*  So it's actually quite an easy case to a certain degree because we have statements against interest by the very individuals who are implementing this [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4022.4s)]
*  Horrific policy. Yeah, I mean if listeners want to learn more about this Vice News a really great reporter named Isabel Young [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4030.72s)]
*  Did sort of a documentary like like 25 minute length piece on [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4037.2s)]
*  One of these camps where these kids have been taking and they actually allowed her in and they let her start to interview these kids [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4041.8s)]
*  When the kids said the wrong things Russian minders would dart forward and silence them and eventually kicked her out [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4047.2s)]
*  I mean, it's just it's shocking that they think they the Russian officials think they can kind of I don't know [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4052.68s)]
*  Propaganda or spin their way out of what they're doing [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4057.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean they're presenting this as a quote-unquote humanitarian gesture, but there's so much wrong about this [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4060.48s)]
*  I mean if they are in fact the rescuers of these children, they would not be holding them essentially in communicator [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4065.22s)]
*  They would not be taking their phones. They would not be taking them sometimes thousands of miles away from Ukraine [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4071.06s)]
*  They would be returning them as soon as it's possible [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4076.02s)]
*  They would have a tracing system or that would be keeping track of these children [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4078.02s)]
*  None of this policies in place and more fundamentally if these kids were in fact in any risk [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4081.58s)]
*  It was precisely because of the invasion of Russia in the first place [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4087.58s)]
*  So you can't create the problem and then offer the solution by virtue of abducting these children [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4090.54s)]
*  Yeah, I would ask you about you know, how? [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4095.5s)]
*  Technology has changed the way people like you do your job. I mean in previous instances of genocides or you know war crimes [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4098.5s)]
*  You know, you're trying to find like scarce access to satellite technology [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4107.22s)]
*  For example to take pictures of mass graves to use that as evidence now [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4110.94s)]
*  You know the war in Ukraine and many other wars are kind of playing out on social media in these unprecedented ways [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4115.26s)]
*  Can you talk about how? [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4120.9800000000005s)]
*  Folks like you the ICC are using social media to help document and ultimately prosecute these crimes [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4123.54s)]
*  Yeah, indeed [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4128.42s)]
*  It's it's really the the prevalence of digital media and social media has revolutionized the system of international justice [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4129.14s)]
*  I started my career after law school at the Yugoslavia War Crimes Tribunal and we did have some satellite imagery [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4135.62s)]
*  In fact, much of it came from the United States very helpfully in order to show, you know [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4142.3s)]
*  The movement of people or mass graves or the movement of troops, etc [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4146.38s)]
*  But that was kind of all we had now ordinary Ukrainians are documentarians. They have their phone [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4150.02s)]
*  There's CCTV and many of these towns that is recording events in real time as it's happening [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4155.62s)]
*  All of this can be made available to investigators and prosecutors [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4161.12s)]
*  So in some respects we actually paradoxically have an opposite problem where there's almost too much information [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4164.7s)]
*  Ukraine is probably now the most documented crime base in human history [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4170.7s)]
*  I used to say that about Syria, but Ukraine war is now going on so long and there's been such penetration of [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4173.820000000001s)]
*  digital tools of cell phones and smartphones within Ukraine plus all of the other [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4180.14s)]
*  Imagery there's private drones that have been given to the the prosecutor general to be able to collect war crimes [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4185.18s)]
*  You just announced on your last pod that the USAID was sending some Skydio drones [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4191.26s)]
*  We just met with Skydio this week to learn more about how those that technology can be deployed to assist in the in the accountability [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4196.38s)]
*  Space so there's lots of digital imagery [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4203.02s)]
*  The conflict observatory was stood up precisely to scrape social media sites and do so quickly before [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4206.46s)]
*  individuals who post for example trophy videos or even videos that have geolocation codes within their metadata [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4213.62s)]
*  Realize oops, I just put you know, very valuable evidence online [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4219.9400000000005s)]
*  Scrape all of that [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4224.66s)]
*  Aggregated subjected to analysis and then produce a very refined report out of it [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4226.179999999999s)]
*  And so another place if your listeners are interested is the conflict observatory [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4230.78s)]
*  It's it's based out of Yale number of different implementing partners are involved [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4234.74s)]
*  They've put out a number of reports drawing upon what they can see from combining satellite imagery with social media [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4238.5s)]
*  Collections and have been able to identify a lot of patterns in terms of attacking cultural property the abduction of children the filtration [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4246.98s)]
*  System attacking grain energy energy infrastructure all of this will be incredibly valuable to war crimes prosecutors and investigators around the world [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4254.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4262.299999999999s)]
*  I remember reading some stories over the past years about social media platforms taking down some of these videos [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4262.74s)]
*  Presumably because you know, they're gruesome they violate certain terms of service. Is that in you know investigators saying [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4268.379999999999s)]
*  They're taking away evidence. They're stymie. I work. Is that something that's been worked out with some of these platforms? Indeed [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4276.379999999999s)]
*  It is definitely an open issue and they're actually I have to be cautious here what I can say [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4281.42s)]
*  Because there was a lawsuit by a state against the Biden administration for [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4287.9400000000005s)]
*  Intervening in content moderation [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4294.18s)]
*  Questions and determinations that social media platforms are making that has been stayed [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4296.5s)]
*  So technically we're not under an injunction to talk about this but a very interesting question [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4300.74s)]
*  It was had nothing to do with the war crimes space [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4305.38s)]
*  It was mostly sort of anti-vaxxers etc and encouragement to remove some of that because of the public health concerns [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4307.9s)]
*  Nonetheless, there's no question that there have been issues with social media [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4315.179999999999s)]
*  platforms reviewing their terms of service etc and realizing that some of this imagery is [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4319.62s)]
*  Violent or potentially shows criminal conduct and so they would take it down [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4325.38s)]
*  There have been now efforts afoot Berkeley Human Rights Center in the lead here to encourage social media companies to create evidentiary [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4329.46s)]
*  Vaults and just put that stuff there and save it [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4337.0599999999995s)]
*  They don't have to have it available [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4340.42s)]
*  But don't delete it permanently such that if they do get a request from a prosecutorial authority [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4342.0199999999995s)]
*  Whether by way of a subpoena or a voluntary request for assistance [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4347.62s)]
*  They haven't they can make the policy decision as to whether or not they can share that or they can respond [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4352.219999999999s)]
*  Legally if order to do so and have that information available. It is critical [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4357.42s)]
*  Fortunately, there are a number of outfits out there like Bellingcat and others that are constantly searching for this stuff themselves and are able to preserve it under their own [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4362.099999999999s)]
*  Preservation protocols to then make it more available in the event that it does in fact show criminal conduct and the case is moving forward [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4371.66s)]
*  somewhere the ability of organizations like Bellingcat and other [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4377.98s)]
*  You know non governmental open source intelligence firms to not only preserve this stuff [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4381.54s)]
*  But geo locate images based on shadows and you know, some I don't know building in the background is just astounding to me [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4387.3s)]
*  It's truly I don't understand that they do what they do [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4394.5s)]
*  It's incredible, isn't it? [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4396.22s)]
*  And they have these scores of students working in law schools and universities around the country doing these sort of open source evaluations [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4397.9800000000005s)]
*  Where they're being taught these techniques and then they're able to take an image [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4404.900000000001s)]
*  Harvest the metadata confirm that it hasn't been tampered with it's not some sort of a deep fake etc [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4408.9400000000005s)]
*  That you know if there's watermarks, etc [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4414.54s)]
*  You know what who added those except all of that and then be able to verify the the content [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4416.46s)]
*  We're also seeing this ability to do what's called hashing which is as soon as a digital image is created [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4421.9400000000005s)]
*  It's given a unique hash and if it's ever been tampered with the hash number will essentially change [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4427.74s)]
*  It's like a fingerprint essentially [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4433.22s)]
*  And so that has been able to assure courts that in fact the image is what it purports to be that there's authenticity to it [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4434.900000000001s)]
*  And all of that metadata that geo locates [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4442.1s)]
*  Etc a time date stamp all of that is accurate to when that photograph was taken [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4444.660000000001s)]
*  We've seen a number of cases in Europe particularly arising out of this the Syrian conflict in which courts are being [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4449.22s)]
*  presented with this evidence and they're frankly being quite sophisticated about how they're evaluating it and then ultimately accepting it into evidence so [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4455.860000000001s)]
*  Trophy videos etc that that defendants have posted those have all been used against them in order to find their responsibility [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4462.820000000001s)]
*  For committing war crimes and other atrocities [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4468.660000000001s)]
*  Well, it's fascinating [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4470.66s)]
*  Final question for you and thank you again for your time [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4472.3s)]
*  I mean, what do you say to people who might feel like or question whether it's worth the time and effort [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4474.94s)]
*  To build these cases because in the past, you know prosecutions can be very slow. You've mentioned Syria a couple times [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4480.82s)]
*  You know Assad is essentially being welcomed back into the fold by a lot of his neighbors and they feel like you know [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4487.0599999999995s)]
*  The odds of someone like Vladimir Putin getting turned over to the Hague for prosecution seems very low [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4492.78s)]
*  Maybe we should focus on you know, some other element of the war planning. What would you say to those folks? [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4498.16s)]
*  I mean I see my job in this role as working to strengthen the system of international justice [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4503.0s)]
*  So that on the one hand it it is able to exert a stronger deterrent effect [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4509.56s)]
*  So that future perpetrators maybe not megalomaniacs like President Putin himself [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4514.56s)]
*  But those in his inner circle who maybe don't want to go down with a sinking ship [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4519.24s)]
*  Will think twice before they will be willing to pass along orders, etc [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4523.16s)]
*  We've seen massive [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4527.16s)]
*  Defections from some of these authoritarian regimes where individuals have done their own private calculus and they thought I you know want to leave [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4528.6s)]
*  I don't want to be a part of this and risk [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4535.64s)]
*  Spending the rest of my life in jail or being hunted as a fugitive around the world and we know that the long arm of justice [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4537.84s)]
*  Is patient and so we have seen even decades later [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4544.04s)]
*  Individuals being finally brought to justice and each one of these cases is [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4548.56s)]
*  Strengthening the larger system and then that system will be stronger and better and more able to work the Syria conflict [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4552.96s)]
*  And the one hand is and I wrote my PhD on this on the one hand is a sad story, right? [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4560.0s)]
*  We haven't seen a global response the ICC referral ship failed because Russia was able to veto it in the Security Council [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4565.92s)]
*  No ad hoc international tribunal was created on the other hand [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4573.04s)]
*  There are these incredible [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4576.64s)]
*  Efforts at justice in Europe where the war crimes units within prosecutorial authorities are gearing up and they're taking on the obligation and the responsibility [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4578.240000000001s)]
*  To do these cases in national courts and for each one of these cases [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4586.200000000001s)]
*  It gives victims hope it lets them know that they haven't been forgotten and they can live even if it's not their case per se [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4590.76s)]
*  You talk to these survivor groups and they are living vicariously through these cases [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4598.64s)]
*  So even a single case against a gazette in Germany that recently found that the perpetrator of an ISIS member had committed genocide [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4603.12s)]
*  That has broad reverberations within survivor communities [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4612.12s)]
*  We've now seen the UK making a genocide determination vis-a-vis ISIS all of this is because [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4615.74s)]
*  These cases are moving forward and we're strengthening the whole ecosystem [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4621.36s)]
*  National courts regional courts hybrid courts and international courts and my goal is to make sure that the United States is a strong partner [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4625.04s)]
*  An ally and a source of assistance whether it's financial information sharing or diplomatic support [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4632.8s)]
*  Well ambassador von shock. Thank you for the work you're doing. Thanks for joining the show [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4638.56s)]
*  Truly appreciate it and then best of luck to you because this is a very important stuff with as you point out. I think [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4642.68s)]
*  It may pay off over the course of decades [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4648.96s)]
*  But what it does someone like Omar Barshear gets gets arrested it's pretty meaningful to a lot of people. So thanks indeed [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4651.76s)]
*  We're all playing a long game here. Thanks so much for having me on the show. I really appreciate it was a lot of fun [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4658.320000000001s)]
*  Thanks again to ambassador van shock for joining the show [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4661.64s)]
*  I bet she's never been on any program following cat. I farted. I've hope discussion. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's what we do here [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4664.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of how we very you know, we varied up. It's a nice combo of smart and stupid [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4672.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's what we're here to do doing our best someone's gotta do it. All right, let's go read some indictment is yeah [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4679.6s)]
*  Let's check it out [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4685.240000000001s)]
*  You [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIbEzB498KU&t=4691.6s)]
