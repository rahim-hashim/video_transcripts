Video Description: Tommy Vietor and Ben Rhodes discuss Trump’s inauguration, the tech oligarchy that was on display, foreign leaders in attendance, some of the most damaging and far-reaching executive orders from pulling out of the Paris Climate agreement to designating Mexican cartels terrorist organizations, and nomination updates on Tulsi Gabbard and Pete Hegseth. They also talk about the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas and the debate over who gets credit for it in Washington DC, the continued agony of uncertainty for Israeli hostage families and civilians in Gaza, the failed TikTok ban, the arrest of South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol, and a story of cancel culture coming after one man’s enhancements in Italy.

# Trump Says He's a Peacemaker While Spewing Fascist Rhetoric at Inauguration
**Pod Save the World:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs)
*  Welcome back to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Ben Rhodes [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=0.0s)]
*  Shit is bleak Ben [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4.38s)]
*  Really bleak. Normally I love doing this show because we get to turn off [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=6.42s)]
*  American politics for a while and use different parts of our brain and talk about new things [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=10.8s)]
*  But it's been very hard to focus on kind of anything but yesterday for me today. I don't know about you. Yeah, no my [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=14.24s)]
*  Let's just say my partially dry January did not hold through yesterday [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=20.46s)]
*  I'm a little worse for wear just 20 days [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  Something about the the imagery of yesterday led me directly to vodka [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=29.259999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, which felt like the right choice. Were you California dry? Which like it's like mushrooms [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=34.94s)]
*  I'm not dry at all now. Yeah, that was dark yesterday. That was bleak. I have to say it was dark [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=44.06s)]
*  Also, it was endless like we'll get into it. Yeah, I did his inaugural. He was like seven speeches yesterday [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=48.379999999999995s)]
*  It's like buddy you're exhausting us on day one and I know that's the plan. That's the plan. Yeah, that's the plan [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=53.36s)]
*  Well, as you can tell today, we're gonna cover the inauguration [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=59.02s)]
*  We're gonna cover what it means to put on display the new American oligarchy and just show the world all our donors as well as our [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=61.5s)]
*  Tech leaders on the dais. We'll talk about some of the foreign policy elements of Trump's speech [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=69.62s)]
*  We'll tackle a few of the flurry of executive orders that Trump signed yesterday and what they mean for climate change immigration policy [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=74.54s)]
*  Counterterrorism and more and then we will briefly check in on some of Trump's nominees for senior positions in national security [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=82.58s)]
*  We'll talk about the ceasefire in Gaza how it came to be who gets the credit and what comes next [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=90.06s)]
*  this tick-tock ban disaster and then the rolling madness in South Korea and then [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=96.97999999999999s)]
*  Ben you did our interview today. Who'd you talk to? Yeah, I talked to Sam Rose [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=103.19999999999999s)]
*  Who's the acting director of UNRWA in Gaza? So I think we've had a lot thanks to Alona and Michael. We've had a lot of good [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  clips from people there, but I [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=115.08s)]
*  Think this is the first time I was able to interview someone at length [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=117.84s)]
*  so please I know we always say this but everybody should listen to this interview to just get a sense of [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=122.0s)]
*  What it's like in Gaza what the mood is what the scale of destruction is what the humanitarian effort is focused on now and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=127.0s)]
*  The absolute cruel insanity of the fact that Israel has passed a law that is going to ban UNRWA [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=135.4s)]
*  ban any Israeli interaction with UNRWA which would essentially make it impossible for them to do their work because they obviously work at checkpoints and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=142.16s)]
*  International aid workers won't be able to leave and come back under this law. So [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  in in dark times I have to say [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=155.24s)]
*  If you're sad about Trump just listen to Sam Rose and think about [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=158.0s)]
*  What it's like to be in Gaza right now, so people should definitely listen to that interview [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=162.48s)]
*  Well, that's a hell of a plug. Yeah, you want to be emotionally gutted twice now. It's important [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=165.88s)]
*  Well, honestly, like I the positive of it is, you know, I didn't get to tell the guy exactly [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=169.88s)]
*  But I mean people like this give you some hope right? I mean, yeah [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=174.88s)]
*  He said he's been going in and out of Gaza for like almost 20 or 20 years [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=178.52s)]
*  I think and there are good people out there [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=183.52s)]
*  And there are good people out there trying to help other people and and that there's hope in that let's just say that there is yeah [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=185.92s)]
*  But do you know are I'm seeing a lot more images of just how flattened Gaza is [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=193.28s)]
*  You know, there were images of northern Gaza that were coming out yesterday that we basically like every structure is down [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=198.27999999999997s)]
*  There were a lot of images of Rafa where we kept hearing that the Israeli military invasion had been partially stopped [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=203.04s)]
*  But it sure doesn't look like it given the aftermath by the extraordinary diplomacy of the Biden administration [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=210.27999999999997s)]
*  They really stopped that invasion that just left the place looking like Hiroshima, you know [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=214.88s)]
*  But yeah, but do you know I mean our foreign journalists getting in yet? Do we know I've not seen foreign journalists get in yet [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=218.68s)]
*  So we'll see I mean, I there are different phases of this ceasefire. I mean Sam was saying that the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=224.28s)]
*  You know, there's still [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=229.92s)]
*  You're still not able to go from southern Gaza to northern Gaza. So there's still a lot of restrictions on movement at this phase [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=231.51999999999998s)]
*  So we'll see got it. Got it [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=237.84s)]
*  Well, we will get to that and we'll talk about the the phases of the ceasefire in depth [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=239.96s)]
*  But let's start with Trump's inauguration. So [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=243.52s)]
*  The events themselves were moved inside [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=246.28s)]
*  Because it is freezing cold in Washington DC and then as much as I would love to make fun of Trump for being a beta wimp [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=248.56s)]
*  And point out how cold Obama's inauguration was in 2009 [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=254.56s)]
*  I'm currently in New York and I just walked here to the studio and I can confirm that it's brutally cold outside [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=258.04s)]
*  So changing locations probably a good idea, but the moving the events indoors meant a shrunken stage in dais and [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=263.04s)]
*  Despite all of that Trump still surrounded himself with this, you know, coterie of American tech oligarchs [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=272.32s)]
*  I'd say starting with credit where credit is due Elon Musk bought his chair on that stage [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=279.12s)]
*  He put fifty two hundred fifty million dollars into the Trump campaign [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=283.96s)]
*  And now is the sprawling kind of White House portfolio doing God knows what but oh, by the way, then did you see that? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=287.6s)]
*  The vague Rama Swami already got fired from [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=292.72s)]
*  Well, yeah since his kind of bizarre [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=297.84s)]
*  Tweet about or about screech about a horrible about what was it Steve? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=300.88s)]
*  I'm on the bill saved by the bell. Yeah screech. Yeah. Yeah, we got a laugh where we can. Yeah [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=306.2s)]
*  We do so they expire from Doge Elon still running it but like aside from Elon, right? He was like in the club [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=310.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean on that stage were met as Mark Zuckerberg Google Sundar Pichai Amazon's Jeff Bezos [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=316.88s)]
*  Open AI Sam Altman tick tock CEO shout you so the all these guys are sitting next to the incoming [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=322.88s)]
*  By the way, the tick tock CEO sitting next to the incoming director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=330.48s)]
*  Which I guess shout out to her somebody had a sense of humor in the seating chart there [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=334.86s)]
*  She had a real hands-on approach to intelligence collection. Yeah, like we'll get into that tick tock stuff later [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=339.08s)]
*  But I just you know, I also spotted Miriam Adelson who's a huge Trump donor Sheldon Adelson's [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=343.74s)]
*  Wife he's passed away, but she is reportedly wants Trump to annex the West Bank [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=349.08s)]
*  That's sort of like the yeah, that's what she tried to buy [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=354.6s)]
*  For yeah what she wants to buy as annexation [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=357.08000000000004s)]
*  So I just want to get your takeaway Ben from from seeing this new American oligarchy on display at the inauguration [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=359.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean again a lot of the tech CEOs were there because they had to bend the knee to Trump and I think he was [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=367.56s)]
*  Showing the world like look watch look at all these supplicants kind of bow down to me [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=372.76s)]
*  But it did strike me that like the message that sends to the world is the United States [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=377.36s)]
*  Mixing business and donor money in a way that just was completely new [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=382.53999999999996s)]
*  I mean our our political system is disgusting and full of money and it's terrible but the optics of having like [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=387.9s)]
*  Donors ahead of the cabinet. It's pretty pretty on the nose [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=393.78s)]
*  Yeah, it kind of felt like a straight line from the Citizens United decision to that tableau [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=397.65999999999997s)]
*  So the decision by the Supreme Court to allow [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=404.85999999999996s)]
*  Unlimited money and dark money in American politics kind of leads to this oligarchy quite directly [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=408.78s)]
*  So there's no way of fixing it without fixing money in politics, which isn't happening anytime soon [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=413.65999999999997s)]
*  I guess my reaction apart from just being totally disgusted by those people because they don't look if you want to be sympathetic [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=418.41999999999996s)]
*  Okay, maybe you know you feel like you need to play ball a little bit with Trump to stop him from destroying your company [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=427.3s)]
*  But you actually don't need to sit up there like that [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=433.34s)]
*  No, I mean I didn't you know [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=435.82s)]
*  like you don't as he's running down America and giving this kind of dark apocalyptic speech and [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=438.82s)]
*  Anointing himself as chosen by God to save America like you don't need to sit there [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=447.14000000000004s)]
*  And I think what I we've talked a bunch about oligarchs on this show [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=451.14000000000004s)]
*  Like obviously Russian oligarchs and Hungarian oligarchs and Indian oligarchs [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=456.18s)]
*  It's not a new idea that there are people that are powerful and [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=460.78000000000003s)]
*  Politically connected and own media enterprises and have deep reach and life and you know of the people in a country [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=466.42s)]
*  I think what's different though Tommy is that we're the United States and so our oligarchs are [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=473.86s)]
*  Mega powerful globally, you know, so it's not you know [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=480.02s)]
*  Victor Urbán has a buddy who was one of his childhood friends and I think this guy was like a plumber and [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=484.3s)]
*  Now he's like a billionaire [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=490.54s)]
*  And and and so, you know, and then you find this fine that guy doesn't control technology companies that influence life [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=492.58s)]
*  Everywhere on earth. And so I think what makes this kind of extra [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=500.18s)]
*  scary is that [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=504.42s)]
*  you know meta is the [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=506.65999999999997s)]
*  leading experience of the internet and communications for [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=510.14s)]
*  Hundreds of millions if not billions of people around the world, you know Sam Altman is [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=514.86s)]
*  and and and and Google are developing [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=519.86s)]
*  Artificial intelligence that as is it as meta? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they change the world that could transform life on earth [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=523.22s)]
*  You know, and so I think what is so unsettling about it is [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=530.1400000000001s)]
*  Sure, it's kind of conventional oligarchy a la Putin's Russia [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=534.5400000000001s)]
*  but the the the stakes are just so much higher because it's the United States and there's so much power in these companies and [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=538.86s)]
*  And they're they're their personal interest [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=546.2600000000001s)]
*  Are clearly, you know now entangled with Trump's in ways that are deeply worrying [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=550.3000000000001s)]
*  and I guess the last thing I'd say by way of introduction is [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=555.94s)]
*  these guys are really showing who they are because [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=559.1800000000001s)]
*  You know, they these are the kind of guys some of them at least [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=561.82s)]
*  Who turn up at like climate change summits, you know, or like talk about sustainability [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=565.6600000000001s)]
*  This guy pulled out of the fucking Paris agreement yesterday [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=570.3000000000001s)]
*  like why as you were bending the knee and slobbering on him and you know, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=573.22s)]
*  You know grinning goofily [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=578.1600000000001s)]
*  In the kind of row of oligarchs this guy's doing something, you know [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=580.2800000000001s)]
*  The my point is that these are earning the January 6th rioters. These people said were [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=585.1600000000001s)]
*  Deplorable. Yeah, these people clearly don't care about anything except themselves and and I know that's an obvious point, but it's just worth reinforcing [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=589.6800000000001s)]
*  Never again believe anything any one of those people says and even if they give some money way they have unlimited money [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=596.5200000000001s)]
*  It's not it's a fucking drop in the ocean to them and and so they've just shown who they are forever [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=603.04s)]
*  now we now know who these people are and [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=609.08s)]
*  It's it's our challenge to make it clear that this is the actual establishment in the world [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=612.4s)]
*  The establishment isn't podcasters and climate scientists as much as right-wing influencers would know [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=618.84s)]
*  Yeah, the elites are the the richest people on the planet. Yeah, those are the fucking elites right there. That's the elites [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=624.16s)]
*  I did Ben, you know [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=629.96s)]
*  It was sometimes when you you buy a ticket on like stub hub at the last minute to Fenway Park or like Shea Stadium [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=631.12s)]
*  Yeah, there are seats with obstructed views like you're behind like a huge concrete pillar. That was basically where they put Mike Pence [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=636.28s)]
*  So I did find kind of funny like Joe Joe Rogan had a better seat in the rotunda it seemed [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=644.28s)]
*  But also but you know Trump invited lots of heads of state to attend the inauguration. He invited Chinese President Xi Jinping [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=648.72s)]
*  Vladimir Zelensky the Ukrainian president [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=656.52s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu the Prime Minister of Israel they didn't come which is normal [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=659.52s)]
*  But he did get the kind of conservative rogues gallery of right-wing populace [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=664.12s)]
*  I think we spotted Italian Prime Minister Giorgio Maloney was there [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=668.1s)]
*  Argentinian President Javier Millet for some reason former British Prime Minister Liz Trust and the Tory former Home Secretary [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=673.0s)]
*  Swell of Breiberman showed up. I don't know why Liz Trust comes to all these events like who wants to see Liz Trusts? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=680.28s)]
*  It's the least exciting person I could imagine well and I saw like Swell of Breiberman [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=685.7199999999999s)]
*  posting [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=690.56s)]
*  Selfies of herself in the freezing cold in DC like what is she there to do? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=691.52s)]
*  Like she doesn't run anything like this this kind of [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=696.04s)]
*  right-wing, you know lunatic fringe of people [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=700.52s)]
*  That just kind of want to bask in the glow of Trump, but this is a person with no standing like really [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=704.7199999999999s)]
*  So, yeah, we got treated all those people I'm glad that they had a fun day good for them [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=711.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I hope they wore long underwear. Yeah, um Trump himself. He gave like three different speeches [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=716.0s)]
*  There was the official inaugural speech [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=720.32s)]
*  There was the MAGA red meat that he did right after to the overflow room at the Capitol which was even longer and crazier [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=722.24s)]
*  They talked about like Pelosi wanting January 6 to happen [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=727.9200000000001s)]
*  Then he went to the Capitol one arena for this big rally with supporters [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=730.88s)]
*  Who are supposed to go to the parade that was canceled because it was too cold [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=734.88s)]
*  Then he did like a 45-minute executive order signing in the Oval Office that was also part press conference [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=738.0s)]
*  And it was just this classic like Steve Bannon [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=745.4799999999999s)]
*  Flood the zone with shit day, but Ben, you know [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=748.4399999999999s)]

*  Trump invited a bunch of these Israeli hostage families onto the stage and then he went on a rant with them [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=753.7199999999999s)]
*  Just standing there about the j6 hostages is what he was calling them the January 6 insurrectionists who are being held in prison until [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=759.16s)]
*  Last night and then he did all these tributes to his own family [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=765.1999999999999s)]
*  Which is just very weird thing to do in front of these people who are like desperately trying to get loved ones home [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=768.5s)]

*  We are going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=997.36s)]
*  And we will restore the name [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1003.76s)]
*  Of a great president [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1007.72s)]
*  William McKinley to Mount McKinley where it should be and where it belongs [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1010.12s)]
*  President McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1024.04s)]
*  He was a natural businessman and gave Teddy Roosevelt the money for many of the great things he did including the Panama Canal [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1030.4s)]
*  We have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made and [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1038.56s)]
*  Panama's promise to us has been broken and above all China is [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1044.48s)]
*  Operating the Panama Canal and we didn't give it to China. We gave it to Panama and we're taking it back [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1049.52s)]

*  Speeches yesterday or the rhetoric generally first of all the rhetoric what scared me about the rhetoric right is there's this kind of normal dark [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1072.0s)]
*  apocalyptic stuff right up top and [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1079.0800000000002s)]
*  then he has this point where he talks about getting shot and and [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1082.3200000000002s)]
*  You know the bullet ripping through his ear and then he says [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1087.5200000000002s)]
*  He basically says something like you know God [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1092.0s)]
*  Saved me I think to so that I could make America great again or something and and with Trump you're always you know [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1095.72s)]
*  It will go back and forth [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1101.8s)]
*  Maybe this is all just like he's a show with right-wing politics so that he can like get Trump rich [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1103.3999999999999s)]
*  You know on his corruption and on his Trump Memcoin and things like that [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1109.2s)]
*  But then every now and then you hold open the possibility that that he is, you know [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1113.2s)]
*  That he is you know what he sounds like which is a straight-up scary right-wing [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1119.0s)]
*  That if you read that [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1126.24s)]
*  20 years ago, you'd be like, oh, there's a fascist running the United States, you know and and and and so that scared me [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1128.8s)]
*  You know, who knows maybe that's just him being Trump and and you know, I don't want to over crank it [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1138.24s)]
*  No, I mean your rights have mentioned it because there's a lot of this in convention speech, too [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1143.92s)]
*  I mean this kind of divine intervention. He's a gift from the Lord to save us [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1147.96s)]
*  It's a thing that I think kind of emerged from [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1152.8s)]
*  the kind of evangelical [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1155.4s)]
*  Nationalist fringe of the party that he is appropriated [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1158.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and it's just never good for someone to think that about themselves whoever they are [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1161.16s)]
*  On the other stuff, I mean first of all [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1167.0s)]
*  Like you know it had the state of the Union feel because you know all these members of Congress in a closed space [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1169.8s)]
*  The cheers for the Gulf of America what a bunch of children, you know, I mean, it's just stupid [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1174.8s)]
*  It reminded me of Tommy like do you remember that in meetings? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1179.96s)]
*  There are always some people in the Pentagon that insisted on calling the Persian Gulf the Arabian Gulf [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1183.3200000000002s)]
*  Like no, yeah [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1189.3200000000002s)]
*  Because it was like fuck the Iranians or something [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1191.4s)]
*  Oh, we can't call it so there's a history of some of this stuff [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1194.0s)]
*  But I have to say what jumped out to me about the Panama section is it's a big deal [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1197.0800000000002s)]
*  Usually to put something in inaugural dress [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1202.32s)]
*  I've worked on inaugural dresses like you expect every word to be scrutinized now with Trump [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1205.1599999999999s)]
*  You never know if he is what he's signaling [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1210.0s)]
*  But I mean there was a lot of real estate in that speech for the fucking Panama Canal [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1213.52s)]
*  Interestingly Greenland didn't make an appearance. I don't know if the day [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1217.4399999999998s)]
*  I know what got him or something, but it seemed kind of scary and because he later in the speech [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1220.1599999999999s)]
*  He talks about [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1226.0s)]
*  Expansion territorial expansion like at the end he was he was doing a litany of things [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1227.9199999999998s)]
*  He's gonna do to make America great and one was expanding our territory [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1232.72s)]
*  That's not something we've heard and this William McKinley reference [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1237.1999999999998s)]
*  First of all, if there is an afterlife [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1242.04s)]
*  William McKinley must be quite confused right now about the comeback of his own in a moment in a moment [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1244.32s)]
*  But what William McKinley was there at the dawn of American imperialism, right? [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1250.1599999999999s)]
*  So this is you know Spanish American war stuff America claiming territories and they seem to have been reading up on William McKinley and [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1254.3999999999999s)]
*  That's what that's about. I mean, it's not his business acumen [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1262.96s)]
*  It's this guy enlarged the United States through overseas territories. And so I just think whether it's Panama or Greenland [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1266.04s)]
*  I think this is a part of the agenda. I just have no idea, you know, is he gonna [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1273.0s)]
*  Put terrorists on Panama Panama is not gonna give up the canal [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1278.48s)]
*  So I I just don't quite understand what the policy is, but but I think again we should take it seriously [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1282.0s)]
*  Yeah, and it's funny they they seem to seize on a president early on in his administration [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1289.2s)]
*  The first term remember is Andrew Jackson. They were constantly talking about Jackson [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1294.2s)]
*  He had a portrait of Andrew Jackson up and people are kind of like hey man [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1297.68s)]
*  Have you googled the Trail of Tears and some of the darker parts of his history? But yeah, they don't care [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1300.14s)]
*  It's almost like a troll it is [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1304.86s)]
*  Like I mean do we think that Donald Trump like knew much about William McKinley like a few years ago like [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1307.6599999999999s)]
*  Someone clearly is like, you know pitched him on this idea that he's the modern-day McKinley. I guess you know, hey, whatever it takes [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1314.24s)]
*  Yeah, so he did all those speeches did that press conference did all those EOs [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1321.1s)]
*  And then the New York Times blog a reporter named Sean McCree [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1324.6599999999999s)]
*  Posted that doing after all that he said quote president Trump is now waving a military sword around in the air while dancing to the village [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1327.6s)]
*  Still an hour to go [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1334.14s)]
*  We got the full experience yesterday. We got the food yesterday. It was quite a day, but let's get to the substance [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1336.14s)]
*  So Trump signed like 200 EOs yesterday [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1340.52s)]
*  We're not gonna go through all these executive orders views that would take all day [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1343.02s)]
*  But here's a few of the most relevant ones for us [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1345.94s)]
*  Trump pulled us out of the Paris Climate Accords and the World Health Organization [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1349.42s)]
*  Ben I don't know if you watched this kind of 45-minute Oval Office signing event slash press conference [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1353.18s)]
*  But after he got handed the World Health Organization [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1359.02s)]
*  Executive order to sign he goes. Whoo, that's a big one. He was like excited about it. It was very funny [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1361.74s)]
*  He did a bunch of immigration executive orders [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1366.06s)]
*  The impact of those was felt immediately. There's this unbelievably sad Washington Post story today about a Cuban family that had escaped Cuba [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1368.7s)]
*  I think they went through Nicaragua to get to Mexico City [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1377.42s)]
*  They waited Mexico City for six months where they applied for an asylum meeting through the CBP one app [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1380.06s)]
*  Which is the the app you could download to try to you know [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1386.3s)]
*  Do the right thing and follow the rules to get into the US asylum process [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1389.22s)]
*  And then their their appointment which was supposed to happen like the first day of the Trump administration just got canceled [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1393.5s)]
*  This woman had had a c-section [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1399.36s)]
*  45 days ago. They had a newborn baby. They have nowhere to go nor nothing to do no plan B and it's just [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1401.5s)]
*  devastating [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1408.14s)]
*  The he also, you know Trump also designated drug cartels as a foreign terrorist organization [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1409.82s)]
*  I'm very interested to understand what that means in practice Ben. It's like are we now at war with them? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1416.18s)]
*  Are we gonna try to kill them is the US military gonna be launching strikes? [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1421.44s)]
*  I mean, this was a big conversation during the campaign [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1424.7800000000002s)]
*  I guess time will tell if it was literal the one area where Trump did not deliver on [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1427.3000000000002s)]
*  His campaign promises was on the tariffs [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1433.7s)]
*  He promised the the the the promised 25 percent tariffs on Mexico and Canada [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1436.48s)]
*  That apparently is gonna have to wait until February 1st [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1441.98s)]
*  And then I think Trump basically told agencies to study further trade issues and tariffs [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1444.68s)]
*  So long story short no 10 to 20 percent tariffs across the board on day one and no 60 percent tariffs on Chinese goods [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1450.26s)]
*  Given Ben that our mantra for this next four years is watch what he does not what he says [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1458.8s)]
*  What do you think were the most important executive actions that came out of yesterday? I [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1464.26s)]
*  Think even though it was obviously expected pulling out of the Paris agreement, you know cannot be [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1468.78s)]
*  Overstated I mean it just is [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1476.02s)]
*  debilitating to international coordination to fight climate change and you couple that with his you know [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1478.74s)]
*  Giddy references to liquid gold and drill baby drill in his inaugural dress like an expanded drilling [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1485.74s)]
*  Yeah [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1490.86s)]
*  the fact we're living in a city Tommy where it's like burning down because of climate change and [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1491.02s)]
*  It's [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1496.5400000000002s)]
*  2025 and [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1497.94s)]
*  You've got people pulling out of international climate. I mean, it's absurd to me that we are here and and so that will have real effects it will [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1499.42s)]
*  diminish [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1507.9s)]
*  America's capacity to participate in and and you'd like to be galvanizing climate action. It will [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1509.22s)]
*  totally seed the space to China as the kind of clean energy superpower and [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1516.38s)]
*  As the country that is still in this and I think what we'll see is [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1522.42s)]
*  European countries getting closer to China like so it's it's it's an ultimate own goal and [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1526.5s)]
*  People can like dunk on me for being a lib who cares about climate change [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1531.58s)]
*  But I mean all those people can be living on this planet, too [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1535.02s)]
*  So I don't know what they think they're getting out of it pulling out of the World Health Organization [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1538.4s)]
*  You know, well God forbid there's another you know pandemic or any kind of epidemic disease [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1543.06s)]
*  It will obviously make it harder to coordinate international action in that regard [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1550.14s)]
*  We live in a world as we learned during kovat where there's movement of peoples and so [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1553.78s)]
*  not being a part of the global health infrastructure is a pretty dumb thing to do and [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1558.98s)]
*  And I gee I thought we would have learned something from the pandemic that happened under Trump's watch, but obviously not [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1564.46s)]
*  I just know Tommy that you know after Joe Biden's courageous decision [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1571.9s)]
*  to [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1577.82s)]
*  Remove Cuba from the state sponsor of terrorism list a few days before he left office Trump obviously put them right back on [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1579.22s)]
*  Might have been good to do that a few years ago to give it some space. So that one [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1586.18s)]
*  Obviously not surprisingly suggested [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1592.1000000000001s)]
*  Cuba's back in its kind of [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1595.22s)]
*  In its destitution [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1598.54s)]
*  So that jumped out to me as well and and yeah in the cartels piece [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1601.14s)]
*  in addition to the potential for military action, Mexico [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1605.66s)]
*  You know enforcing those sanctions [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1609.94s)]
*  The cartels, you know that designation should mean that anybody that does any business [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1613.1000000000001s)]
*  Okay, right tells is government Mexico Mexican military, right or any I mean [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1618.78s)]
*  do you know how many cartels are worth billions of dollars and and [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1625.14s)]
*  So, you know, they control infrastructure in certain Latin American countries [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1628.74s)]
*  You know, they have front companies that do other things and so what I'm curious about [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1634.14s)]
*  Like you is the actual enforcement of just even the sanction [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1639.22s)]
*  By the way, a lot of Americans, you know, where do you think they buy the guns guys? [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1644.06s)]
*  You know, they they get the guns in the United States [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1647.14s)]
*  So if they actually want to enforce that in the same way that the US tries to enforce that with al-qaeda [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1649.22s)]
*  and in other terrorist organizations [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1655.94s)]
*  You'd be sanctioning a lot of people and entities [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1659.22s)]
*  So I'm just curious whether they that's a messaging tool or whether they're actually gonna do something with it [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1663.04s)]
*  Yeah, that one I mean just it could be so far-reaching because there's all this news reports about very senior [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1667.66s)]
*  Mexican government officials with deals or agreements or ties to cartels [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1674.26s)]
*  Senior leaders in the Mexican military as you noted all kinds of business leaders [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1678.5s)]
*  So yeah one to watch in terms of the enforcement a couple of stupid petty things Ben. I don't know if you saw Trump [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1682.9s)]
*  They got they removed the security clearances from 51 former national security officials who signed that letter back in 2020 that hunter Biden's [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1689.3000000000002s)]
*  Laptop had quote all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1696.8s)]
*  Obviously that letter was wrong. It was hedged and couched and it said, you know [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1701.5s)]
*  It's like their opinion at the time, but it was wrong [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1705.5s)]
*  And by the way, I just want to say Tommy and I'm in a mood today about this [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1707.82s)]
*  It was wrong because we were lied to by the Biden campaign [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1711.54s)]
*  I mean, I remember feeling like an idiot because they said oh, this is Russian disinformation [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1714.3s)]
*  and right so let's just be clear like the [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1719.18s)]
*  That that they should have owned up to hunters laptop [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1722.58s)]
*  But full stop. Sorry. Yeah, I mean maybe Hunter just told them what he did with it [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1726.26s)]
*  But the one thing that just jumped out at me is I don't know how many of those people still have security clearances [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1730.78s)]
*  So it just seemed like kind of stupid and petty and the other really super petty thing. I noticed they did was [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1735.7s)]
*  The Pentagon removed former chairman of the Joint Chiefs Mark Milley's portrait from the Pentagon hallway ten days after it had been put up [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1741.3400000000001s)]
*  This is the pettiest shit. I've ever heard. Well, that's what I mean by there's like a childishness to some of this stuff [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1749.7s)]
*  Like the portrait I will say it's it's an indication of [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1755.0400000000002s)]
*  You look for these indicators of how things are different this time around and we've talked about the appointments and everything [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1758.5600000000002s)]
*  Do you remember last time like something like a year or two into the Trump administration? [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1763.68s)]
*  He revoked John Brennan security clearance because Brennan was like tweeting like you scoundrel [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1767.76s)]
*  and and [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1773.64s)]
*  It was a big story. It was like wow, like they revoked John Brennan's security clearance and now we're starting [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1775.3200000000002s)]
*  There right so it's we've got a running start here, you know, and and I it's not the thing to be most upset about [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1781.9199999999998s)]
*  By any stretch but like some of those people, you know, they're there they do jobs that require them [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1788.8s)]
*  Some of them are screwed. Yeah, so some of them are actually kind of screwed weird deal. Anyway, just for folks just for context [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1793.6799999999998s)]
*  Executive orders allow the president to direct government option operations within existing law [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1800.28s)]
*  But you need an act of Congress to write a new law to actually amend a law to [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1806.82s)]
*  Appropriate money. So a lot of these EOs will end up dealing with court challenges [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1812.8600000000001s)]
*  Some of them could be struck down some of them are glorified press releases [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1817.34s)]
*  But we'll see some of them will have pretty serious impacts and obviously Trump is packed the court [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1820.58s)]
*  But Ben just a quick update on the personnel stuff [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1825.46s)]
*  So Marco Rubio was unanimously confirmed to be Secretary of State not at all surprised about that [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1828.18s)]
*  That's kind of like a free bipartisan vote for everybody [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1833.34s)]
*  Pete Hegseth passed out of the Armed Services Committee [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1835.98s)]
*  I think along partisan lines which suggests he's on track to be confirmed as Secretary of Defense, which is crazy [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1838.78s)]
*  The one nominee that is still dealing with some issues is Tulsi Gabbard [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1844.9399999999998s)]
*  Trump's pick to be the director of national intelligence [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1848.4199999999998s)]
*  Adding to her complications or political problems the Washington Post has a piece out today [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1851.1799999999998s)]
*  That is based off of a bunch of records from her congressional office [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1856.46s)]
*  I think these records were turned over maybe to the House Ethics Committee or to the vetting people [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1860.06s)]
*  Looking at her nomination [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1864.46s)]
*  And it's from the period when her aides were trying to deal with the political blowback [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1866.26s)]
*  From Tulsi's trip to Syria in meeting with Bashar al-Assad in 2017 [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1871.86s)]
*  Apparently she met with Assad for three hours [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1877.86s)]
*  Then she met with Assad's wife and then met with Assad again a day or two later [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1881.34s)]
*  But when Tulsi's trip to Syria in Lebanon was approved by the Ethics Committee her itinerary [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1886.8999999999999s)]
*  Included no meetings with Syrian officials [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1893.6599999999999s)]
*  so the very clear takeaway from this story and these emails and these back-and-forths with her staff and like edits into this Google Doc [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1896.1399999999999s)]
*  where they're trying to figure out their spin is that [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1902.8999999999999s)]
*  it sounds like Tulsi lied to her own staff about this Syria trip and [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1905.94s)]
*  Specifically tried to claim that the Assad meeting just kind of popped up once she got to Syria [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1910.34s)]
*  But then there's an email exchange about the optics of her meeting with him [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1915.78s)]
*  Literally one hour after she got into the country, so there's just seemingly no possible way this meeting with the fucking [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1919.96s)]
*  You know despot head of state in Syria just kind of happened versus being planned out. It's very fucking shady [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1927.2s)]
*  it is very shady and I want to say something nice about a couple Biden people first though, because [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1933.6s)]
*  Been a little hard on obviously Biden himself [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1940.48s)]
*  Avril Haynes who's outgoing DNI [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1943.8799999999999s)]
*  You know really extraordinary person who did under the radar very good work, right? [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1946.3600000000001s)]
*  So I just you know note that there's a very good person leaving and we got Tulsi coming in Bill Burns [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1950.8000000000002s)]
*  Obviously, you know, we talked about did a great job at CIA [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1956.8400000000001s)]
*  this thing about Tulsi [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1960.1200000000001s)]
*  In an Assad what's so alarming about this Tommy is that the best-case scenario is [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1962.16s)]
*  That she just decided to have a three-hour meeting with [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1969.3200000000002s)]
*  With Bishar al-sad an absolutely murderous dictator [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1972.72s)]
*  That there's no reason to meet with [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1978.16s)]
*  That's one end of the spectrum and then the spectrum runs all the way to like someone was like running Tulsi [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1981.04s)]
*  You know and like setting up the meeting and what's her relationship with Russia and and I don't I'm not you know [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1986.68s)]
*  like there are serious questions here that I think will be [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1992.08s)]
*  one of the things I'm struck by Tommy is that you know, she's been having meetings with senators and [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=1996.68s)]
*  You know the same senators that are like, oh, yeah Pete Hexhath. He's great [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2003.28s)]
*  You're like, you know, we need him there at the Pentagon seems so [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2008.56s)]
*  Or no, not even that like haven't you voted drunk enough? Yeah [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2012.44s)]
*  Yeah, some of those same senators seem to be alarmed by Tulsi [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2016.16s)]
*  We could just possibly but what Ben just said is a literal quote from I think Mark Wayne Mullen a senator defending Pete Hexhath [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2019.56s)]
*  Yes, like oh you care that this guy's drunk [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2026.5s)]
*  How many of you have voted drunk is if like voting tipsy for like cloture on a post office [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2028.98s)]
*  Naming is the same as like getting a call about whether or not to fire a nuke back at Russia at three of the morning [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2035.14s)]
*  That's the thing that happened [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2041.9s)]
*  That's the thing that actually happened in reality to be clear [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2044.06s)]
*  but yeah, like [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2047.42s)]
*  the intelligence community would know probably something about this meeting because [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2049.46s)]
*  Beshar al-sad is obviously somebody that the US intelligence community has been you know watching and and so what we don't know is is kind of what [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2055.68s)]
*  What is in the backdrop of this story and [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2065.24s)]
*  interestingly [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2068.36s)]
*  Again, the US intelligence community and presumably some of the people on the Senate Intelligence Committee probably know, you know [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2069.52s)]
*  So it'll it'll be an interesting hearing and it just makes what do you think? [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2074.64s)]
*  About Tommy cuz I don't like it's part of me is like is she just kind of in that weird [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2078.8399999999997s)]
*  Convergence of the left and the right where you agree with everything Russia says [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2084.64s)]
*  Because you just you know, you're in that kind of weird [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2088.4399999999996s)]
*  Tucker Carlson kind of space or does she just like a kind of attention? So she wanted to meet with Assad [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2092.3999999999996s)]
*  I know or what what is going on? It's so hard to follow because listen the very charitable version of it is [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2098.52s)]
*  She served in the US military she was deployed to Iraq [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2105.52s)]
*  She saw what a disaster it was and came back very opposed to any wars [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2108.6s)]
*  Including any US military intervention in Syria and I can totally understand that yeah [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2113.16s)]
*  yeah, but I think she also kind of got folded into the [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2117.36s)]
*  Kind of horseshoe left right place of the people who were opposed to US government surveillance [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2121.32s)]
*  And again, no problem with any of that, but she's already flip-flopped on section 702 [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2126.38s)]
*  Surveillance which is the authority that allows the intelligence community to get [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2131.56s)]
*  Information from all these American telecom companies right get into emails get into whatever texts, etc, right? [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2135.76s)]
*  So she flip-flopped on that so she's already abandoned her position there to your point on kind of the best case on this trip [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2141.46s)]
*  it like [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2147.44s)]
*  It seems like it seems quite clear that she lied to the Ethics Committee about [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2148.34s)]
*  Why she was going to Syria and then was misleading to her own staff about what she? [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2153.92s)]
*  Did while she was on the ground in Damascus, and then when she got back to the United States [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2158.7599999999998s)]
*  She was just I don't know maybe she just got dug in [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2163.8399999999997s)]
*  But she refused like eat like a month later [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2167.0s)]
*  I think [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2169.4s)]
*  Assad used chemical weapons on his own people and she went on TV casting doubt on [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2170.56s)]
*  The the the conclusion by the intelligence community that it was Assad who would use poison gas rather than the opposition [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2175.4s)]
*  So it's like what information are you getting? How are you vetting this in your own head? [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2182.2s)]
*  All these things are very important for the job [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2185.84s)]
*  She also proposed legislation that would have prevented the US government from providing funds or weapons to the Syrian opposition again like a perfectly [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2188.2400000000002s)]
*  reasonable defensible position [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2195.52s)]
*  But just strange given all this other context and she met with all these like Assad advisors and supporters Ben [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2197.52s)]
*  Including a Syrian cleric who according to the Washington Post had threatened to activate a network of suicide [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2203.36s)]
*  Bombers in the US in Europe if Western countries intervened in Syria [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2208.92s)]
*  It doesn't sound like she was meeting with like a parade of peacemakers to try to yeah, well that's a little bridge [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2213.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's right to your point [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2218.4s)]
*  Like if she really was earnestly just you know, we have to talk to everybody because we have to avoid war [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2220.0s)]
*  Why not come out and say that right, you know, why not just say for that? [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2225.32s)]
*  You know what? I think we have to talk to our enemy. I've made the case [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2228.72s)]
*  We have to talk to our enemies not just our friends and and so therefore I'm gonna meet with Assad and I wouldn't have liked [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2231.64s)]
*  That but at least it makes sense. There's something deeply strange about how she's handled this the other thing [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2236.28s)]
*  I just want to point out Tommy is it like, you know, I was took me like a few extra months to get my security clearance [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2241.46s)]
*  Just because I was honest about my past drug use on my sf-86 [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2248.14s)]
*  We're putting someone in charge of the US intelligence community that any [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2252.98s)]
*  Employees seeking a security clearance would totally get nixed for this right? [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2257.1s)]
*  Lying about because they ask you in the all these interviews, you know [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2261.7400000000002s)]
*  Have you had a girlfriend or boyfriend from a foreign country? [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2264.9s)]
*  Like all the places you've traveled they really like, you know go deep on this stuff and so literally what does it say I [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2268.2999999999997s)]
*  Know norms are out the door, you know, but there's this kind of [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2275.7s)]
*  Vast enterprise of the US government investigating people to get security clearances into work in the intelligence community [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2279.8999999999996s)]
*  But basically the person who's being put in charge [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2286.58s)]
*  Like would never pass that vet it just it is going to totally [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2289.9799999999996s)]
*  Upend the kind of you know culture and look I think they've been too stringent on things like drug use and and whatever [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2295.14s)]
*  It points to the absurdity and I'm not sure it fits with Trump's pledge yesterday in his inaugural address to to run a meritocracy [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2301.8599999999997s)]
*  Tulsi went to Syria with Dennis Kucinich and they both brought their spouses [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2311.4599999999996s)]
*  Well, why would you bring your spouse to fucking war-torn Syria in the middle of a silly? What what are you doing? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2315.7799999999997s)]
*  This is a vacation. I forgot Dennis Kucinich was alive. I know well [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2322.48s)]
*  I remember he ran against about wasn't he in oh eight primaries, but yeah [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2326.46s)]
*  He was like a gaslight candidate and a bunch of these things. Yeah, I don't know very very strange story one to watch [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2330.12s)]
*  I think look the other last week [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2335.36s)]
*  I think I said that most of Trump's nominees looked like they were out of the woods Tulsi might be the only one that's [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2337.04s)]
*  She's the only one that seems, you know, but meanwhile Casper tells is gonna skate right there. Yeah, he's loving this [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2342.2400000000002s)]
*  He's loving the his fullback [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2347.2s)]
*  All right, Ben, so the the best news since last week's show is that Israel and Hamas finally agreed to a ceasefire deal [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2349.52s)]
*  So far the deal is holding on Sunday three Israeli hostages were released by Hamas and then shortly after [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2356.3999999999996s)]
*  90 Palestinian prisoners were released by Israel [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2362.08s)]
*  The AP said that these Palestinian prisoners that Israel released were all women or teenagers who had been detained for offenses ranging from throwing rocks [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2365.0s)]
*  To promoting violence and social media to more serious allegations of attempted murder [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2373.3199999999997s)]
*  The agreement itself the broader agreement has three phases phase one is six weeks long and includes this gradual release of 33 Israeli hostages [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2378.96s)]
*  Mostly women the elderly and the sick in this phase one in exchange for about a thousand Palestinians being held by Israel [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2386.52s)]
*  In this phase the Israeli military is supposed to withdraw from population centers [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2392.84s)]
*  Gazans are supposed to be able to allow to move more freely through the Gaza Strip and return home [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2396.96s)]
*  Although they are returning to neighborhoods that are completely flattened as we discussed a minute ago [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2402.56s)]
*  And then aid is being searched into the Gaza Strip the deal calls for 600 trucks per day of humanitarian assistance to go into Gaza [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2406.76s)]
*  Phase two is supposed to be six weeks long [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2413.88s)]
*  You'd see the release of the rest of the hostages being held by Hamas along with the release of more [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2415.96s)]
*  Palestinian prisoners and the IDF is supposed to fully get out of Gaza phase three is this long reconstruction phase, but here's the rub [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2420.84s)]
*  The details of phase two and three have not been negotiated yet that process starts on day 16 of phase one [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2427.92s)]
*  So this whole deal is very tenuous [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2435.64s)]
*  and there's a smart piece in Haaretz about Israel's history of making these kind of phase deals and [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2437.92s)]
*  They never get over the finish line [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2443.68s)]
*  They never get completed and there's also the political reality that right-wing members of Netanyahu's cabinet [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2445.2s)]
*  Have said they will topple the government if the war actually ends [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2450.92s)]
*  Which is why Netanyahu and his top staff have said over and over again [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2455.16s)]
*  That Israel reserves the right to resume fighting whenever they want basically so all of that [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2459.16s)]
*  Has families of hostages very nervous and as people want to see this war and very nervous [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2464.88s)]
*  Along those lines we caught up with Maya Roman [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2470.8s)]
*  She had one family member held hostage by Hamas who was released and other another family member [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2473.12s)]
*  Killed by Hamas in the fighting. Here's a clip from Maya. Everyone keeps [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2479.6800000000003s)]
*  Keep saying it's like finally being able to take a breath because really [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2484.56s)]
*  It's so long and everyone is so tired. So the thought that it might [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2489.12s)]
*  You know be over is amazing [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2494.4s)]
*  At the same time I kept thinking that [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2497.04s)]
*  Carmel should have been here and her family should have also gotten to [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2500.6800000000003s)]
*  to hug her and Hershey's family and [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2505.1600000000003s)]
*  You know, it's hard not to get upset about the fact that we could have been here much earlier [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2508.92s)]
*  This deal is the first phase is 42 days when there are three people released every week [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2513.8s)]
*  During the first humanitarian deal there were ten people released every day and even then it was pure torture [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2520.58s)]
*  You know every day the IDF calls you to tell you if your loved one is on the list or isn't and it was gut-wrenching [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2526.9s)]
*  I cannot imagine what the families are going through now having waited so long and now it's going to [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2532.74s)]
*  Go for a full month and more the same time. We all know that the only way [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2539.74s)]
*  Forward is through we just have to get everyone back so that everyone can start to heal [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2545.2999999999997s)]
*  And I'm not just talking about the hostages or the hostage families, but you know [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2550.4199999999996s)]
*  Everyone who was near the south when this happened everyone who was relocated during this time [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2554.62s)]
*  I feel all the soldiers all the [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2560.18s)]
*  Women whose husbands went to war for a year and all the the the families of those who died [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2562.54s)]
*  It really feels like our country is still stuck on October 7th [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2568.9399999999996s)]
*  So I really hope we can [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2573.02s)]
*  Get through these next few months and finally be ready to move on I think Maya there, you know [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2576.2599999999998s)]
*  Perfectly capsulates just how agonizing even this process is after a ceasefire deal had been reached [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2582.18s)]
*  Yeah, I hadn't thought about just that that [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2586.94s)]
*  In this kind of phase withdrawal that agony of not knowing is my family member gonna be in the next [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2590.02s)]
*  Tronch or not and that's just gotta be horrific part of what's so tragic for Maya is that the pretty similar terms to [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2596.14s)]
*  The deal that was reached were on the table those terms [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2603.02s)]
*  When one of her family members was killed in Gaza and that's got to be incredibly wrenching as well [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2606.34s)]
*  So you just hope that all of the hostages that are alive are able to get out through this this deal obviously [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2612.5s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. Hope this hope this deal gets completed [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2619.82s)]
*  We can also understand why you know the families of hostages who might get out in phase two [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2623.38s)]
*  Hate this kind of phased approach right there a lot of people on the streets wanted to one deal that got everyone else out at once [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2628.5s)]
*  Obviously, that's not what happened here, but you could imagine just how terrifying it would be [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2635.62s)]
*  But then I mean there's also this you know far less relevant [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2640.3799999999997s)]
*  conversation in the US of not just how the deal got done, but who deserves credit for it [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2643.94s)]
*  So the Prime Minister of Qatar said that this deal the the outlines of this deal have been on the table since December of [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2648.4199999999996s)]
*  2023 and he said that the parties wasted 13 months negotiating details that quote [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2655.78s)]
*  No meaning and aren't worth any single life that we lost in Gaza or any single life of these hostages end quote [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2662.0600000000004s)]
*  It is hard to argue with that though [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2667.94s)]
*  I think you know US and Israeli negotiators would point out to us that the situation on the ground changed drastically [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2669.5s)]
*  Over those 13 months with Hamas getting decimated Hezbollah getting decimated and Iran getting of substantially weaker [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2675.34s)]
*  Because of the military back and forth with Israel [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2681.9s)]
*  But a reporter asked President Biden who deserves credit for the deal you or Trump and here is his response [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2685.34s)]
*  Thank you credit for this mr. President you or Trump [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2692.7799999999997s)]
*  Is that a joke oh [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2697.9s)]
*  Thank you [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2700.5s)]
*  He seems like genuinely surprised she says no [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2703.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, but [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2706.42s)]
*  Anyway, look just to cut through the bullshit on this like the Biden people clearly did months and months of diplomacy and diplomatic spade [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2708.42s)]
*  Work to like put together this this deal [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2713.54s)]
*  It's also clear that this last minute push from from Trump and his own boy Steve [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2716.1000000000004s)]
*  Woodcock got it over the finish line, and I also just want to say Ben like hand up for me [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2719.7000000000003s)]
*  I owe Steve Woodcock an apology [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2724.38s)]
*  We I hear by apologize on behalf of pod save the world and all its listeners [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2727.38s)]
*  Because I think you and I scoffed at his appointment [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2731.6600000000003s)]
*  He was just like a Trump golf buddy a real estate guy, but not only did Wyckoff reportedly push BB to take the deal [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2734.1s)]
*  NBC News reported that he's considering visiting Gaza and says he planned to be quote a near constant presence in the region [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2741.74s)]
*  Over the coming months to make sure it's implemented [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2748.2999999999997s)]
*  So a lot of this came from an NBC story that was quoting transition officials [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2750.62s)]
*  But a transition official for the Trump team said quote remember [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2754.06s)]
*  There's a lot of people radicals fanatics not just from the Hamas side [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2757.58s)]
*  From the right wing of the Israeli side who are absolutely incentivized to blow this whole deal up if we don't help the [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2760.5s)]
*  Gazans if we don't make their life better if we don't give them a sense of hope there's going to be a rebellion [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2766.04s)]
*  Endquote and bet I read that I was like yes [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2771.3399999999997s)]
*  Thank you. Finally. Someone says this like am I like a huge Steve Wyckoff fan now? I don't know [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2774.62s)]
*  I'm gonna wait and see yeah wait and see this Biden response is totally fucking absurd [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2779.18s)]
*  What planet does he think we're on like the ceasefire happened right before Trump came to office? [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2784.0s)]
*  Like I think I made clear my feelings about Donald Trump [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2789.06s)]
*  I don't like the guy but like if you're telling me that this would have happened otherwise [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2791.7400000000002s)]
*  Like give me a break if this was [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2796.5s)]
*  Clearly Trump because Trump said publicly and privately we talked about this. I was in Doha by the way [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2800.46s)]
*  I talked to some cutteries. I talked to other people [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2806.58s)]
*  Everything you heard was that Trump was telling him get this done wrap this up and and all the reporting is that Wyckoff was [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2809.46s)]
*  Like squeezing BB in a way that he had not been squeezed the entire time that Biden was in an office, right? [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2817.56s)]
*  He told him to send a high-level representative to Doha who can make decisions in real time [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2824.02s)]
*  And he was leveraging all the things Trump had done for him in the first term and being like look we did this for you [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2828.52s)]
*  You fucking owe us this. Yeah now the the dirty, you know [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2833.02s)]
*  What we don't know is whether he was also saying and here's all the other things he will do for you down the road [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2835.7799999999997s)]
*  You know, that's what we have to be worried about but still he got the deal the bottom line of this is [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2841.46s)]
*  This [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2846.44s)]
*  What did the Biden people do they negotiated the terms like? [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2847.6s)]
*  But to be clear Joe Biden stood up in front of the world early last summer and [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2851.96s)]
*  Announced that proposal as a quote Israeli proposal [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2858.3999999999996s)]
*  Israel didn't agree to what was presented by the United States as an Israeli proposal until literally like a few days ago [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2862.3199999999997s)]
*  And they had to be dragged there by Trump [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2868.72s)]
*  So they were gaslighting us that whole summer when we had kept hearing about there was an Israeli proposal that Israel had agreed to and [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2870.94s)]
*  Only Hamas is the outlier. I'm not suggesting Hamas had agreed to it, but sure as shit Israel had not agreed to that proposal [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2878.26s)]
*  So what was that about? [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2883.58s)]
*  Why I why were we generally don't understand the point of gaslighting us like that, right? [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2885.1s)]
*  It well the point is to run interference for BB Nanyo to say BB Nanyo is agreed to this ceasefire when he had not [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2891.14s)]
*  So that's one point second point is nobody should get credit for a situation in which Gaza has been completely obliterated and destroyed [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2898.06s)]
*  like the credit like they this is [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2906.1000000000004s)]
*  Like a peace deal after the place has been completely destroyed is not exactly. I mean, it's great if the hostages get home [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2908.38s)]
*  It's great that trucks are getting in and UNRWA confirmed to us that you know 600 trucks to get in that's all good [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2916.2200000000003s)]
*  But like this idea this isn't like a normal like hey we get credit thing because this horrific thing happened [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2922.54s)]
*  That's the other thing and then the last thing is this is very tenuous and Trump yesterday [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2928.86s)]
*  Was asked during that kind of rolling press conference if he was confident that the C-star holding said I'm not confident that it'll hold [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2933.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, and you got people in the Israeli government who kind of saying [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2939.98s)]
*  Wink wink like the you know, and this is where we have to be careful about what golf, you know [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2944.1400000000003s)]
*  We can resume our war, you know [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2949.1400000000003s)]
*  Like what you what you worry about is they get hostages out and then they're just kind of back in Gaza, right? [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2952.3s)]
*  So there's a lot to play out here, but I [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2957.0600000000004s)]
*  just think that [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2961.7400000000002s)]
*  man [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2963.6200000000003s)]
*  There's something quite cynical about [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2964.9s)]
*  Seeing this as an occasion for competing for credit. Yeah, I mean, I'm glad I know it's done [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2967.54s)]
*  But it's just kind of ghoulish. I'm glad the deal got done, too [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2973.94s)]
*  I think like the conversation about credit is gross and ghoulish. I do think it's worth [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2977.06s)]
*  Understanding who use leverage when and how so we can learn from the mistakes of the past in the future. Yeah [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2982.98s)]
*  It I am as worried as you are [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2989.94s)]
*  Given some of those Trump comments from yesterday and he was he was doing like the Jared Kushner thing talking about Gaza [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2992.34s)]
*  Like a developer talking about like the beachfront property, which is ominous if you want [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=2996.86s)]
*  Yeah, Gazans to live there going forward. You also have to wonder part of what cost message was like [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3001.3s)]
*  Hey, we'll let you annex the West Bank down the road. Also Trump [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3006.46s)]
*  lifted a bunch of sanctions on right-wing settler groups and individuals, I think on his first day in office and [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3010.9s)]
*  these are people who you know committed violence against Palestinians in the West Bank and [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3017.14s)]
*  Right as that happened the Israelis launched this operation in Janine in the West Bank and there were a number of settlers [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3021.3s)]
*  Attacking Palestinian communities the settlers even attacked the IDF [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3027.94s)]
*  Military members who were sent to try to break up the violence [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3032.7799999999997s)]
*  So things are real dicey and to your point about you know, just the disaster that is Gaza and like yes [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3036.5s)]
*  The the fighting has stopped but now people have to live there and that's nearly impossible with no structures [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3043.3799999999997s)]
*  We got a voice note from [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3047.62s)]
*  Shrughe la the journalist from Gaza City who is telling us about what life is like for Gazans who are returning home now [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3049.7799999999997s)]
*  Here's a clip what I'm feeling it is a [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3056.2599999999998s)]
*  Mix of complex emotions a relief that tempered by grief [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3059.7000000000003s)]
*  a relief over over the stopping of the calling and [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3066.7400000000002s)]
*  Grieve over the losing of my husband the losing of my home the losing of my sense of security and [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3072.5s)]
*  The terror that we have been enduring in the past 15 months [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3080.98s)]
*  This is fire has brought a hope a window of hope for the people here in Gaza in the future [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3085.18s)]
*  But still the future is uncertain like for example [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3091.06s)]
*  Like I've lost the family house [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3095.9s)]
*  I lost my siblings homes and my home as well [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3099.14s)]
*  So the realities is so fragile here as we don't have any place to go for [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3103.38s)]
*  So the displacement circle seems endless basically we are renting an apartment along with five [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3110.38s)]
*  Families who are almost 19 persons here in one small apartment, which is quiet [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3118.14s)]
*  Like it's too much basically the future is still [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3124.1800000000003s)]
*  Vaggie [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3128.2200000000003s)]
*  This is fire is subjected somehow to collapse because you know [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3129.5s)]
*  Just stay do they do of the sea if the implementation of this is fair and who knows what comes in the future [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3133.6600000000003s)]
*  Just a you know important reminder of how important it will be to [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3139.9s)]
*  Not only keep this ceasefire together and implement it and keep both sides sort of on track [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3142.98s)]
*  But also this reconstruction period because you know 19 people living in an apartment that is untenable. Yeah [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3147.42s)]
*  No, we talked about this in the under interview. I mean, there's also a lot of unexploded ordinance in that rubble [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3152.1s)]
*  So you can't just kind of bodies it right and bodies right? So it's gonna be painstaking just to clear the rubble [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3156.98s)]
*  and [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3163.5s)]
*  So you you just hope that the ceasefire holds the hostages get reunited with their families and people just can get some [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3164.72s)]
*  Normalcy because part of what they also have to do and you heard this in her voice [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3172.3199999999997s)]
*  They've not had time to digest the loss, you know, they've just been trying to survive [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3176.3599999999997s)]
*  Right. And so they need to take a breath there, you know, and so let's hope I mean [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3180.64s)]
*  yeah, you know if Steve Wittgoff wants to stay in the region and [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3186.3199999999997s)]
*  And and get get normalcy great, you know, I do worry, you know, I saw I just worry about yeah [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3191.88s)]
*  What was the the quid pro quo? We'll find out I guess. Yeah, we'll find out [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3199.7200000000003s)]
*  Okay, then let's talk about tick-tock for a minute [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3204.92s)]
*  As listeners know tick-tock was briefly bit blocked in the United States over the weekend [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3207.08s)]
*  Any of the 170 million people in the US who are trying to use it? [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3212.36s)]
*  Were denied their tick-tock fix when they saw a message that said quote [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3216.56s)]
*  We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate tick-tock once he takes office [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3220.36s)]
*  That was the tick-tock is banned message [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3225.96s)]
*  And then a little later when tick-tock decided to restore its own service [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3228.44s)]
*  They saw a message that said as a result of President Trump's efforts tick-tock is back in the US [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3232.36s)]
*  So just to summarize tick-tock turned off his own service and then turned it on [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3237.38s)]
*  accredited President Trump in the interim [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3241.48s)]
*  The backstory on this you know [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3244.0s)]
*  The quick back story is in his first term Trump tried to ban tick-tock kind of on the way out the door [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3245.72s)]
*  Then according to a bunch of news reports [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3249.68s)]
*  He changed his mind after meeting with a billionaire named Jeff [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3251.6s)]
*  Yes, who owns a big chunk of bite dance, which is the parent company of tick-tock and now Trump is saying he's a fan of [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3255.08s)]
*  The app he's portraying himself as a savior of the app Trump was asked about this last night during his Oval Office press conference [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3261.18s)]
*  Here is what he had to say [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3267.84s)]
*  Tick-tock why did it change my mind because I got to use it and remember tick-tock is [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3270.36s)]
*  Largely about kids young kids if China's gonna get information about young kids out of it [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3277.32s)]
*  To be honest, I think we have bigger problems in that [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3284.1600000000003s)]
*  But you know when you take a look at telephones that are made in China and all the other things that are made in China [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3287.48s)]
*  military equipment made in China [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3293.2000000000003s)]
*  I think tick-tock is not their biggest problem [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3295.2s)]
*  But there's big value in tick-tock if it gets approved if it doesn't get approved [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3299.2799999999997s)]
*  There's no value. So if we create that value, why aren't we entitled to like half banning? [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3302.96s)]
*  Tick-tock was like one of the few bipartisan things that happened in Congress 79 US senators voted to ban tick-tock [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3308.12s)]
*  Yeah, and Trump's like I who gives a fuck. Yeah, and they've all done like a whiplash on this [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3314.16s)]
*  I mean, you know people that were fervently against tick-tock are now fervently against tick-tock [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3318.9199999999996s)]
*  Fervently against tick-tock are now fervently for it. It tells you a lot [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3323.72s)]
*  I mean there is an oligarchy watch thing [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3326.9599999999996s)]
*  We made me in addition to World War watch while oligarchy watch the app kind of thanking mr [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3329.24s)]
*  Trump, you know saving them so so on the nose, right? [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3333.7999999999997s)]
*  I guess I'd just say, you know, you guys had a good conversation about this on Pots of America [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3338.2799999999997s)]
*  you know the national security perspective here is [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3342.68s)]
*  You know that the data one the massive data collection message collection [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3346.6s)]
*  And on that one I I kind of see Trump's point [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3352.4s)]
*  Like China's already hacked like they were listening to Trump's phone [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3357.44s)]
*  Like I think that the horse is out of the barn on China collecting data on on American safe [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3361.12s)]
*  Yeah, they're in every telecom company. Yeah, it may be more efficient to have their own app. But you know, I I don't share that concern I do [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3366.6s)]
*  Worry, I mean because let's let's be clear the Chinese Communist Party ultimately calls the shots for a company like this [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3375.28s)]
*  There's a reason they have not sold the US subsidiary the CCP hasn't signed off on that and it is a bit alarming [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3381.52s)]
*  That like half of Americans including young people whose minds are being formed are being fed by an algorithm [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3389.2s)]
*  That is ultimately controlled by the Chinese Communist Party like that that in you know [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3395.88s)]
*  People tick tockers can like you know roll their eyes at the stuffy national security guy [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3400.4s)]
*  but that that's just true and that that that is alarming and you just rather a US because [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3404.96s)]
*  We don't even know how the algorithm works, right? Like we it's not [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3411.08s)]
*  You know, it's it's it's proprietary information in China and what selling it to a US company would do is at least you know [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3414.7599999999998s)]
*  Now there'd be more credibility for the US government if we regulated our own tech platforms that are poisoning our young people [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3421.7999999999997s)]
*  So it's not like that is this healthy platform, you know, so I don't know what happens here [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3428.54s)]
*  You know, it seems like there's probably not a reality in which tick-tock is going to go away entirely [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3433.72s)]
*  Because Trump has decided this is now politically useful to him and he's got this kind of tech kitchen cabinet [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3440.76s)]
*  But I'm sure what he wants is an oligarch of his own to buy it and and so if this was hungry [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3447.76s)]
*  I mean, this is a test I'm gonna apply a lot to Trump administration [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3453.98s)]
*  What what they try to do is consolidate all the media underneath the Orban oligarchs [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3457.2400000000002s)]
*  And so I'm sure the outcome Trump is trying to get is Elon or somebody [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3462.04s)]
*  Yes, he's Trump II owns tick-tock and then he he controls it, you know and and splits the profits of the Chinese Communist Party [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3466.2s)]
*  It's perfect. Yeah, I think he's trying to force a sale to into the hands of one of their more favorable allies [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3474.2s)]
*  I also did enjoy the sort of interim period where all these [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3479.06s)]
*  American users were downloading another Chinese social media app called red note [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3482.24s)]
*  Chinese [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3487.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's no one cares whatever welcome to America Chinese just must be laughing at this thing, too [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3490.04s)]
*  They're like it's it's how much they're having a blast. I'm sure yeah how scared we are of an app and how it's a royal [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3496.12s)]
*  US politics [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3502.2599999999998s)]
*  Speaking of which Ben, let's talk about the the rolling mess that is happening in South Korea for a minute [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3503.56s)]
*  So listeners will remember that the chaos has reigned in South Korea since President Yoon Suk you will declared martial law in early December [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3507.72s)]
*  After a couple of tries he was impeached by South Korea's National Assembly [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3514.88s)]
*  But that is just the beginning of the saga because impeachment isn't official until it's approved by the Constitutional Court in Korea in South Korea [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3518.96s)]
*  And the president is removed so they're in this weird sort of like, you know purgatory [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3525.92s)]
*  Last week police were finally able to bring Yoon Suk you'll in for questioning on these separate criminal insurrection charges [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3530.6s)]
*  That had been challenging initially they ended up having to bring I think I heard [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3537.92s)]
*  3,000 police officers to the president's house to get him to finally turn himself in [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3541.4s)]
*  Did he answer any questions when the cops were? [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3546.8s)]
*  Interviewing him no, but I guess showing up his progress and then over the weekend Yoon was officially arrested [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3550.48s)]
*  He got the mugshot and all [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3556.6s)]
*  but even that created problems because his supporters were very pissed off and [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3558.72s)]
*  dozens of Yoon heads stormed the Seoul Western District Court [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3563.7599999999998s)]
*  Smashing windows and mirrors and just like generally causing chaos the Guardian reported that 90 people were arrested and 51 police officers were injured [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3568.0s)]
*  So [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3575.88s)]
*  Yoon and the current president condemned the violence [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3576.92s)]
*  But it doesn't mean he's you know, he's not participating in this investigation in the criminal case [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3580.28s)]
*  And Yoon says that this body that is investigating him the corruption investigation office for high-ranking officials or CIO [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3586.44s)]
*  Doesn't have the authority to even investigate him or talk to him. So they're at an impasse [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3594.08s)]
*  South Korea's president does not have immunity from these insurrection charges [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3598.6s)]
*  He could face the death penalty or life in prison if he's convicted although South Korea has not executed anyone in 30 years [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3602.16s)]
*  So it's very unlikely that will happen on Tuesday [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3608.52s)]
*  You made an appearance at his impeachment trial at the Constitutional Court there [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3611.24s)]
*  He claimed that he did not order the military to remove legislators from the assembly [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3615.3399999999997s)]
*  After he declared martial law and that his order to enact martial law was a formality that was not meant to be executed [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3620.3999999999996s)]
*  I don't really know what that means either way. This is a total mess Ben this legal saga [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3625.98s)]
*  You know, there's an impeachment in a criminal case. That's gonna be this rolling process [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3630.48s)]
*  For Yoon Seok-yul for a while [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3634.56s)]
*  But let's say Yoon is impeached and removed South Korea holds elections and the opposition Democratic Party is elected [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3636.28s)]
*  The opposition leader is this guy named Lee Jae-mung. He will likely [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3643.2400000000002s)]
*  Take South Korea's foreign policy in a totally different direction [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3647.8s)]
*  Especially their willingness to work with the US to work with Japan [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3651.32s)]
*  Under this kind of anti-China framework that both the Biden administration the Trump administration [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3654.84s)]
*  Supports and it's likely that Seoul will then be much friendlier with North Korea and Russia [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3659.88s)]
*  so it's like a bit of a careful what you wish for situation for the Trump folks because [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3665.4s)]
*  Either they get this very damaged political leader in Yoon Seok-yul [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3670.4s)]
*  Although his supporters are surprisingly rallying to him through all this madness. Yeah, it's got kind of J6 choir vibes [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3674.32s)]
*  You know, totally. Yeah, it's very Trumpy. Actually, I mean he might get just end up back in office or they get this guy from the Democratic Party [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3681.1600000000003s)]
*  Lee Jae-mung who will just disagree with them on a lot of policy [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3688.04s)]
*  Lee Jae-mung was a guy who was stabbed in the neck about a year ago to you remember that Ben? Yeah. Yeah [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3692.6s)]
*  Yeah, South Korean politics, man. It's wild [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3696.7599999999998s)]
*  No question there just a lot of [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3699.8s)]
*  My only take would be you know, because this is just playing out and it's insanely dramatic [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3703.32s)]
*  and clearly is [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3711.44s)]
*  Is you know a massive stress test for South Korea's political system to just come out the other end of this thing [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3713.68s)]
*  and [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3720.56s)]
*  I just this is in one where it's gonna be interesting what Trump does because [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3722.0s)]
*  You know, he South Korea member his only real interest in South Korea was wanting them to like [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3728.0s)]
*  Pay us more money to have troops station right there and [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3734.12s)]
*  He canceled joint exercises between the US and South Korea [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3738.8s)]
*  As like a gift to Kim Jong-un, so he's not particularly South Korea friendly and orientation and [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3742.04s)]
*  You could see a world in which he likes this guy [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3749.16s)]
*  You know because this guy is being persecuted by his own deep state or something and could royal South Korean politics that way [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3752.56s)]
*  Or you know, what is gonna be the Trump outreach to Kim Jong-un? [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3759.56s)]
*  You know if the Democratic Party does get in, you know last time Trump had [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3763.64s)]
*  Somebody who was more favorable towards engaging with the Democratic Party [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3767.72s)]
*  Towards engagement North Korea and that kind of actually made it easier for Trump to do his diplomacy [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3771.48s)]
*  So he might not mind that's true that guy so you just don't know cuz Trump's orientation is so weird [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3775.76s)]
*  I think the thing to watch in general as with Europe [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3780.42s)]
*  Japan South Korea [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3783.08s)]
*  Canada, I guess is is is the degree to which Trump kind of pushes countries into different [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3785.08s)]
*  orientations, you know these countries that have been very dependent on the US for security and for [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3791.84s)]
*  Political support in some cases for trade whether they just kind of realign [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3797.08s)]
*  I think we're Trump is gonna set in motion that so for South Korea was gonna have a tough time anyway [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3801.8399999999997s)]
*  Like if everything was totally normal in South Korea, the Trump administration be a big challenge to them given his orientation towards North Korea [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3806.44s)]
*  Now they actually have incentive I think to go the way the Democratic Party. Hey, we might need to get closer to the Chinese [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3813.52s)]
*  You know, we might need to figure out a live with Kim Jong-un [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3821.08s)]
*  That's what I would probably expect to see coming out on the other end of this [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3824.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, so another one to watch for just the general, you know uncertainty in the world right now [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3828.96s)]
*  Um finally been so it's it's 2025 by now [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3834.44s)]
*  Everyone should probably know that posting the wrong thing on social media can get you in trouble from time to time [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3838.32s)]
*  But I do I still think it's incumbent on us to call out the kind of cancel culture scolds [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3843.36s)]
*  When they go too far which brings us to the story of a Spanish man named one Bernabe [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3850.06s)]
*  He lives in Italy where he is the Falconer who handles the Eagle mascot for the Lazio soccer team in Italy [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3855.38s)]
*  It's a Syria team one posted photos and videos of his own [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3862.7s)]
*  brand-new prosthetic penis on Instagram and he got fired for that the [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3866.9s)]
*  The Associated Press described the prosthetic surgery as quote for non-medical reasons [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3872.2999999999997s)]
*  I wasn't sure how to read between the lines there, but luckily the Atlantic had us covered they quoted [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3876.96s)]
*  Bernabe saying quote I had the surgery to increase my sexual performance because I'm very active my erection is normal [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3882.16s)]
*  But with this device I press a button that allows me to be able to perfectly control both the erection and the duration [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3887.92s)]
*  But you know what Ben that got him fired. This poor man just posted his dong on [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3894.2s)]
*  On Instagram, he basically RFK jr. The thing and he got fired [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3899.28s)]
*  But you know it didn't get him fired Ben the time back in 2021 when the same gentleman was filmed doing a fascist salute [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3903.3199999999997s)]
*  Enchanting duke duke in honor of the late fascist Italian leader Benito Mussolini at a soccer game [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3910.7999999999997s)]
*  So, I don't know cancer culture giveth and taketh away. First of all kind of remarkable that you found that in the [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3917.68s)]
*  August pages of the Atlantic [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3925.56s)]
*  I [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3927.56s)]
*  Thought you said the Atlantic the athletic okay, that's better. I mean I would have liked you they might do car covers [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3930.7999999999997s)]
*  I [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3936.68s)]
*  was like say like you know is is is is Elliott Cohen branching out in his [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3937.08s)]
*  Writing a radio free Tom, you know on the Falconer beat [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3943.16s)]
*  the the look [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3947.84s)]
*  I [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3950.04s)]
*  Will say I thought Trump was gonna set fix this I mean [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3951.52s)]
*  Like he's not delivering right like where's the speech? [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3955.7200000000003s)]
*  Where is the free fucking speech like we heard yesterday that free speech is back cancel culture is over [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3958.4s)]
*  You know obsessions with gender and you know [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3963.36s)]
*  So, you know what? We're 24 hours in Trump administration [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3966.96s)]
*  And so long as this guy's canceled, it just feels like Trump did not bring the change. He promised, you know [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3970.36s)]
*  Yeah, let this guy, you know hang some prosthetic [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3975.92s)]
*  I [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3979.2400000000002s)]
*  Something out there for whatever it is for display this guy's uh, yeah this Eagles named Olympia [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3980.4s)]
*  They played the stadio olympico. He's also a big fan of the Vox party the far-right party [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3985.28s)]
*  Yeah, so this guy's not just keeps getting less sympathetic with with each piece of information [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3989.6000000000004s)]
*  every word, but I I I will say that the whole thing has [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3993.76s)]
*  RFK junior vibes, you know from the Falconing to the [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=3998.76s)]
*  I [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4003.04s)]
*  Well, is that is that I was gonna say something about like new age medicine [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4004.2400000000002s)]
*  But I guess a prosthetic penis it follows your command structures something different [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4008.76s)]
*  I don't really know what can't put that in this is the first I heard of that being a thing one can [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4013.92s)]
*  Anyway, good luck to our friends in Italy [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4019.7200000000003s)]
*  We are gonna take a quick break when you come back though [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4022.44s)]
*  You'll hear Ben's interview with Sam Rose the acting director of UNRES affairs in Gaza. Please stick around for that [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4024.56s)]
*  It will be a much more thoughtful serious conversation than the one we just had for the last five minutes [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4030.6s)]
*  All right [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4035.2799999999997s)]
*  We're gonna take a quick break [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4035.7599999999998s)]
*  But as you can tell from listening to this the next four years are going to be challenging and disorienting here at crooked [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4036.52s)]

*  People you know sounds of kind of normal sounds on well normal sounds on the street [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4301.46s)]

*  I mean you hear it momentarily, but parents were very you know kind of [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4317.820000000001s)]

*  so families stuck together and families stayed indoors because of the constant threat of [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4326.120000000001s)]
*  Bombardment and attacks that that have vanished almost immediately [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4331.5s)]

*  Somebody told me they just wanted to go into a room for two days have some privacy and cry [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4340.74s)]
*  But you know people were feeling something that they'd not felt for 16 months or another central since November [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4345.58s)]
*  2023 when the first ceasefire came in into effect [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4352.38s)]

*  But what we have had in the past couple of days is people have in the south and in the central parts of Gaza [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4369.1s)]
*  Have been able to go back to their home so as as the kind of initial euphoria has [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4374.94s)]
*  subsided, you know, it's been replaced a bit with [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4381.66s)]
*  with I guess kind of [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4385.54s)]
*  prepidation and just [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4387.9s)]

*  Don't know a [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4391.58s)]
*  how best to put it a kind of gaping hole in people's stomach as they've [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4393.0199999999995s)]
*  Realized and they start coming to terms with the enormity of what what's happened to them [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4397.62s)]
*  Even when the ceasefire hit people were had this mix of fear hope and trepidation [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4402.46s)]
*  But what we've seen from people the last couple of days is you know, people are a bit more downhearted [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4406.98s)]
*  They've gone home. They've had confirmed with their own eyes that the home is no longer there [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4412.0199999999995s)]
*  Some people have retrieved bodies from from the rubble of their homes and it's just starting to dawn on everyone [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4417.0s)]
*  Just you know how bad things were these kind of emotions that people kept [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4423.04s)]
*  Bustled up inside [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4428.76s)]
*  compartmentalized in part of their brain because they were just focused on the day-to-day business of survival and certainly our staff working [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4430.68s)]
*  Blocking out what was inside there now, you know starts thing to kind of come to terms with that [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4437.68s)]
*  And it's gonna be a long and difficult process [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4442.58s)]
*  Yeah, I I mean I truly can't imagine I mean in speaking of the needs UNRWA has obviously been [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4444.7s)]
*  You know one of the only lifelines [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4451.86s)]
*  to the Palestinian people in Gaza [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4454.78s)]
*  The ceasefire agreement called for 600 trucks of aid to get in a day [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4458.14s)]
*  What are you focused on right now as an organization like what I because I can't even get my mind around the scale of the challenges [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4464.22s)]
*  What what is most needed to get in for the people of Gaza and what is UNRWA doing to help facilitate that? [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4471.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean absolutely this as you'll know from the start of the war this one of the main [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4477.8s)]
*  Narratives of this conflict has been about trucks and about supplies [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4482.4s)]
*  Getting getting in it's not ideal because it dehumanizes the people but it's the fact that it's been incredibly difficult [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4488.76s)]
*  to get those supplies in so [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4495.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah day three is [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4498.12s)]
*  Is is far and the numbers that we're meeting those targets that is the target of trucks entering from Israel [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4500.76s)]
*  Into the crossing points inside Gaza, whether that be in the south or in the north [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4508.0s)]
*  What we're actually bringing into Gaza and distributing is is something slightly different but but regardless there's large volumes of aid [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4515.04s)]
*  That that are coming in and that's great because we've not seen that for several months [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4522.360000000001s)]
*  But what's coming in right now? [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4526.62s)]
*  Are essentially supplies that have been outside Gaza for several months because the crossing points were so choked [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4528.94s)]
*  They were so constrained by a mixture of things that there was just a large large backlog of things [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4535.5199999999995s)]
*  Outside what we're focused on and the bulk of that it's food [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4542.099999999999s)]
*  It's flour to get bakeries running its food parcels that we ordered [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4546.34s)]
*  for populations on the verge of famine and it's [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4551.74s)]
*  Basic shelter items so you know in the humanitarian toolkit we bring in mattresses [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4556.34s)]
*  We bring in blankets. We bring in tarpaulins [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4563.139999999999s)]
*  Plastic sheets things of that nature [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4566.26s)]
*  So this is critical to get this in and get it out in large volumes just to take the edge off thing because people [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4569.0599999999995s)]
*  Haven't had food [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4576.0599999999995s)]
*  You know on the verge of starvation people are living in the most squalid and appalling of shelter conditions [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4577.62s)]
*  But a lot more needs to be done beyond that initial phase and and as unwrote we would look [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4583.74s)]
*  initially to [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4590.86s)]
*  Rehabilitates and repair our critical infrastructure so that alongside [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4593.26s)]
*  provision of basic humanitarian aid we're also able to [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4598.94s)]
*  To resume some of our basic services now [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4604.0199999999995s)]
*  Everything is made more complicated by [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4608.34s)]
*  Well by firstly by the situation facing unroam [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4611.14s)]
*  Maybe that's something we'll come to in in a bit, but by the kind of prerequisites to [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4613.46s)]
*  to [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4619.38s)]
*  Safe delivery of aid right now in Gaza and and two things come to mind in relation to that one is [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4621.02s)]
*  What we do about all the unexploded bombs and the munitions. I mean, it's been an incredibly intense [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4627.900000000001s)]
*  Bombardment for 15 60 months across most of Gaza [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4634.42s)]
*  So people who returning to their homes their buildings, there's lots of [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4637.74s)]
*  Ordinance there and [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4643.42s)]
*  We're not yet in a position to safely take that ordinance away. It has to be done through the national authorities [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4645.42s)]
*  But we do lots of raising awareness mine risk education [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4651.099999999999s)]
*  Education on explosive remnants of war things things like that [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4655.42s)]
*  It's sadly been a part of what we've been teaching kids in Gaza since 2008 2009 [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4659.139999999999s)]
*  So since then we've had a cycle of what five five five conflicts [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4664.94s)]
*  So it's something that we have in hand. We have it in Arabic. We have the multimedia [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4669.5s)]
*  Capability to get the message out unroam. We've got over 10,000 12,000 staff [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4675.38s)]
*  So we've got the staff on the ground who can disseminate those those messages [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4680.26s)]
*  So a key thing that we need to do to as a prerequisite to you know, for aid and safe returns is is that [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4683.86s)]
*  Is that that that awareness raising we also need to keep track of where people are and where people are moving to [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4693.66s)]
*  Because a lot of the aid operation in Gaza has been focused in Mawassi [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4700.5s)]
*  On the west on the coast and that's where the services have been, you know [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4704.9s)]
*  Structured around at least the kind of temporary humanitarian [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4710.139999999999s)]
*  Services aid trucking water trucking things like that as people move back [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4713.74s)]
*  We have to support them where they're where they're going back to as as unra we have [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4718.0599999999995s)]
*  You know boreholes in refugee camps that we can restore we have wells in our shelters that we can also restore [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4723.38s)]
*  I mean restoration of water is critical to get people to to to to return but people won't be returning and [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4730.66s)]
*  permanently in large numbers [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4737.259999999999s)]
*  Right now that requires a massive effort in terms of rubble removal in terms of like I say the the the removal of the the [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4739.139999999999s)]
*  Ordnance and the munitions and things like that. So it is gonna be a gradual long term process [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4747.66s)]
*  I mean, yeah, you mentioned a lot there about shelter. I mean [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4752.38s)]
*  You know the imagery that we're seeing [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4756.26s)]
*  Which you're obviously seeing on the ground, but I mean North Gaza looks like, you know, Hiroshima. I mean it did [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4759.0599999999995s)]
*  There's just you know [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4765.62s)]
*  No structure standing. It's just all rubble. I mean where [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4767.66s)]
*  Where where are people going to to live? [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4772.26s)]
*  You know, how do you even think about the scale of the short-term [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4775.339999999999s)]
*  housing needs versus the kind of obviously longer-term reconstruction effort if it assuming peace holds [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4780.099999999999s)]
*  Just what is the sense of [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4787.379999999999s)]
*  Of how I mean you have any sense of what what percent of homes are left after after this horrific bombardment? [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4790.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it is the scale of it is is vast [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4798.339999999999s)]
*  Northern Gaza has essentially been [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4802.54s)]
*  Obliterated and the vast majority of homes and buildings have either been destroyed or badly badly damaged [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4805.18s)]
*  Now we faced wars in Gaza before but nothing nothing like this where entire neighborhoods [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4813.18s)]
*  Have been have been wiped out and and it is quite striking you drive around Northern Gaza or Gaza City and you know amongst [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4818.7s)]
*  The rubble you will find a house or a you know [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4825.9s)]
*  That somehow remains standing or within a [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4829.1s)]
*  Multi-story building a room that has washing hanging outside. So people are living living in it [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4832.700000000001s)]
*  But even where these buildings are standing people can't get them because of all the rubble. Yeah all the [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4838.46s)]
*  There's the stuff on the ground because Gaza was so overcrowded [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4844.22s)]
*  I mean Gaza City was quite high-rise that even for those buildings that remain standing for people physically and safely to to kind of get [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4847.18s)]
*  There and and come and go and for services to be restored is is a is a massive task and look what we're [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4855.82s)]
*  What we're looking at is people being out of their homes [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4863.0199999999995s)]
*  For a long long time and there's there's a number of things that the [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4867.98s)]
*  That we can do we can we can move from the kind of very temporary very basic shelter [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4872.139999999999s)]
*  Which comprises top all ins plastic sheets [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4878.78s)]
*  Basic mattresses and and things like that to provide people with a bit more stability [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4881.98s)]
*  So that if they're out for for some time at least they are in somewhere [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4888.0599999999995s)]
*  That's a bit more comfortable the problem that we've had in in Gaza or one of the problems we've had over the past [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4892.3s)]
*  16 months is that there have been these repeated cycles of displacement [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4897.58s)]
*  Yeah, we had people moving, you know, people have been displaced five or ten times [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4901.0199999999995s)]
*  They've been constantly taking with them these rocks and they've been constantly being taken with them [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4905.98s)]
*  These rotten plastic sheets [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4911.099999999999s)]
*  And and reinstalling them where they're where they are. So for the people who are unable to go home, it's about making [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4913.34s)]
*  that that shelter more or [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4920.219999999999s)]
*  You know more comfortable so that they can live in a in a in a bit of dignity in in conditions that are fit for [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4924.0599999999995s)]
*  For humans to live in recognizing that they're likely to be there for for quite some time [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4931.82s)]
*  But what we will also see is people [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4936.62s)]
*  You know if people's houses have been burned or damaged there may be one or two rooms that still remain standing so [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4939.42s)]
*  and people here it's an extended family community, so typically the [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4947.5s)]
*  The the the the father of the household will live on the ground floor when his children get married his sons get married [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4951.98s)]
*  They would build an extra story on on top [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4958.3s)]
*  So there's kind of multiple generations of the same family living in in the same building quite a lot and there may be one or two [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4961.0199999999995s)]
*  Rooms that are fit for for habitation. So what people will do? [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4967.02s)]
*  Or what we assume they will do is that they will start from there. There'll be lots of people living [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4972.540000000001s)]
*  In one or two rooms and families will just start to rebuild themselves bit by bit [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4977.660000000001s)]
*  A room here or a room there putting windows back in etc [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4984.14s)]
*  I mean people aren't going to do that right now given the uncertainty [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4988.22s)]
*  Over the the ceasefire prospects and given the lack of basic materials on on the ground because we're bringing aid in right now [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4992.08s)]
*  We're not bringing in large supplies [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=4999.599999999999s)]
*  Uh for for reconstruction and we need you know equipment [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5002.0s)]
*  We need uh, we need uh tracks as we need bulldozers. We need we need all these things and the the other bit [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5005.2s)]
*  I I would say is that right now there are a couple of hundred thousand people sheltering in unrest schools [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5011.599999999999s)]
*  Uh, I mean we [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5016.88s)]
*  We have 300 schools in garbs [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5019.76s)]
*  We're in about 200 school buildings and and close to a hundred of them are functioning as emergency shelters [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5021.76s)]
*  And right now we've got a couple hundred thousand people living in in those shelters again [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5028.16s)]
*  Some of those people will be able to move out and move back home [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5032.8s)]
*  but we can anticipate that there'll be a lot of people that that that need to remain for for a long time because [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5036.320000000001s)]
*  They've not got anywhere else to go and and the challenge [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5043.280000000001s)]
*  With garza is on the yeah [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5048.320000000001s)]
*  On the one hand you've got all this rubble that needs to be removed and some of the estimates run into years [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5049.68s)]
*  In terms of how long that that's going to take but in general that there isn't much space. It's a very very overcrowded [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5054.160000000001s)]
*  Piece of of land so the idea that you can kind of decant people out of one structure move them move them somewhere else [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5062.0s)]
*  Is is is not feasible because the land simply isn't available so some of the high level thinking has gone into this but not [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5069.44s)]
*  Not all the lower level thinking yet because it requires a complete urban [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5078.4s)]
*  Regeneration it requires working at community level to understand with families with notables [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5083.179999999999s)]
*  What is going to be acceptable to them and all this can really only happen when there's a functioning governance structure [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5089.44s)]
*  In place to kind of oversee that redesign [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5096.8s)]
*  Yeah, well, I mean looming over this is the fact that [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5100.0s)]
*  Israel has passed a ban on unra that is supposed to begin [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5103.92s)]
*  In a week or two, I think and [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5109.84s)]
*  I mean you you you've already alluded to how deeply embedded you are in the society [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5112.24s)]
*  I mean hundreds of schools sheltering hundreds of thousands of people getting food to people [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5117.28s)]
*  Over 10 000 employees, I mean how are what happens when this you know ban goes into effect? I mean, how are you [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5123.12s)]
*  What does that mean for you? How are you preparing for it? [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5130.96s)]
*  And what would it mean for the people of gaza if it went forward? [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5134.24s)]
*  Yeah, we don't know [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5138.719999999999s)]
*  Precisely what it will mean the ban covers [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5140.48s)]
*  Our our activities in the occupied palestinian territory and what it what it prohibits [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5145.04s)]
*  Is unra's activities on the sovereign's territory of of israel number one and number two prohibits [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5152.24s)]
*  interaction [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5159.82s)]
*  Uh an engagement between unra and and israeli officials now gaza isn't the sovereign territory of of israel [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5160.88s)]
*  But we come and go [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5168.639999999999s)]
*  through israeli borders we bring our supplies in [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5170.8s)]
*  through israeli borders when the the the comp when there's a conflict we [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5175.5199999999995s)]
*  Coordinate and notify israel of of all our movements and we engage with them when there are critical incidents if staff are stuck [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5181.26s)]
*  in in in certain [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5189.360000000001s)]
*  Locations so if the if the bills come in and are implemented to full effect at the end of this month it makes it incredibly [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5191.42s)]
*  Difficult for unra to keep operating [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5199.360000000001s)]
*  In gaza our international staff myself included wouldn't be able to to come and go [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5202.64s)]
*  Uh it you know [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5209.28s)]
*  Interpreted to the letter of the law [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5211.599999999999s)]
*  We wouldn't be able to bring supplies in and others wouldn't be able to do that [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5213.28s)]
*  On our on our behalf and this would be you know [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5217.759999999999s)]
*  catastrophic at any moment in time given how central unra is [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5220.62s)]
*  As a mechanism for delivery of aid and provision of basic services, but right now [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5226.16s)]
*  Uh [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5232.639999999999s)]
*  It's catastrophic for the entire [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5233.92s)]
*  Population of of gaza this [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5236.72s)]
*  Now with the ceasefire in effect. It isn't about unra. This is about [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5240.32s)]
*  the humanity and the values that we stand for [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5245.52s)]
*  as a humanitarian community in terms of meeting the needs of the population of of gaza if you rip out unra [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5248.96s)]
*  Then you rip out the the largest single [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5256.8s)]
*  actor [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5259.66s)]

*  That doesn't exist in other parts of the world [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5281.04s)]
*  There's an instrument that the international community has at its disposal that covers half the response [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5283.4400000000005s)]
*  You know 13 000 staff we have in in gaza the rest of the the aid community [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5290.16s)]

*  We accept that given the complexities and given the savagery of what happened on on october 7th and and and since then [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5324.96s)]
*  It's already fragile. But if you take out the largest single actor [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5332.5599999999995s)]
*  Capable of supporting and delivering on on the response you make it, you know close close to impossible [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5337.44s)]
*  You send a message to the people of gaza that [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5343.84s)]
*  That whilst there are humanitarian commitments linked to the ceasefire where we're abandoning them [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5347.360000000001s)]
*  They are being abandoned and and what signal that will send for the for the stability [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5352.16s)]
*  Of of the situation here the shock the trauma the grief it will cause but it also risks having more regional [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5359.52s)]
*  Impact so for the sake of the ceasefire. It's absolutely catastrophic [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5367.6s)]
*  That this is happening and that this is happening now and we're trying everything within our means [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5372.5s)]
*  To to halt it, but where are you an agency? We we can only work through the member states [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5377.54s)]
*  So we're calling on member states to do everything that that they can to make sure that we are not ripped out of here [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5382.66s)]
*  At the end of of the month because it's a situation that absolutely no one wants and no one needs [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5389.78s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's it's kind of [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5395.06s)]
*  A boundless cruelty. I I don't know how to even get my mind around it [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5397.14s)]
*  I I mean how many do you have any sense of how many unremployed have have have been killed in the in the last? [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5400.820000000001s)]

*  200 and 260 personnel that we've lost now since the 7th of [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5415.780000000001s)]
*  of october [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5420.58s)]

*  At the wrong time, uh, you know on the road in their home [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5433.46s)]
*  whatever the nature of the [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5437.78s)]
*  Conflict is such that it's such a built up overcrowded area [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5440.42s)]
*  in in and you know [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5444.82s)]
*  You know placing overcrowded placing guards that the the munitions that are being used it's inevitable that large numbers of people [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5446.82s)]
*  Are are going to be killed and and it's not just staff who've been killed. It's their family members [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5455.219999999999s)]
*  As as well [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5461.94s)]
*  I mean every single person here has suffered [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5462.74s)]
*  immeasurably in ways that we can only begin to comprehend when we [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5465.92s)]
*  Drive around when we see the photos we see the drone footage [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5469.38s)]
*  Etc the depth of the destruction [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5472.82s)]
*  of you know [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5476.02s)]
*  Physical structures, but also people and communities is really really hard to to get your head around and quite shocking [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5477.46s)]
*  Yeah, well last question. I wanted to ask you is you know, you've been in and you've been working in gaza for a long time [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5484.9800000000005s)]
*  in and out [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5491.62s)]
*  Obviously that that's part of your vocation as a humanitarian worker, but also [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5494.18s)]
*  Presumably because you you you care obviously about the people there [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5499.280000000001s)]
*  And there's so much dehumanizing [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5503.9400000000005s)]
*  you know rhetoric whether it's [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5506.66s)]
*  obviously the way in which [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5508.66s)]
*  People in not just israel, but in the united states kind of cast [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5511.3s)]
*  You know everybody's a terrorist or everybody's hamas [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5515.54s)]
*  Or even people that are well-meaning. It's always as you pointed out earlier. It's numbers, right? [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5518.740000000001s)]
*  It's it's x number of people have died or x number of trucks are getting in [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5523.3s)]
*  What would you want people to know about? [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5527.62s)]
*  the the human beings [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5531.14s)]

*  I know that's kind of an open-ended question, but that's kind of I wanted to leave it to you [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5537.299999999999s)]
*  What what is the world not seeing here about the humanity of the people that have just been through something? [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5541.7s)]
*  That that you know is beyond belief really [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5547.62s)]
*  Yeah, no, it is of beyond belief and people of gaza have been through a lot before this but this is on a completely [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5550.98s)]
*  Different level and you know, we want to say that they're normal people [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5557.759999999999s)]
*  I mean what they've gone through is is completely abnormal and what's become normal is completely unacceptable [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5562.099999999999s)]
*  and and abnormal but the [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5569.219999999999s)]
*  You know people here want what we want most people here are children half the population. Let's say it's under 18 [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5572.419999999999s)]
*  You know cause for the population under 10 that that the colleagues that I know the people that I work with [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5580.259999999999s)]
*  They want what everyone else wants they want [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5587.14s)]
*  Safety for their family. They want to be able to go to sleep at night and not worry about what's [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5590.42s)]
*  Going to happen to them [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5595.860000000001s)]

*  Understand why? [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5621.3s)]
*  This is happening to them. They've there's nothing [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5623.7s)]
*  They can do about the situation that they're in and we got people here that have just seen in the world watching this [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5628.1s)]
*  Constantly for the last 16 months and not been able or willing to do anything about it. But people here want the same [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5635.3s)]
*  That we want they they want to I mean they're very family oriented here. It's a close-knit [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5642.1s)]
*  Community people stay where where they are a lot of them are refugees. So they have contacts in diasporas around the world [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5647.46s)]
*  But people are pretty modest expectations [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5654.42s)]
*  Here, but they want to work [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJf5rrwPUDs&t=5658.26s)]
