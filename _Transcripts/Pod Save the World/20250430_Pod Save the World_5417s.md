*  You could have to do some deep breathing [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=111.33999999999999s)]

*  I mean we talk a lot about the politics of this and what politicians are saying [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=141.06s)]
*  But this is someone who literally documents war crimes on a regular basis [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=144.86s)]
*  Someone who's been a justice advocate and so we talk about what's the perspective of being in Ukraine right now? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=150.14000000000001s)]

*  About the politics of things when you're still living through a war and so it's a perspective that we need to bring to bear [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=163.1s)]
*  How are Ukrainians thinking about what justice means for what's happened to them? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=168.38s)]

*  Kind of what sustains her and keeps her going what her vision for the future of Ukraine? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=178.22s)]
*  What it should be so it's very very powerful perspective that we don't hear enough from in terms of Ukraine [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=183.1s)]
*  On the front lines. So check it out [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=189.73999999999998s)]
*  Did you ask her to say thank you and was she wearing a suit? Yeah [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=191.94s)]
*  Well, you know to be honest like listen to this interview [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=195.42s)]
*  I know I said this guy give me your office listen to this interview and then imagine JD Vance [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=198.5s)]
*  saying [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=204.57999999999998s)]
*  You know, did you thank us while you're listening to it and you'll you'll know what I'm getting at when you hear the yeah [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=206.14s)]
*  Ben was describing to me some of the details and all I could think of was that Oval Office meeting and how embarrassing [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=212.22s)]
*  Our leaders are and how embarrassing a lot of our press corps is too and and by the way, you know [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=218.14s)]
*  What was kind of heartbreaking is she did say thank you [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=222.34s)]
*  You know without me even asking her for what Americans have done for Ukraine, which she did not need to do some until JD [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=225.1s)]
*  All right, Ben [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=232.74s)]
*  So let's start with our buddies in Canada and everyone should check out that interview [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=233.62s)]
*  President Trump has had a big 100 days and he can now add to the list losing a Canadian election to his list of accomplishments [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=237.01999999999998s)]
*  so [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=243.14s)]
*  Golf clap to him former central banker Mark Carney won the Liberal Party its fourth consecutive term in office [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=244.26s)]
*  This outcome was almost impossible to imagine back in December or January [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=250.01999999999998s)]
*  When Prime Minister Justin Trudeau started getting into serious political trouble and then resigned at the time [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=255.29999999999998s)]
*  The Conservative Party was ahead by as many as 25 points in some polls [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=260.44s)]
*  But then Donald Trump decided to open his big stupid mouth [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=264.53999999999996s)]
*  He was threatening to destroy the Canadian economy with tariffs put in place a lot of those since [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=269.21999999999997s)]
*  and he's been threatening to make Canada the 51st state and [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=273.5s)]
*  Suddenly within Canada a debate erupted over who can best stand up to Trump and that became the defining issue of this election [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=276.78s)]
*  And the results are in and Canadian voters have decided that not only was Conservative Party leader Pierre Polyev [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=282.73999999999995s)]
*  Not the right guy to defend Canada from Trump Polyev even lost his own seat in Parliament. So tough night for them [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=289.26s)]
*  It's also not clear whether he's gonna remain the leader of the party itself. So head spinning stuff here, Ben [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=296.02s)]
*  This is a clip from Prime Minister Mark Carney's victory speech Monday night as I've been warning for months [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=300.62s)]
*  America wants our land our resources our water our country [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=308.34s)]
*  Never [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=316.18s)]
*  But these are not [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=317.34s)]
*  These are not idle threats [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=319.02s)]
*  President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=322.02s)]
*  That will never that will never ever happen when I sit down with President Trump [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=327.9s)]
*  It will be to discuss the future economic and security relationship between two sovereign nations [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=334.09999999999997s)]
*  And it will be with our full [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=345.7s)]
*  Knowledge that we have many many other options than the United States to build prosperity for all Canadians [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=349.58s)]
*  I love the dude kind of like calmly yelling shame [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=357.34s)]
*  So just a couple thoughts but first of all [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=363.58s)]
*  I mean it is impossible to overstate how massive this comeback was for the Liberal Party and what an own goal it was [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=365.53999999999996s)]
*  For Trump Trump could have had an ideologically compatible leader in Canada that he could work with instead [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=371.58s)]
*  He has a guy who was literally elected with a mandate to fight him. So that's his new political reality [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=377.5s)]
*  Not a weak one like Justin Trudeau like a freshly installed [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=383.9s)]
*  Mark Carney also you and I were laughing about how you know, you don't see a lot of pundits or pollsters talking about how [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=387.78000000000003s)]
*  The angry electorate and the kind of like populist curious countries all over the world [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=394.66s)]
*  That people are looking for some like globalist central banker with degrees from Harvard and Oxford [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=399.34000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, but that is what Canadians just voted for like they wanted competence and stability [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=404.98s)]
*  And they didn't care that Mark Carney is Steve Bannon's worst nightmare [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=409.7s)]
*  Yes, this is a huge [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=413.62s)]
*  Upset result in the context of where this race stood a couple of months ago and I mean to unpack a couple pieces of this [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=416.66s)]
*  the first obvious point is you made is that Trump has [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=424.66s)]
*  Essentially accelerated a backlash to trumpism globally in ways that we need to continue to watch [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=428.54s)]
*  Canada is the obvious first place where his threats his disrespect his disregard [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=435.14s)]
*  For the US-Canada relationship and for Canadian sovereignty clearly [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=441.61999999999995s)]
*  Led to this massive pendulum swing to Mark Carney, but it's not the last place [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=446.17999999999995s)]
*  We've talked about the fact that Australia has an election coming up where the center-left labor Prime Minister Albanese [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=449.9s)]
*  Had been losing in polls and is now at least even if not in the lead [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=455.82s)]
*  By the way, very smart of Canadians and hopefully Australians because if you want to learn something from us [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=461.65999999999997s)]
*  Don't take this risk, you know, you may not get your country back [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=467.97999999999996s)]
*  If it goes down this road and that leads to a second point [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=471.34s)]
*  Which is it you know poly I've really did try to kind of tread in this Trump light space where you know, they were increasingly [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=473.73999999999995s)]
*  You know bombastic xenophobic, you know [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=481.06s)]
*  You had him trying to kind of capture the energy we saw in that kind of weird trucker anti, you know, shut down [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=483.9s)]
*  protest in Ottawa you saw an increasingly [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=491.5s)]
*  right-wing media [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=494.85999999999996s)]
*  Ecosystem growing up in Canada and so I think you know voters are not dumb [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=496.5s)]
*  They saw wait a second [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=500.46s)]
*  This might feel good to some of us because we're tired of globalism or tired of you know [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=501.7s)]
*  The elites or we think Justin Trudeau is in there for too long [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=506.5s)]
*  But it's really dangerous to go down this road both because it could weaken us to Trump [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=509.82s)]
*  But also because it could turn us into kind of a weaker version of Trump, you know [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=515.26s)]
*  And and so if Trump actually doing the things that he said he wanted to do in the second term the way they did in [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=519.3s)]
*  The first it could be the breaking point for the momentum for this kind of politics and democracies. We have to watch that [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=525.58s)]
*  And we'll see, you know, yeah [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=531.5400000000001s)]
*  Mark Carney, I mean Mark Carney did his best to tie Pierre poly up to Trump in every way [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=533.6600000000001s)]
*  I think they were calling him Trump light. They were kind of like making videos of them morphing into each other [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=538.4200000000001s)]
*  So they really did become the defining issue. Yeah. Yeah. And now the second thing, you know, David Axelrod our former [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=542.14s)]
*  guru on the Obama campaign used to say that [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=549.3000000000001s)]
*  Americans look for the opposite person of the previous person and so the first time he said this was in [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=553.62s)]
*  2008 when Obama was very much an opposite of Bush, you know [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=560.58s)]
*  But actually if you stretch it forward, you know, Trump is kind of an opposite of Obama Biden's got an opposite. It's like a pretty [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=564.82s)]
*  Pretty coherent way of looking at things and look Carney is not only someone who stands up to Trump [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=571.94s)]
*  He's the opposite of Trump, you know a man with deep experiences [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=576.9000000000001s)]
*  A man with deep experience in international finance at the Bank of Canada and at the Bank of England [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=580.98s)]
*  A man with experience managing crises instead of creating crises [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=587.86s)]
*  dealing with the financial crisis in a way in Canada dealing with brexit in 2015 and [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=592.1s)]
*  What we've seen is he's already kind of brushed back Trump, you know [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=597.0600000000001s)]
*  One of the more interesting reports I saw Tommy said in the one phone call they had in which Trump came out and actually didn't [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=601.02s)]
*  disparage [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=607.58s)]
*  Carney in the same way they did Trudeau [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=609.06s)]
*  There's a rumor that Carney threatened to dump all of America's bonds, you know, and and he knows what he's doing [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=611.06s)]
*  He's the former center bank. He knows where he's got leverage points and we've already seen Canada [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=616.6999999999999s)]
*  You know sign LNG deals with China like this is a man [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=622.5s)]
*  Who isn't just talking the talk like he actually knows [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=626.8199999999999s)]
*  How to kind of run circles around Trump even with Canada being a much smaller and more vulnerable economy [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=630.3399999999999s)]
*  Even as Canada may have to absorb an enormous hit from tariffs and things that Trump's doing [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=636.4399999999999s)]
*  This is a guy that that knows how to work the system that America created that Trump doesn't understand [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=640.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, this is becoming Trump's Achilles heel. You also you're also seeing this with the Chinese [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=647.68s)]
*  They know the weaknesses and pressure points. We also Carney also [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=651.36s)]
*  Took some steps to distance himself not just in words, but in policy from Trudeau. He got rid of their carbon tax [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=655.4s)]
*  He basically cut the rate down to zero [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=662.1999999999999s)]
*  Carney also pledged to get rid of Trudeau's cap gains increases and I think Trudeau just being off the stage was absolutely critical for Carney [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=664.5600000000001s)]
*  Because he could provide he could project himself as a firm break from the previous iteration of the Liberal Party [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=672.76s)]
*  Even if it's a fourth consecutive Liberal Party term Carney's fave unfave numbers actually improved during the election [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=678.24s)]
*  Which is very surprising for someone who was kind of incumbent [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=684.4200000000001s)]
*  But you just don't often see that usually you just get worn down up here [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=687.6s)]
*  Probably I've ended it 40 fave 45 unfave then I saw this in one story that at an April rally a woman yelled [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=690.98s)]
*  Lead us big daddy at Mark Carney [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=697.7s)]
*  So that surprised me. I mean he does kind of exude a certain [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=700.94s)]
*  paternal big daddy like yeah [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=705.54s)]
*  Look in terms of what to expect. I mean in normal times, you know [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=708.1800000000001s)]
*  Mark Carney is your kind of you know hyper qualified globalist, right? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=713.34s)]
*  He's a man that despite we deal with the carbon tax has been focused on climate change and climate finance for a long time [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=719.3s)]
*  He's someone who's tried to navigate ways to minimize the negative impacts of globalization while you're not, you know [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=726.34s)]
*  Junking the whole system, but I think what's interesting that we'll also have to watch beyond just the backlash to trumpism [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=732.84s)]
*  Is you know, did he? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=739.46s)]
*  actually stumble into a formula here that is different and kind of interesting where [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=742.54s)]
*  You know, he's combining like a a certain form of competence and [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=747.4200000000001s)]
*  Nationalism I mean because there's a lot of nationalism what he says very much and it kind of the authenticity of a technocrat [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=755.34s)]
*  You know, like he comes across as a very authentic guy. Yeah, I actually watched a lot of these videos with him and [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=760.58s)]
*  But he's not authentically pretending to be someone else. He's not like going on, you know [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=767.34s)]
*  The O'Vaughn and trying to talk about pop culture [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=772.66s)]
*  He's authentic by talking about like banking and yeah, you know hockey which he clearly likes and and and so I don't know [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=775.94s)]
*  Maybe this is this is a different formula than we've seen, you know, he is who he is. It's appealing to people [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=783.22s)]
*  And it doesn't fit naturally in any [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=789.62s)]
*  It's hard to think of like what what campaign would you compare him to that? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=792.66s)]
*  We've seen in recent years like it it doesn't it's it's different than Keir Starmer [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=796.6600000000001s)]
*  Who's just kind of like we're gonna make things normal again [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=800.44s)]
*  like there's a there's a fight to Carney and obviously Trump gives him the foil but that [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=802.44s)]
*  Look, I'm not trying to raise expectations too high. He's not like some uber charismatic guy [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=807.2800000000001s)]
*  And what you're getting at is he was like the right political kind of the moment [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=811.32s)]
*  It was not just the Trump is starting to fucking annex them [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=815.44s)]
*  It was that we're threatening to destroy their economy and create a financial crisis via tariff and this guy's like, hey hand up [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=817.8000000000001s)]
*  I was a central banker in London in Canada. I'm your guy. I'm your guy friend of the pod and new Democratic Party leader [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=824.92s)]
*  Jugmeet Singh also lost his seat in a brutal night for the NDP his party [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=832.88s)]
*  We got a jug meat sing came on a couple years ago [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=838.36s)]
*  They think of them as like kind of the Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic Party [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=840.9599999999999s)]
*  But they went from winning 25 seats in 2021 to a projected seven seats Monday night [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=844.76s)]
*  which I think like lowers them below a certain threshold to be officially represented in Parliament and [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=850.16s)]
*  I think what ultimately what happened is the race just became this binary question over who can best stand up to Trump and [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=854.92s)]
*  smaller parties like the NDP [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=860.68s)]
*  Got squeezed out. I also saw some of the coverage that former congressman Pete Hoekstra is [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=863.16s)]
*  Just arrived yesterday to be US ambassador to Canada [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=870.4799999999999s)]
*  Which is just very funny because that went from like kind of a cushy [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=873.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, kind of a plum job for a real, you know kind of a you're gonna be fighting. Yeah [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=876.68s)]
*  Ottawa was up here in hostile territory [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=882.4s)]
*  Yeah, well we wish them the best we should just say we love our Canadian listeners and we're very glad that you have absolutely [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=886.1999999999999s)]
*  saying smart tough prime minister [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=891.92s)]
*  Again, not perfect but better than the alternative. Yeah better than alternative last thing [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=894.24s)]
*  I saw Ben that I thought you would interest you in particular [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=897.9599999999999s)]
*  The New York Times had an interesting piece a few weeks back about how meta had blocked actual news on [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=900.04s)]
*  The Facebook and Instagram feeds in Canada [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=906.12s)]
*  Because they do this back in 2023 because those assholes don't want to pay publishers for news [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=909.2800000000001s)]
*  It would have cost them an estimated 44 million dollars a year out of their [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=915.44s)]
*  164 billion dollars per year in revenue. So there's been this huge proliferation of [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=920.88s)]
*  right-wing accounts that posts kind of either agitprop or fake news all day long and I read about that they made me very nervous for [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=927.08s)]
*  What the impact might be on the election, obviously it ended okay, but it will likely be an issue going forward and it'll get worse [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=934.5200000000001s)]
*  I mean the thing is, you know [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=940.5600000000001s)]
*  Usually you're kind of at your high water political mark after you get elected right those accounts that right-wing machine in part because they sense [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=942.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah that this was a blow to the momentum of trumpism [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=949.9200000000001s)]
*  I think you're unfortunately gonna see an uptick in kind of right-wing garbage in Canada [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=953.1600000000001s)]
*  And in other places as well certainly Australia [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=958.5600000000001s)]
*  And and look it'll be interesting to see what the conservatives do in Canada because do they [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=961.5600000000001s)]
*  Out of fear that they're gonna be out of step with if their prime minister is standing up to Trump [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=967.2s)]
*  Do they want to be seen as attacking their prime minister, right? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=972.4000000000001s)]
*  Or did they follow the lead of the Republican Party in this country and they don't care and they just become [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=976.4000000000001s)]
*  You know nihilist and they're trashing him and they're lying about things and maybe they're not siding with Trump [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=982.32s)]
*  But they're they're just trying to tear Carney down. That's an interesting political choice of the conservatives because there's political danger in [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=987.7199999999999s)]
*  Attacking your prime minister when your country's under attack [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=995.64s)]
*  But they kind of have some of that, you know, like right-wing DNA that like leads you in those directions [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=998.52s)]
*  Yeah, big big choice for the conservative party about how to forge a path forward [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1003.52s)]
*  All right, Ben [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1007.0s)]
*  So a lot has happened since we last covered the war in Ukraine, but it's still not clear if any progress was actually made [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1007.68s)]
*  Yeah, you know like a lot of events a lot of Marco Rubio threats [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1013.18s)]
*  Will get to those pick up his toys and go in the other toy room is very sad [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1016.44s)]
*  So Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met in the Vatican this past weekend where they were attending the Pope's funeral [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1020.12s)]
*  Because of JD Vance as we mentioned last week [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1027.3600000000001s)]
*  Here's a clip of Trump talking about that conversation with Zelensky their first conversation since that [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1029.56s)]
*  Disastrous Oval Office meeting back in February and then also Trump comments on the peace talks generally we had a good meeting [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1035.44s)]
*  It was a nice meeting. It was a beautiful meeting [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1041.88s)]
*  It's the nicest the nicest office I've ever seen [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1044.0400000000002s)]
*  You know in about two weeks we're gonna see what happens I want to see what happens with respect to Russia [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1049.0800000000002s)]
*  Because Russia had been surprised and disappointed very disappointed that they did the bombing of those places [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1055.48s)]
*  after discussions [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1063.0800000000002s)]
*  Zelensky talked to you about Crimea [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1065.08s)]
*  Well, he did [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1067.8799999999999s)]
*  Very briefly, but Crimea was given away by Barack Hussein Obama and by Biden. That's 11 or 12 years ago [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1069.36s)]
*  That's a long time ago. I don't know how you can bring up Crimea go back to Obama ask them [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1076.6799999999998s)]
*  Why they gave it up they gave it up without a shot being fired by the way [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1081.32s)]
*  Well, I wanted to stop shooting sit down and sign a deal [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1089.36s)]
*  Very sober forward-looking [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1093.1599999999999s)]
*  Policy there from Trump [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1095.1599999999999s)]
*  So at the very end there he's referring to Russia's airstrikes on Keefe last week that killed 12 people and wounded over 90 [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1096.24s)]
*  That Russian attack came just after the US had proposed a deal that would recognize Crimea as Russian territory [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1102.28s)]
*  freeze the war on current lines and [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1107.36s)]
*  De facto recognized Russian control over major portions of the four provinces in eastern Ukraine about 20% of their territory [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1109.8s)]
*  Give a commitment that Ukraine will never join NATO and lift sanctions on Russia [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1116.08s)]
*  So basically Putin's entire wish list was offered up and he is still firing shots. Yeah [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1120.52s)]
*  Even though Trump's real estate buddy turned adversary Steve Wittkopf has been doing the actual meetings with Putin [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1126.0800000000002s)]
*  I think we're up to four at this point. I think usually one-on-one usually with no actual professional staff [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1131.8400000000001s)]
*  Secretary of Sunday shows Marco Rubio went on meet the press this weekend to announce that this is a critical week for the talks [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1137.2s)]
*  Here's a clip of Rubio [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1143.54s)]
*  This week is gonna be a really important week in which we have to make a determination [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1144.76s)]
*  About whether this is an endeavor that we want to continue to be involved in or if it's time to sort of focus on some [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1148.3999999999999s)]
*  Other issues that are equally if not more important in some cases, but we want to see it happen [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1154.6399999999999s)]
*  There are reasons to be optimistic, but there are reasons to be realistic. Of course as well [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1159.52s)]
*  We're close, but we're not close enough inspiring Putin's latest demand is a three-day ceasefire from May 8th to the 11th [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1163.84s)]
*  So that this pesky little war he started doesn't interrupt Russia's World War two Victory Day celebrations [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1170.1999999999998s)]
*  So Ben, this is obviously a terrible deal for Ukraine what Trump has proposed German defense minister [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1175.52s)]
*  Boris Pistorius described it as one that quote Ukraine on its own could have gotten a year ago [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1182.1599999999999s)]
*  It is akin to a capitulation. I cannot discern any added value [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1187.04s)]
*  There were some recent reporting by Christopher Miller friend of the pod about how Ukrainians are very worried that Trump is gonna walk away from [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1190.6399999999999s)]
*  These talks but I guess I remain confused at how that would be much worse for Zelensky [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1197.08s)]
*  If the Europeans actually stepped up to support him, but I don't know what did you make of just this latest round of back-and-forth [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1202.6s)]
*  Secretary of shame [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1209.4399999999998s)]
*  Marco Rubio [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1210.84s)]
*  You know, first of all these incessant threats because he said the same thing like two or three weeks ago. Yeah, right [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1212.7199999999998s)]
*  Like I mean we're making fun of him, but it really is that bad for your credibility [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1219.76s)]
*  You know seriously to just like keep threatening to walk away from a table that you keep sitting at, you know [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1223.9199999999998s)]
*  Because then people your boss sits at yeah [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1229.4s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. I mean fair point [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1231.88s)]
*  Maybe he doesn't know but I mean this seriously like you can't this is what this performative nonsense [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1234.7s)]
*  You know speaks to the the bigger problem with their policy, which is that they the reality doesn't exist [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1240.4s)]
*  Like it exists for them on Fox News [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1246.96s)]
*  Like in reality, you can't just make the war in Ukraine stop so that you can look good on television, right? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1249.0s)]
*  Which is what Trump seems to be interested in Putin if you're giving him everything he wants at the negotiating table [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1255.24s)]
*  Of course, he's gonna keep like pushing farther and waiting to see if you'll give him more [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1260.88s)]
*  You know, that's not a mystery to anyone when when Trump says he's surprised that Russia's still bombing Ukraine [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1265.32s)]
*  Why is he surprised anybody who knows anything about Putin? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1272.2s)]
*  You know, so that's the first point the second one. I found it interesting Tommy that Trump felt the need [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1275.3600000000001s)]
*  To have this visible meeting with Zelensky [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1281.82s)]
*  They released those photos the White House did they wanted people to see him sitting with Zelensky in serious conversation [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1284.9s)]
*  And then he came out and said, you know the nicest things he possibly could he still doesn't really compliment [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1291.18s)]
*  Zelensky the Ukrainians, but he kind of indicated was good meeting to me. It showed that both Trump and Zelensky [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1296.9s)]
*  Needed the appearance of that meeting for their own politics now Zelensky [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1303.8600000000001s)]
*  Obvious why like, you know, they're worried not just about the American negotiating position [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1309.04s)]
*  They're worried that America will walk away from the table and that America will pull [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1313.66s)]
*  Military and intelligence support and so Zelensky needs to be seen to at least be trying to maintain that American relationship [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1317.88s)]
*  I think it showed real vulnerability for Trump that he felt the need to have that meeting and say those things [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1324.8s)]
*  Because I don't think he's just doing that because he decided to wake up one day and be pissed at Putin [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1330.52s)]
*  He's known who Putin was all along. I think he's getting shit [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1335.2s)]
*  From look the polls is an 80-20 issue in this country. I think Republicans in Congress [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1339.0s)]
*  This is the first issue where they've been willing to really criticize themselves on some of them [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1343.64s)]
*  Yeah, you see you come out and criticize the policy. He's gonna need their votes and other stuff [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1348.0s)]
*  Yeah, other world leaders Europeans are not but like the Germans are not budging. They're saying this is bullshit [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1351.56s)]
*  This is a shitty deal and that's part of what's frustrating secretary of shame Rubio [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1356.52s)]
*  It's because he goes to the meeting with the Europeans and they they tell him that and so even Trump [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1359.98s)]
*  You know to me it's a sign don't let up stand up to this guy's keep standing up to the bully and [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1364.96s)]
*  The bully will have to move in your direction, you know [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1370.76s)]
*  now in terms of the chances for ending the war I were no closer today than we were a week ago because [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1374.24s)]
*  the Russians are in Transigen Putin's in Transigen and the last Trump is actually willing to go beyond just like truth thing about it to [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1381.72s)]
*  Like applying some additional pressure or taking some Ukrainian [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1388.2800000000002s)]
*  I mean the Crimea point is is perfect. I mean, first of all, obviously we didn't give [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1392.8799999999999s)]
*  Cronin Barack Obama and own Crimea and give it to somebody but frankly we never recognize the annexation of Crimea not [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1397.48s)]
*  Obama not Trump in his first term not Biden and so what gets he was president Trump [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1404.76s)]
*  Recognizing the annexation of Crimea which is what's being discussed is a huge shift in US policy that he doesn't need to give [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1410.6799999999998s)]
*  You know what if you're frustrated with what Putin's doing rescind that effort at the negotiating table [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1416.62s)]
*  You know what Putin like, you know, you had your chance you fucked it up and now we're taking this back off the table [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1421.48s)]
*  Yeah, like you have to do things that incentivize Russia to change behavior [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1426.6000000000001s)]
*  Trump views this through such a petty personal lens. He did this long interview with Time magazine [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1430.48s)]
*  They asked him is there anything that Putin could do that would cause you to say you know what? [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1435.4s)]
*  I'm on Zelensky side now and his response was not necessarily on Zelensky side, but on Ukraine side. Yes [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1439.28s)]
*  Yeah, but not necessarily on Zelensky side. I've had a hard time with Zelensky [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1444.98s)]
*  Get over it you whiny bitch the man is defending his country also in that same interview [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1448.76s)]
*  He was asked you said you dead in the war in Ukraine on day one Trump goes [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1452.76s)]
*  Well, I said that figuratively I said that as an exaggeration [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1456.6399999999999s)]
*  Obviously people know when I said that it was said in jest because of course we all [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1459.32s)]
*  Joke about a conflict that you yourself said could lead to World War three or was World War three [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1462.96s)]
*  but to your point about like how how [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1468.44s)]
*  pathetic Trump looks I mean Trump's initial response to [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1471.52s)]
*  The horrific airstrikes on Keefe was to truth social Vladimir comma stop exclamation point [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1475.44s)]
*  Shocked that one didn't work. Yeah. Yeah, I mean that that's the thing [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1482.52s)]
*  It's a man that there's something dangerous [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1485.66s)]
*  And if you study like these autocrats to about someone whose feedback loop is constantly sycophantic and positive [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1488.04s)]
*  Because the feedback loop from the world is not like that [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1494.84s)]
*  And and and you can truth that and people in the Republican Party say yes, sir. Yes, sir [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1497.4s)]
*  But Vladimir Putin's not gonna do that, you know [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1502.42s)]
*  And and I like to just bring some more into it and listen to the interview with Alexandra [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1504.66s)]
*  There are other things that the US could be bringing this negotiation that you know [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1508.9s)]
*  International justice like are there gonna be efforts to hold Russia accountable? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1512.5400000000002s)]
*  For the rest of these people's lives for what they've done to Ukrainians. What what about the 20,000 children? [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1517.42s)]
*  What about the kids like yeah, what are we doing to insist on those children being returned right? There are different [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1522.8600000000001s)]
*  Sometimes when a negotiation is tilted in one side's favor part of what you have to do is enlarge the universe of things being discussed [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1530.06s)]
*  Trump is only discussing things that Putin wants to talk about, you know annexation of that 20% of Ukraine's territory [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1536.7s)]
*  Ukraine's membership in NATO, you know, these are its actions list [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1543.02s)]
*  Yeah [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1546.74s)]
*  There's a Ukrainian list that has things like the 20,000 children has things like war crimes that has things like what happens to sanctions [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1546.98s)]
*  What happens to the frozen reserves? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1553.62s)]
*  There's like the hundreds of billions of dollars and and frozen Russian reserves that they went back that the Europeans might want to use to support [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1555.0600000000002s)]
*  Ukraine America could say, you know [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1561.7800000000002s)]
*  We're gonna work with the Europeans to get this money the Ukrainians if you don't deal so there there are there are using no leverage [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1563.66s)]
*  He's making vague threats of slapping the same sanctions back on Putin. That's right [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1569.5800000000002s)]
*  Who is not worried about don't listen to JD Vance saying that somehow we have no levers to pull here other than like somehow going [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1573.42s)]
*  To war ourselves. There are other things we could do. Yeah a couple of other quick things been so North Korea publicly acknowledged [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1579.18s)]
*  For the first time that they had sent troops to Russia to fight against Ukraine [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1584.82s)]
*  Kim Jong-un announced that they would build a monument to their heroism [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1587.82s)]
*  So I'm sure that the families of the estimated 4,000 North Korean troops who have been killed or wounded feel great about that [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1591.58s)]
*  Western intelligence officials believe that North Korea sent about 14,000 troops total to fight in the Kursk region of Russia [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1597.8999999999999s)]
*  That was that part of Russia that the the Ukrainians invaded and briefly occupied [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1604.6599999999999s)]
*  It does sound like the combined Russian North Korean forces have driven Ukrainian troops out of Russian territory [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1609.86s)]
*  So they've lost that as a bargaining chip [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1616.54s)]
*  So that's 4,000 people killed or wounded out of 14,000 total troops to fight in Kursk. It's pretty high casualty rate [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1619.02s)]
*  Also, there was this report of a high-ranking Russian general who was killed in an explosion outside of Moscow last week [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1624.7s)]
*  Right when Wiccaff was about to land actually in Russia for his meeting with Putin [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1630.5s)]
*  I guess that he walked by a car that had been rigged with an IED [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1633.76s)]
*  Russia called it a terrorist attack that was conducted by the Ukrainians [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1636.86s)]
*  The Ukrainians refused to comment on these things as sort of a general policy, but it would match up with past [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1641.3799999999999s)]
*  Actions by their special services. So the war very much still going. Yeah [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1647.3799999999999s)]
*  No, and I was just like the 4,000 number to put that in context. That's more than the number of Americans that died in Afghanistan [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1652.02s)]
*  Yeah, you know [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1657.18s)]
*  Well that that was I think that was killed and wounded just killed and wounded. Okay. Well, but either way [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1658.5s)]
*  I mean it suggests that the Russians are treating the North Koreans like cannon fodder, which is how they often treat their own troops, you know [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1663.26s)]
*  and and you know, we'll see whether [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1671.34s)]
*  You know over time this is a military alliance that sustains itself or whether this was kind of a one-off in Kursk [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1675.1s)]
*  But I mean this is this kind of globalization of the war in Ukraine is something we have to continue to watch because we've seen these Chinese [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1680.62s)]
*  You know reports of Chinese, you know [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1686.98s)]
*  Personnel of some sort being in you. Yeah, what do you make of this? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1689.74s)]
*  I don't think we ever talked about that on the show [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1692.94s)]
*  I mean there are some reports or some suggestions in some of the reporting that maybe they were more like Intel officers [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1694.3s)]
*  Yeah, so the they were a handful of Chinese including some they were captured by the Ukrainians [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1699.32s)]
*  So we know this this happened the Chinese kind of denied the Chinese government that they were somehow involved [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1704.3s)]
*  I don't believe that you have Chinese people ending up on the front lines in Ukraine without the Chinese Communist Party that has kind [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1709.4s)]
*  Of total control over things. Yeah, at least being aware of it [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1715.9s)]
*  I don't know [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1718.66s)]
*  I mean one speculation that I've heard that's interesting is that that they are like Intel officers that they're learning things that they're learning [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1719.74s)]
*  They want to learn from what's happening in this conflict [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1725.8200000000002s)]
*  They want to learn about the ways that things are the way it's being fought [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1728.7s)]
*  They want to learn about different weapon systems and that's certainly possible too. And we've seen this I mean not to you know, not to use a [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1731.46s)]
*  Historical analogy, it's a little troubling but like Spanish Civil War vibes, right? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1739.26s)]
*  We're like different parties start to creep in to see what it's like modern warfare [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1743.1000000000001s)]
*  Anticipating some future war, you know now, let's hope that doesn't happen [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1748.32s)]
*  But the war in Ukraine the longer it goes on we've seen different actors, you know, we look there have been Americans there, too [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1751.9199999999998s)]
*  Including this really weird story about the son [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1757.84s)]
*  Of a deputy director at the CIA killed in Eastern Ukraine in 2024 fighting under contract for the Russian military [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1761.3999999999999s)]
*  Very strange story. I don't know what to make it. It's an incredible story [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1769.52s)]
*  People should check it out essentially this kid went on a journey of sorts and Michael Alexander [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1772.84s)]
*  Yeah, totally by his own choice when and fought and died for the Russians [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1777.6s)]
*  I've never seen anything like that. I mean very senior CIA official [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1783.56s)]
*  So, I don't know deputy director for digital innovation at the CIA. That's a very important job [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1788.32s)]
*  Yeah, yeah and one that the Russians would be interested in so I don't know [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1795.36s)]
*  But yeah tragic obviously horrible tragic [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1799.58s)]
*  That point but raises the bunch of questions. Yeah a lot of questions. Okay, we're gonna take a quick break [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1803.1799999999998s)]

*  What are the implications for American security? So it's a real step-back conversation [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1878.6s)]
*  Very much supplements what we talk about but it kind of let's step back and look at the big picture [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1883.56s)]
*  Stacey's very good at making us think about what does this mean for all of us? What should we do about it? [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1888.24s)]

*  It's not standing but it just basically it's over the weekend and Sunday afternoon [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1975.76s)]
*  It's usually if it's if she calls me something it's bad. I failed. Yeah. Yeah, that's good [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1980.2s)]
*  Well, you can give her that call on Sunday. You can also give her an aura digital picture frame [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=1984.8799999999999s)]

*  So we're all a little too far away [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2026.2s)]
*  I think an aura frame is a great way to stay in touch to upload the newest photos of a pet or your kids or [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2027.5600000000002s)]

*  Okay, Ben so like we said at the top somehow this story about Pete Hegseth our [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2071.74s)]
*  Leader with the Department of Defense is still going dear leader. Yeah dear leader last week [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2076.2599999999998s)]
*  We dug into all these details about top eight to Hegseth who are accused of leaking and fired this week [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2080.54s)]
*  We're talking about it again because half of these dudes keep doing interviews [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2086.82s)]
*  So the first one was Joe Casper who was Hegseth chief of staff [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2090.62s)]
*  He did an interview with Ryan Grim at Dropsight News interesting choice. Oh, yeah, like I [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2093.7s)]
*  Was done an interview with Ryan Grim [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2098.78s)]
*  Ryan in Dropsight there are hardly fans of the Trump administration like it's hard to think of people less [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2101.7000000000003s)]
*  Ideologically aligned with Pete Hegseth than Ryan. So just bizarre in this interview Casper talks about like a possible [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2107.2200000000003s)]
*  Investigation into whether he was doing drugs [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2115.38s)]
*  He floats his crazy theory about the leaks and that it was all a setup like it's very paranoid very weird and then Colin Carroll [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2117.7000000000003s)]
*  Who was chief of staff to the deputy secretary of defense Steve Heimberg did an interview with Megyn Kelly on her podcast [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2125.22s)]
*  Let's listen to a clip of that. I keep you look at a pie chart of the secretary's day at this point [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2131.42s)]
*  50% of it's probably leak investigation press like it's that like that can't be that's a bad thing for [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2136.8599999999997s)]
*  America's bad thing for the president's objectives [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2143.2999999999997s)]
*  And then in order to kind of combat an image [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2145.8199999999997s)]
*  It's hey, we're gonna go do work out the troops [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2149.22s)]
*  While that is important and it's a thing to do and get out there because it helps with recruiting [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2152.1s)]
*  It just helps like with morale [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2156.5s)]
*  You know if you're taking a half-day trip to the Naval Academy at the same time [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2159.3399999999997s)]
*  The budget is due and we really need some support here [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2162.14s)]
*  Like come on, you gotta weigh priorities my observation from the first 90 days and this is gonna sound weird is that [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2164.5s)]
*  We had less of a problem from like the deep state bureaucrats in the department [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2172.3399999999997s)]
*  Then we did from maybe some people on our own team they're polygraphing people actively right now in the department [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2178.02s)]
*  There's just like a culture fear. It's people that are like political people, you know [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2184.42s)]
*  They're on the team and no one's gonna want to come in that environment [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2188.26s)]
*  so if you've created that environment, you're basically it's like a self-fulfilling prophecy now or [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2191.94s)]
*  People are just gonna leave no one wants to deal with that and then your your team gets smaller and smaller and smaller [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2197.7400000000002s)]
*  You can't run a three million person organization by kind of like having a cabal of five people and making decisions [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2202.4s)]
*  It's like shock any memos out. That's not how it's how [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2208.44s)]
*  change actually happens [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2211.88s)]
*  and [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2213.92s)]
*  So I I don't think that we ever we struggled as an administration really put a functioning team together [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2215.08s)]
*  Oh damning stuff. I first of all no shit. It wasn't the career professional people leaking [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2220.0s)]
*  It was the political people because we all watched Trump 1.0 [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2225.28s)]
*  But like we know it's your friends who are doing all the leaking also Ben if it's true that the Secretary of Defense [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2228.36s)]
*  Is spending half of his day on leak investigations that is that is scary. That's a huge problem [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2233.2400000000002s)]
*  That's a horrible use of his time and it's worth noting that in addition to the signal gate stories that we've covered about Hegseth [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2238.6800000000003s)]
*  Sharing all this classified information in a commercially available app to people without a clearance [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2244.28s)]
*  This German site your Spiegel did an investigation into how easy it was to find personal contact info for Hegseth his email [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2248.44s)]
*  a [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2255.98s)]
*  password for one of his email accounts on like hacked leaked forums and [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2256.7000000000003s)]
*  It was him. It was Tulsi Gabbard as a bunch of other top administration officials [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2261.54s)]
*  So like this problem of their information security is far more serious than just [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2265.9s)]
*  Texting Jeffrey Goldberg by accident. Yeah, first of all shout out to our team for that supercut [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2271.7400000000002s)]
*  It just captures things are beautifully the essence of and it is like a guy wakes in the middle of night [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2276.66s)]
*  I woke up in the middle of night and and I opened the window and it was it was it was dark outside [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2280.98s)]
*  You know like these are so obvious these things are so obvious [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2285.82s)]
*  But the thing that is striking to me Tommy's I've wondered something ever since this particular nutty [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2289.94s)]
*  Nihilistic brand of the Republican Party really started mushrooming the Obama years [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2297.82s)]
*  I would always wonder like do these people actually believe these things or are they pretending to believe these things right and part of what? [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2301.02s)]
*  You hear in that interview is that like someone who believes these genuine surprise being like I showed up the Pentagon and it wasn't [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2307.34s)]
*  full of a bunch of deep state, you know operatives out to get us and and and then similarly [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2313.3s)]
*  Shocked to be like this fundamentally unserious person [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2319.1800000000003s)]
*  It was put in charge of the Pentagon wasn't prepared to do anything other than manage his own image and go work out with the troops [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2322.1800000000003s)]
*  You know like well, of course no shit, but so he is like that's like like what about Pete Hegseth? [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2326.86s)]
*  if has ever suggested to you that he wanted to dig into the details of the Pentagon budget or [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2332.1000000000004s)]
*  Think about like how to you know deal with strategy in a disintegrating world order [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2336.7s)]
*  This is a man who as long as he's at the Pentagon is gonna spend half of his day [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2341.18s)]
*  Staring in the fucking mirror cuz like that's all he's really interested in doing in the first place [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2345.58s)]
*  You know, he did put in a makeup studio. It sounds like yeah, he's a usually likes to be drunk and [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2349.5s)]
*  And he was a thing [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2354.2999999999997s)]
*  There's such a trivial ization of American politics and frankly like I think there's a sense out in the normie world [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2355.62s)]
*  That some of the resistance [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2362.8999999999996s)]
*  People are kind of cried wolf people but but actually these things are some of these things are very real [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2365.7400000000002s)]
*  No, it matters the fact that Pete Hegseth does shit on his private phone and his phone number could be fined by dear [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2372.06s)]
*  Spiegel is like a sign that the Chinese and the Russians and other people are in his phone and are seeing all this crap [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2377.7000000000003s)]
*  You know hard this is not something that people are only saying on [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2383.42s)]
*  MSNBC resistance Twitter like this is something that is happening again in the real world and [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2387.1s)]
*  The entire Trump presidency is gonna be this kind of dynamic of [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2392.42s)]
*  People who are living in an alternative reality being forced to exist in actual reality [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2397.3s)]
*  Yeah [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2401.42s)]
*  I mean being an opposition is easy governing is very hard Colin Carroll in this interview also says that what Hegseth [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2401.94s)]
*  Shared in that signal chat was classified. He makes the point that Pete could have just been like I have declassification authority [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2407.26s)]
*  Therefore it's okay to share it but it's a bit of an end run around the process is supposed to work [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2413.5s)]
*  He's not wrong although there Trump was asked about all this here's his quote about this for a vote of confidence [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2418.16s)]
*  I think he's gonna get it together. I had to talk with him a positive talk, but I had to talk with him [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2423.0s)]
*  Also been like one of the leaks that apparently [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2428.2s)]
*  Flipped Pete out was this time story about this plan to brief Elon Musk on these top-secret [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2431.64s)]
*  US war plans with China [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2437.72s)]
*  So there's been a lot more reporting on what was in the memo that was gonna get shared with Elon [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2439.24s)]
*  But luckily wasn't according to the Wall Street Journal [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2443.52s)]
*  The briefing was supposed to include information on 29 China related special access programs [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2446.24s)]
*  So the most sensitive stuff the Pentagon does like we're probably talking about [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2452.0s)]
*  unknown [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2456.48s)]
*  at least to the [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2457.72s)]
*  General population like sensitive technologies and weapons that are specifically designed for war with China [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2459.56s)]
*  Which is one insane and also like more evidence that Trump and Hegseth denials that this briefing was ever gonna happen [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2465.44s)]
*  Were a lie [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2473.1s)]
*  We also learned by the way that Elon sat in on Trump's interview with an Air Force secretary nominee pretty weird for a defense contractor [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2474.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean here's like what's weird to me about this first of all, you know for [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2480.5s)]
*  Most of eight years I was deputy national security advisor level [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2486.14s)]
*  Got the presidential daily briefing was in the morning briefing with Obama the whole second term. I was never [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2490.1s)]
*  read into those types of things [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2497.14s)]
*  Not cuz I was like you weren't you weren't gonna be like a 180 day [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2500.06s)]
*  I didn't need to know I'm making a joke. No, I know I know I know I know I know you make that joke [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2506.74s)]
*  But I'm saying is like I I had no need to know about some super secret technology that we might use in a war with [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2511.14s)]
*  China to carry out my duties, right? Like why on earth? I mean, yeah, no, this is your point like why on earth this contractor? [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2517.3799999999997s)]
*  Needed to know these things is really fucking suspicious and scary because all I can think of is [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2526.1000000000004s)]
*  One, you know, I don't know gives him a leg up and his contracting business with the Pentagon [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2533.42s)]
*  That's the most likely scenario anything anything you can learn they can help his SpaceX business or whatever a procurement thing [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2539.0600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, too. I don't know. Maybe he wants to tell somebody about it. Like that's even scarier [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2545.0200000000004s)]
*  What are you I wonder if you requested it or if this was Pete's like where did this idea come from? [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2549.34s)]
*  It also shows how much they're in this kind of psychic grip of Elon that the P-tex sitting there thinking about like, you know [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2553.58s)]
*  Do I you know like like what is this person? [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2559.18s)]
*  Like this is not a person that should exist in the US government structure, you know [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2562.14s)]
*  And and and the Air Force General same thing like this person [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2565.7999999999997s)]
*  Presumably might have some say over acquisition [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2570.94s)]
*  I mean absolutely this acquisitions for systems that include Elan's like the scale of corruption here is just a mind-boggling [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2573.56s)]
*  That Air Force secretary at some point will likely have to decide. Okay, do we go with Boeing? [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2579.38s)]
*  Or SpaceX for this contract exactly and that's what I think in on your fucking job interview [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2583.58s)]
*  Yeah, crazy [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2588.7799999999997s)]
*  And that's what I think is about and I should say by the way [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2589.74s)]
*  Like this is by no means the biggest fucking whole wealth to dig out of [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2591.8199999999997s)]
*  But you know [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2596.2599999999998s)]
*  The next president is gonna inherit a Pentagon that is probably gonna be wired on [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2597.06s)]
*  Grok and SpaceX and all this crap and by the chain we have to like be going through like the howl computer in 2001 [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2600.74s)]
*  Just unplugging this shit, you know [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2607.5s)]
*  also [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2609.62s)]
*  Did you see that an aircraft carrier in the Red Sea accidentally dumped a 67 million dollar [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2610.74s)]
*  FAA 18 super Hornet fighter jet into the ocean [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2616.74s)]
*  I guess I did they were towing it from the hangar bay [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2619.18s)]
*  It sounds like the boat was turning to reposition itself to deal with who theme this whole [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2622.4599999999996s)]
*  There were some questions about whether or not the reason it was turning like that might have been because of the way the Houthis were [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2627.8199999999997s)]
*  Firing stuff at them which shows that the longer you're at war with the Houthis like you start to lose planes [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2634.06s)]
*  Like yeah, you start to have accidents [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2638.9s)]
*  I mean the idea that you can have a cost-free forever war which is what they seem to think [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2640.7000000000003s)]
*  Cuts against all the experience of the forever wars. Yeah, I won one person was injured. No one was killed. Thank God [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2645.06s)]
*  But it's not good to dump a 67 million dollar plane at the ocean [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2651.98s)]
*  Also that same ship the USS Harry Truman collided with a merchant ship back in February [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2655.02s)]
*  The commander of the time was relieved but to your point, I mean these things are [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2660.06s)]
*  Very dangerous [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2664.6s)]
*  Alright Ben, so last Tuesday [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2665.7999999999997s)]
*  There was a horrific terrorist attack in the India controlled part of the Kashmir [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2668.4s)]
*  That is drastically ratchet up tensions between India and Pakistan that we wanted to talk about that attack [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2673.08s)]
*  By the way happened right as JD Vance was visiting India [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2678.64s)]
*  giving foreign leaders yet another reason to want him to just kind of stay away for a little bow as a [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2682.48s)]
*  You don't want that guy around. No, you don't want that. He's bad news [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2688.2799999999997s)]
*  So the gunman killed 26 people all but one of them Indian tourists they reportedly I saw a report [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2690.6s)]
*  I don't know if this has been confirmed that they were separating out the terrorists were separating out non-muslims and then executing them [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2695.52s)]
*  This happened in a mountain valley area. That's a tourist destination because it's very beautiful [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2700.52s)]
*  Initially there were reports that an obscure group called the Kashmir resistance front was responsible for the attacks [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2705.0s)]
*  India says they have ties to a Pakistani terrorist organization. The resistance front is now denying responsibilities saying its social media was hacked [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2711.44s)]
*  So this is all very weird [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2717.98s)]
*  Regardless the Indian government is pointing the finger at Pakistan and pledging brutal retaliation [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2719.26s)]
*  Prime Minister Modi said quote India will identify track and punish every terrorist and their backers [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2723.58s)]
*  We will we will pursue them to the ends of the earth. So that's pretty intense [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2728.62s)]
*  Pakistan is denied responsibility. So Ben we can dig more into the history in a bit, but listeners should know that [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2733.1s)]
*  potential war between [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2739.86s)]
*  Nuclear-armed India and nuclear-armed Pakistan has been at the top of the World War Watch list for a very long time [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2741.18s)]
*  And now there's this escalating kind of diplomatic back and forth. So after this attack [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2748.8199999999997s)]
*  India revoked visas for Pakistani nationals. They reduced diplomatic staff in Pakistan [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2753.98s)]
*  They suspended a very important water sharing agreement between the two countries that has been in place since 1960 and in response [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2758.5s)]
*  Pakistan kicked India out of its airspace. They suspended trade with India [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2765.62s)]
*  Pakistan's defense minister told Reuters this week that he expects a military incursion from India at some point [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2769.42s)]
*  So, you know very scary stuff. What's your level of anxiety about the escalation ladder happening here? [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2775.54s)]
*  I mean, it's it's high because you feel like there's going to be an Indian response [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2782.42s)]
*  And you also feel like the international environment around this conflict is not one of mediation and de-escalation [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2788.2599999999998s)]
*  this is kind of [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2795.02s)]
*  The normalization of escalation whether it's in Ukraine where it's in the Middle East like I worry about how that [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2796.7s)]
*  Mentality enters into this conflict in the past what you've had is kind of calibrated responses like India takes some shot in Pakistan [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2802.62s)]
*  Right Pakistan does something back that is you know, they shoot at something and intentionally miss it kind of thing [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2809.54s)]
*  You know, and then everybody calms down that may happen [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2815.0s)]
*  but the risk here is if you know if things are escalating and [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2817.74s)]
*  Neither side blinks and it keeps escalating. Yes. These are two nuclear-armed nations that have fought multiple wars over this territory [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2822.58s)]
*  there's an absence of of an UN system or United States or any other kind of [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2828.66s)]
*  mediator that could come in to try to calm things down [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2834.5s)]
*  and so I think we have to be quite concerned about it because [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2837.34s)]
*  We you know [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2842.7s)]
*  we already have flashpoints in Ukraine in [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2843.58s)]
*  Iran and the Middle East right now and then Taiwan's looming there and now this enters into that picture too [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2846.3s)]
*  It's not the best [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2851.38s)]
*  Time for this to be happening. No, it's pretty scary time. Yeah, I mean just to get to some of the histories this dates back [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2853.62s)]
*  the modern sort of dispute over this territory dates back to [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2858.98s)]
*  The partition of the Indian subcontinent by the British in 1947 not a thousand years ago [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2862.94s)]
*  No, well, let's listen to President Trump's lesson because I think that's it's all we really need. Yes to hear him [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2867.62s)]
*  Kashmir has been going on for a thousand years probably longer than that [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2881.02s)]
*  Again, so that's not true [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2885.5s)]
*  Partition was in 1947 [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2888.58s)]
*  Since 1972 the Pakistani and Indian control parts of Kashmir have been separated by what's called the line of control [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2890.78s)]
*  The India administration portion has been dealing with a separatist insurgency for decades to make things even more complicated [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2897.86s)]
*  China also claims and controls a portion of Kashmir [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2904.58s)]
*  For most of this period the Indian administered Kashmir had a special autonomous status [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2907.86s)]
*  But Modi revoked that status in 2019 bringing the region directly under his control [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2913.58s)]
*  Since then the Indian government has cracked down a free speech on journalism. They've arrested thousands of people [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2919.42s)]
*  while at the same time encouraging people to [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2925.2200000000003s)]
*  Go to the region for vacations for tourism. So Trump was just like [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2927.9s)]
*  950 years off there. I think you have to be careful [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2933.58s)]
*  In his in his sort of knowledge, but he also repeated it too [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2937.86s)]
*  So it wasn't like a slip like he thought he'd made a really smart point. You nailed him. I really nailed it [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2940.42s)]
*  Yeah, I mean look this you've seen Modi kind of steadily change the status the status quo in Kashmir have been disputed territory [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2945.1800000000003s)]
*  and kind of frozen conflict and [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2954.02s)]
*  This they're supposed to be like international basis for there to be self-determination there [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2956.98s)]
*  But but Modi short-circuited that by essentially trying to absorb Kashmir. It's [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2961.7000000000003s)]
*  you know a tragic inevitability that [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2967.86s)]
*  You know, it's some like other places we talked about around the world including one more about talk about it [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2971.42s)]
*  but if you repress people and [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2975.58s)]
*  you know you you and [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2977.86s)]
*  All reports are and there's not a lot of reporting out of Kashmir too [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2980.1s)]
*  By the way, because they don't let a lot of independent journalism happen there [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2982.9s)]
*  is it's a pretty can be a pretty brutal environment you get occasional acts of violent resistance and [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2985.7000000000003s)]
*  And there's this cycle of that happening in India responding by attacking Pakistan and look [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2991.38s)]
*  I think the Pakistani government has tolerated [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2997.02s)]
*  In some cases supported groups that have a genus in Kashmir [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=2999.5s)]
*  I find it hard to believe that the Pakistani government like directed this attack, you know [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3003.2599999999998s)]
*  So I'm not sure it's constructive for India. I understand how Indians feel. Oh, yeah, and the anger they want a response [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3007.82s)]
*  I'm just not sure that attacking kind of the country of Pakistan is the most constructive way of doing that [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3014.54s)]
*  You're the stronger party [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3020.54s)]
*  India is indisputably the stronger party the bigger stronger country with the bigger economy and the bigger military and [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3021.98s)]
*  Actually, I think showing some restraint might actually be an India's interest in the medium and long term here [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3028.54s)]
*  Even if a lot of the short-term [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3033.3s)]
*  kind of [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3035.02s)]
*  Vengeance is is leading them to military action. Yeah, that's exactly right [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3036.26s)]
*  I mean there's a desire at least in the region for some sort of vengeance, especially given it's just like, you know [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3039.94s)]
*  26 purely civilian targets who are who are executed. Yeah, Modi Prime Minister Modi [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3044.82s)]
*  It's kind of like Netanyahu and then he portrays himself as a mister security [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3051.22s)]
*  Yeah, so clearly the tough talk that I read out earlier as you know part of him trying to [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3055.34s)]
*  You know respond to a black eye over this incident [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3061.06s)]
*  Well, and and this watch and actually the other thing you worry about it [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3064.18s)]
*  Sometimes Modi directs at it internally at the Muslim Muslim minority population within India. And so you hope you don't see that either [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3066.54s)]
*  Yeah, well actually let's turn to Netanyahu. So we had a couple Gaza updates we want to do [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3072.66s)]
*  So the first one is just according to like everybody on the ground [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3077.02s)]
*  things are [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3080.7s)]
*  Really bad in Gaza, maybe as bad as they've ever been right now [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3082.7s)]
*  The ceasefire, you know ended on the 18th and March 18th when the Israelis started bombing again [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3086.3399999999997s)]
*  Gaza has now been under a total Israeli blockade for about two months. The World Food Program said they are out of food stocks [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3092.74s)]
*  Gaza's few remaining medical facilities are nearly out of supplies and [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3099.22s)]
*  At the same time IDF airstrikes are back to being like daily occurrence [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3102.7799999999997s)]
*  The casualties are way up in some cases like dozens of people per day [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3107.24s)]
*  There's reports that 1600 people have been killed by Israeli airstrikes since the ceasefire ended [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3110.48s)]
*  The strikes are often on tents or other temporary structures for displaced people [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3114.8799999999997s)]
*  So there's tons of collateral damage the Israeli forces there have issued dozens of [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3118.8199999999997s)]
*  Conflicting evacuation orders. So people are just getting pushed all over the country according to Reuters [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3124.3399999999997s)]
*  Hamas is offered to release all remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for an end to the war [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3129.6s)]
*  Reconstruction of Gaza and the release of Palestinian prisoners being held by Israel [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3135.34s)]
*  But Hamas the counteroffer from the Israelis is reportedly a demand that they fully disarm as part of any deal [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3138.8199999999997s)]
*  Which has ended up being a non-starter for them [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3145.38s)]
*  So then I feel like things have been so insane in the Trump era that we have not covered Gaza as frequently as we did [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3147.72s)]
*  During the first year and a half of the war [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3154.7s)]
*  But it did seem important to highlight just how bad conditions are on the ground and the fact that the parties just seemed like [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3156.7s)]
*  They're nowhere close to any kind of ceasefire deal [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3161.62s)]
*  Yeah, but let's look I just think that this is because Israel is my own the war and now it is not when in the war [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3164.2400000000002s)]
*  be specific because if they were willing to in the war they would get the hostages out and [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3170.32s)]
*  And and and the idea that they somehow need to continue to fight a war against Hamas and Gaza [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3174.84s)]
*  I'm sorry. There's no security. There's no security need to do it [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3181.12s)]
*  There's it's a it's a literal impossibility that October 7th or anything remotely approaching that [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3185.0s)]
*  Or anything really [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3191.92s)]
*  In terms of a ground attack on Israelis could happen if the war ended tomorrow [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3193.92s)]
*  Given the damage that's been done to mass given how militarized that border is between Gaza and Israel [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3198.92s)]
*  So there's no military necessity to carry out this war [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3205.12s)]
*  Netanyahu's caring out for his political purposes and their people in his coalition including maybe Netanyahu himself [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3209.16s)]
*  Who would want to carry out to just continue to punish and destroy the Palestinian people if not ethnically cleanse them from Gaza [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3213.54s)]
*  Which is what a lot of the Trump plan [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3219.56s)]
*  You know saying Donald Trump says it's something the ministers in the Israeli government say the the humanitarian situation can be we're not over sitting it [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3223.2s)]
*  Nothing has gotten in since mid-march. Nothing. We're talking no food [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3231.0s)]
*  No medicine in a place where there already was no infrastructure left. They destroyed all the hospitals [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3234.7799999999997s)]
*  They destroyed all the schools destroyed basically all the buildings [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3240.2799999999997s)]
*  And so you're just talking about a place in which an already traumatized bombarded people [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3243.22s)]
*  Including a lot of injured people like badly injured people [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3249.12s)]
*  Are being bombed in tents with no food and medicine [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3252.56s)]
*  That's what's happening [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3256.7200000000003s)]
*  I was scrolling through Twitter yesterday and I saw a video of kind of the after [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3257.8s)]
*  Results of an airstrike and there was a little girl sitting on the ground and Oliver's blood in her head just started [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3264.48s)]
*  Gushing blood like I've never seen anyone bleed in my life [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3270.7200000000003s)]
*  And I realized I was watching the last moments of this little girl's life and this is happening every [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3273.32s)]
*  Single and what makes that? [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3278.88s)]
*  Okay, what makes that worth doing like what like don't tell me that that's what hostage is being brought home by that, you know [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3281.32s)]
*  so [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3289.36s)]
*  There's just this is an immoral abomination [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3290.4s)]
*  That will be a stain on this country and on Israel for the rest of our lives a moral stain a strategic dress that disaster [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3292.96s)]
*  Yeah, everything about it is wrong and cruel and it's [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3300.02s)]
*  Indefensible and just now that we're all [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3304.52s)]
*  Furious about this again [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3306.68s)]
*  It's worth highlighting this report on channel 13 news in Israel about the Biden administration's handling of the war in Gaza the policy generally [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3307.84s)]
*  So channel 13 talked to a bunch of top former Biden people is like nine administration officials [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3315.2s)]
*  They talked to a bunch of the Netanyahu government [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3320.0s)]
*  It's all in Hebrew [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3322.48s)]
*  But a couple sites dropped site news again, and then the times of Israel did write-ups of the main reporting and it is both [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3323.64s)]
*  Infuriating not surprising and confirms a lot of the assumptions we had from the very beginning about kind of what was happening behind the scenes [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3330.92s)]
*  So one of the most damning quotes came from Israeli ambassador [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3337.32s)]
*  To the US at the time who said that quote God did the state of Israel a favor that Biden was the president during this [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3341.0s)]
*  Period because it could have been much worse [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3346.88s)]
*  We fought in Gaza for over a year the administration never came to us and said ceasefire now [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3348.7200000000003s)]
*  It never did and that's not to be taken for granted [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3354.08s)]
*  So he's obviously trying to give Joe Biden credit there and in in so doing offering the most damning thing [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3357.3599999999997s)]
*  Observation you could about the administration a couple more things that jumped out on me been [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3364.2799999999997s)]
*  The administration reportedly debated having Biden give a speech that presented the Israeli people two paths in the hopes of forcing [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3368.72s)]
*  An election one path was get a hostage deal get a ceasefire get a normalization agreement with the Saudis [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3374.9599999999996s)]
*  The other path was what we're seeing now endless war diplomatic isolation [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3380.9199999999996s)]
*  But ultimately Biden just chickened out and didn't want to push BB politically and [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3385.3s)]
*  Instead did that speech where he laid out the framework for a ceasefire deal that I guess [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3390.1s)]
*  Netanyahu had told him he agreed to but later walked away from [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3394.3s)]
*  There was some stuff in the story about a Biden's team was particularly angry with Netanyahu when he released that video [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3398.2599999999998s)]
*  Accusing them of implementing a broad freeze on weapon shipments when in reality [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3405.1s)]
*  Biden had only held a single shipment of 2,000 pound bombs and that freeze was about to be resolved. So I guess the Netanyahu [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3410.48s)]
*  response [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3417.92s)]
*  You know destroy the deal [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3419.2400000000002s)]
*  They were about to cut to ship the bombs and so reading that I was like I get [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3420.84s)]
*  The frustration of these Biden staffers here because they're mad that Netanyahu lied about them [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3424.6800000000003s)]
*  But it's also very telling that the like biggest point of frustration was yeah, Biden like not getting credit for their mad [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3429.44s)]
*  They're mad about that and not about the 2,000 pound bombs being dropped on kids [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3436.5s)]
*  We'll come back to that. Yeah, so I just you know, it's a lot about the Saudi normalization deal [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3441.1400000000003s)]
*  There's people admitting what was obvious all along that and yeah, I was blocking a ceasefire for political purpose [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3446.5s)]
*  so again, like I said at the top like [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3451.54s)]
*  This was obvious at the time we talked about at the time [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3453.86s)]
*  Rereading it was absolutely enraging [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3457.2200000000003s)]
*  It was a reminder all over again of what a total fucking disgrace the Biden administration's policy on Gaza was [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3459.9399999999996s)]
*  just unrequited [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3467.4199999999996s)]
*  obsessive loyalty to Netanyahu [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3469.5s)]
*  blinded him to the [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3472.02s)]
*  Carnage in like total immorality of the policy and the US complicity in that policy and it's just it's outrageous [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3475.18s)]
*  Yeah, what's really enraging about this? [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3483.8599999999997s)]
*  Well, they're different layers of it but first of all and you summed it up well to try to add to that [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3486.78s)]
*  Look, we it was obvious at the time they were not really pressing them for this ceasefire [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3493.06s)]
*  It's just kind of confirms what we knew and that's what a lot of us are angry about that [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3497.3s)]
*  They were not implying any leverage. They weren't doing anything to try to really push the ceasefire [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3500.54s)]
*  They're saying so this is the second thing is they were saying at the time we're working like relentlessly. They were not [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3505.1400000000003s)]
*  They were not working relentlessly for a ceasefire [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3510.12s)]
*  They were talking about it publicly so that they had something to say and then [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3512.6400000000003s)]
*  privately, they're just shoveling weapons at Netanyahu and mainly complaining that Netanyahu wasn't giving them enough credit for shoveling the weapons to him, you know [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3517.4s)]
*  I mean, it's very revealing that [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3523.8s)]
*  They were upset [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3526.96s)]
*  by Netanyahu making that video because [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3528.84s)]
*  That that's about the politics of it [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3532.8s)]
*  They were so inside the politics of it that they weren't looking at the conduct of what was being done in Gaza in the same way [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3535.5s)]
*  I [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3541.34s)]
*  The other things I'd like to say about this. The first thing is that I think that they might [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3542.82s)]
*  Believe that they were doing more than they were, you know, like they and I'm not saying this to absolve them [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3548.38s)]
*  anything, but I [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3555.82s)]
*  Think they don't the Israeli ambassador's words are so damning because he's making clear it was a choice [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3558.94s)]
*  For the United States to unreservedly back what Israel did for that whole year. That was a choice [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3565.1400000000003s)]
*  It wasn't something that happened because of gravity. It wasn't something that happened because [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3571.34s)]
*  Politics inevitably means you support Israel unconditionally [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3575.54s)]
*  Joe Biden made a choice to provide unconditional military support to this Israeli government in this military operation and [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3578.5s)]
*  and just [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3586.06s)]
*  Mouthing words of concern about the scale of loss of life doesn't matter. You made that choice [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3588.1000000000004s)]
*  Another thing this Saudi normalization thing kept coming up [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3594.5s)]
*  Like I don't understand why they miss this opportunity because you fundamentally and what is amazing to me [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3597.46s)]
*  Some of these people are people that kind of put themselves forward is like experts on Israel. It's fundamentally misunderstanding [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3602.88s)]
*  This is really government given the choice between having like commercial flights between Riyadh and Jerusalem and [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3607.82s)]
*  Ethnically cleansing Gaza, of course, they're gonna choose to ethnically cleanse Gaza [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3614.78s)]
*  Why do we understand this Israeli government better than you do like or even just like even more? [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3618.62s)]
*  Pathetic and selfish the choice between direct flights to Riyadh or Netanyahu staying in power exactly. Yeah [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3623.02s)]
*  Yeah, that's right because with Netanyahu it's staying in power with like Ben Gavir and Smotrich [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3630.42s)]
*  It's the West Bank and Gaza West Bank and Gaza are much more important than a Saudi normalization deal [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3634.3799999999997s)]
*  and so what we're still like talking about Israel as if it's our version of what our version of Israel or [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3638.98s)]
*  Democratic Party foreign policy version of Israel is like well, of course [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3644.8199999999997s)]
*  They'll want normalization with Saudi Arabia more than they'll want to like, you know [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3647.74s)]
*  kill the two-state solution and try to take back West West Bank and Gaza like [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3651.7s)]
*  That that's misreading this government. The last thing I want to say Tommy is like and we can have a conversation about this like I [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3656.3799999999997s)]
*  I try to hold some space here because [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3662.06s)]
*  It's if you've listened to this podcast for six seven years. I [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3666.62s)]
*  I'll speak for myself. I don't speak for you, but I think you've probably gone through a similar process [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3671.54s)]
*  But I've had to deprogram a bit. So yeah, I was much more defensive in [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3675.2599999999998s)]
*  2017 about for sure drone strikes or [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3680.46s)]
*  You know things that we did that we were part of some things that were wrong [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3684.02s)]
*  We were part of actually because some things that are just baked into US national security are wrong, right? [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3687.26s)]
*  and [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3692.42s)]
*  And and it's been nice to have this forum and to interact obviously with so many people around the world [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3694.1s)]
*  And and and force us to not do that [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3700.42s)]
*  You know to be more honest about and we're still I'm not suggesting we're all the way there yet [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3704.02s)]
*  my advice to these people [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3709.7799999999997s)]
*  Some of whom we know well, some of whom are friends is [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3711.8999999999996s)]
*  Don't do that. Like don't rationalize [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3715.2999999999997s)]
*  Don't explain the best spin, you know [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3719.14s)]
*  Don't try to pick the one time that Biden said something that makes it look like you pressured Israel like [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3723.3799999999997s)]
*  In fact, don't talk about it all right now. I actually wondered why nine people talked to channel 13 Israel [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3730.1s)]
*  Sit with this think about it [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3736.62s)]
*  Like like absorb it [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3739.22s)]
*  Listen to people in Gaza [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3741.8599999999997s)]
*  Like consume those images and I'm not I don't want this to come across [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3744.18s)]
*  Preachy I really don't I say this is someone who did that thing of like defending everything we did and and tying myself in knots [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3750.5s)]
*  It's not healthy, you know, like so this is not me. I swear to God [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3757.58s)]
*  This is not I'm not trying to come at this from some highfalutin place. I'm saying actually as someone who's [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3761.2999999999997s)]
*  That's the wrong path [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3766.7000000000003s)]
*  there's another path of [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3768.7400000000002s)]
*  Because actually it'd be good for American foreign policy and Democratic Party National foreign policy for people to to [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3770.54s)]
*  to truly evolve and [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3778.1s)]
*  And be like, you know, that's wrong, you know [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3780.62s)]
*  Give courage to the next generation of foreign policy staffers who are [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3783.3s)]
*  Scared that they are gonna get destroyed by a pack or these groups that are attacking [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3788.46s)]
*  You know youtubers like miss Rachel if she you know speaks about the humanity of the Palestinian people like like break that cycle [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3793.66s)]
*  Yeah, I'm totally with you on the broader point that it took me forever [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3800.98s)]
*  To do a better job of thinking for myself gaining perspective reading more learning more like you just grow as a human being you understand [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3805.22s)]
*  More but also just on this narrow policy [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3811.96s)]
*  I guess what I'd ask people is I don't care how hard [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3814.2999999999997s)]
*  Joe Biden worked a problem. We nobody cares what I care is about the outcome [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3819.18s)]
*  Yeah, you know what I mean and look at what's happening on the ground. Like it is a fucking disaster [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3823.34s)]
*  More people are dead [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3828.86s)]
*  1600 people are dead since the seats fire ended that you guys couldn't get over the finish line that the Trump somehow got over [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3829.96s)]
*  the finish line and [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3835.82s)]
*  I know these are not easy problems. They're brutally hard every option after October 7th was a bad option [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3837.1800000000003s)]
*  but blind loyalty to BB Net and Yahoo a [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3842.82s)]
*  right-wing autocrat was a massive mistake and like we just have to [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3846.94s)]
*  Acknowledge that because of the damage it did to the people in Gaza, but also the damage it did to the Democratic Party [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3851.38s)]
*  Yeah, it's indefensible. And and the thing is sometimes [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3856.26s)]
*  You're again your program to think about because you actually don't come to work thinking you want to do that [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3859.94s)]
*  You come to work thinking you want to ceasefire you come to work thinking, you know [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3864.86s)]
*  We just need to get through this and maybe the next phone call with BB like it'll work out [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3868.7000000000003s)]
*  but part of what you have to wrestle with is [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3872.58s)]
*  Let's your point just the fact that you were in a lot of meetings and you stayed up late and a lot of phone calls [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3875.46s)]
*  Made and trips were made [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3879.82s)]
*  The world experiences the outputs it's kind of like we're saying with Trump in reality and [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3882.7000000000003s)]
*  The reality is that the system that was built [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3887.78s)]
*  Is part of the problem the system that was built to just shovel those weapons to the Israeli government [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3891.46s)]
*  That's part of the problem and you're never gonna change that system [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3896.46s)]
*  If you're just defending how you manage the system at the time [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3899.5s)]
*  Yeah, and by the way hands up right like Barack Obama signed a 10-year MOU [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3903.7400000000002s)]
*  Yes, that was wrong that was wrong and we did that in part because we were defensive about the Iran deal wrong [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3908.1s)]
*  We shouldn't have done that. We knew who BB was we should not have signed a 10-year member [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3913.88s)]
*  I'm sure I defended at the time that was wrong like you that system that that was a part of [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3918.14s)]
*  was the wrong system and [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3924.7400000000002s)]
*  And you'll never really change the system if you're kind of constantly defending your management of it, you know [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3926.98s)]
*  Yeah, and just one last point on this. I mean of the nine people like [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3932.3s)]
*  Officials quoted in that story and I don't even know who all of them are because I didn't watch the video [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3937.7799999999997s)]
*  I just read the reports. I mean think probably a couple were actually in [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3942.46s)]
*  High-level meetings with Joe Biden all the time. I'm not this is not a staff problem [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3946.58s)]
*  There were clearly some staffers who I think were in a bad place and providing very very bad advice to Joe Biden [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3950.74s)]
*  But this begins and ends with him like this was clearly a problem [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3956.42s)]
*  100% he owned to the great detriment of the policy outcome, but also to himself politically [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3960.62s)]
*  Yeah, because I get I'm in reading the shaked haper book [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=3966.64s)]

*  So I want to start with the current situation [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4188.66s)]
*  In Ukraine where we've seen an increase in Russian strikes recently including an attack on Keeve last week [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4192.099999999999s)]

*  Putin openly demonstrate that he doesn't want peace and [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4213.26s)]
*  It's obvious Putin started this large-scale war not because he want to occupy just one part more of Ukrainian land [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4218.34s)]
*  Putin started this large-scale war because he want to occupy and destroy the whole country and go further [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4226.66s)]
*  His logic is historical. He dreams about his legacy [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4233.18s)]
*  He want to forcibly restore Russian Empire and with this air strike in [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4238.02s)]
*  Sumi in Krivory in Odessa and in Kiev recently with all these [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4244.22s)]
*  Dozens of killed civilians and children and destroyed residential buildings [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4249.54s)]
*  Putin openly [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4255.78s)]
*  Demonstrate his disregard to President Donald Trump [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4258.18s)]
*  Yeah, I want to ask you a bit more about [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4262.02s)]
*  Your work but but just on the the negotiations that are taking place [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4266.14s)]
*  What is it like to live through the reality where there is this conversation happening? [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4272.58s)]
*  internationally outside of Ukraine [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4279.1s)]
*  Largely between the American administration and the Russians and at times with the Ukrainian government [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4281.3s)]
*  At the same time that there's a war ongoing inside of Ukraine [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4288.820000000001s)]
*  I mean, what is it like to live in a reality where? [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4293.26s)]
*  These issues are being discussed, you know in international capitals and yet your reality is still the same [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4296.3s)]
*  It's a reality of war [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4304.02s)]
*  recent weeks we heard a lot about [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4306.54s)]
*  natural minerals about Russia's territorial claims about geopolitical interest [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4309.26s)]
*  But we didn't hear about people and I think that it's not okay [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4314.9800000000005s)]
*  Because this war has a very vivid human dimension and [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4320.1s)]
*  We still want to get an answer to a very important questions [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4324.5s)]
*  what will be with more than 20,000 Ukrainian children illegally deported to Russia separated with their families and [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4329.9s)]
*  Supposed to be adopted by Russian families who will bring them up as Russians [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4338.42s)]
*  What will be with thousands and thousands illegally detained civilians men and women? [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4342.82s)]
*  Subjected to horrible torture and sexual abuse daily. I personally interviewed hundreds of them and [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4348.26s)]
*  They told me how they were beaten raped smashed into wooden boxes [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4355.54s)]
*  Their fingers were cut their nails were turned away their nails were drilled [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4360.3s)]
*  They were electrically shocked through their genitalia one woman told me how he or I was dug out with a spoon [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4364.3s)]
*  knowing this it's very [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4372.099999999999s)]
*  Understandable that at least part of these people have a very less chance to be alive until the end of this political process and [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4374.700000000001s)]
*  finally what will be with [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4383.1s)]
*  millions of Ukrainians who live under Russian occupation [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4385.660000000001s)]
*  They live in a gray zone [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4390.02s)]
*  They have no tools how to defend their rights their freedom their property their lives their children their beloved ones and [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4391.820000000001s)]
*  Russian occupation is not just changing one state flag to another [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4399.14s)]
*  Russian occupation means in force disappearances torture rapes denial of your identity [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4403.66s)]
*  Forcible adoption of your own children filtration camps and mass graves. So I feel bad. I [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4410.219999999999s)]
*  Think we have to return human dimension into political process only in that way [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4417.219999999999s)]
*  We can find a path to sustainable peace [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4423.799999999999s)]
*  All that documentation that you've done through your work in your organization [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4428.0199999999995s)]
*  connects to [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4433.0599999999995s)]
*  Something that you've been outspoken about which is the need for there to be accountability for these crimes of aggression [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4434.299999999999s)]
*  these these crimes against humanity [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4440.62s)]
*  How do you approach that knowing that [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4444.62s)]
*  In terms of if you're the Ukrainian government [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4448.46s)]
*  You know that Putin is not going to obviously want to agree to any process of accountability [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4452.54s)]
*  How do you think about you know, there's so much discussion of territory and security guarantees and these are very important things [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4458.46s)]
*  But how do you think about this question of accountability? How do you think the world should approach? [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4465.46s)]
*  Accountability in the context of these negotiations and any future [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4470.42s)]
*  End to the to the war all this hell which you now faced in Ukraine [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4475.0599999999995s)]
*  It's result of total impunity which Russia enjoyed for decades [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4481.139999999999s)]
*  Because Russian troops committed horrible crimes in Chechnya in Moldova in Georgia in Mali in [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4485.54s)]
*  Libya in Syria in other countries of the world and they have never been punished they believe [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4492.18s)]
*  They can do whatever they want and [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4499.06s)]
*  For 11 years we have been documented how Russian troops physically exterminate active local people on the ground [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4502.9400000000005s)]
*  Mayors journalists children writers musicians teachers environmentalists priests [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4511.3s)]
*  how they banned Ukrainian language and culture how they [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4517.3s)]
*  Destroyed and roped Ukrainian cultural heritage how they abducted Ukrainian children and send them to Russia to bring them up as Russians [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4521.82s)]
*  So for me, it's obvious that justice is [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4530.3s)]
*  precondition to peace [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4534.94s)]
*  Because we have to change this long-lasting tradition of impunity [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4537.299999999999s)]
*  We must break this circle of impunity and not just for Ukrainians [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4543.62s)]
*  but in order to prevent a next Russian attack to the next nation and [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4547.86s)]
*  I'm doing this work with responsibility and with a hope [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4553.099999999999s)]
*  Because hope it's not a confidence that everything will be fine. But hope it's a [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4558.74s)]
*  Deep understanding that all other efforts have a huge meaning and and how do you? [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4565.759999999999s)]
*  You know as as an activist as someone in civil society as someone who's been documenting all of this injustice [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4573.639999999999s)]
*  You also have a situation where [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4582.04s)]
*  your government is in this very difficult position where it's it's [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4585.5199999999995s)]
*  Fighting a relentless aggressor in Putin and it now has an American government [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4589.96s)]
*  That seems more intent on putting pressure on the Ukrainian government than on the Russian government [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4596.16s)]
*  How would you like to see your government operate in these negotiations [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4603.96s)]
*  What is what is the mood in terms of how civil society is relating to the Ukrainian government right now? [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4608.92s)]
*  it's not easy situation and [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4615.4s)]
*  Probably it's not just [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4618.4400000000005s)]
*  Ukrainian problem that in 21st century a state decided that when you have a [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4621.6s)]
*  Strong military potential a nuclear weapon you can break international order [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4629.08s)]
*  you can dictate your rules to entire international community and [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4634.4400000000005s)]
*  You can even forcibly changed internationally recognized borders. I think it's not just problem for Ukraine [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4638.68s)]
*  because [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4645.76s)]
*  look at my work, I'm a human rights lawyer and [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4646.96s)]
*  For years I am applying the law to defend people and human dignity for current moment [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4651.72s)]
*  I have no tools how to stop Russian atrocities [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4656.82s)]
*  It shows the vulnerability of the whole international [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4661.08s)]
*  Architecture. Well, yeah, I was gonna ask you [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4666.08s)]
*  I mean, where do you think those tools could come from right because there's there's the power of what you're doing [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4668.28s)]
*  Which is kind of bearing witness [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4672.84s)]
*  documentation organization on the ground [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4674.76s)]
*  But it seems like the tools of international justice [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4676.92s)]
*  lack [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4680.72s)]
*  Capacity, right? So Putin can be charged with war crimes by the National Criminal Court, but he can evade responsibility for that [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4682.16s)]
*  There are allies who provide, you know weapons and other kinds of support to Ukraine [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4690.04s)]
*  But it's not quite enough to overcome Russia [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4694.14s)]
*  I mean, I'm not asking you to kind of solve the puzzle of of international [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4697.28s)]
*  justice here [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4703.92s)]
*  but [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4705.4400000000005s)]
*  But what have you learned through this experience of the work you've done the experience of being in Ukraine these years? [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4706.52s)]
*  About the need for a greater solidarity or prioritization of these issues [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4712.320000000001s)]
*  internationally [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4717.360000000001s)]
*  Several things to comment first. You are totally right the international order which is based on UN Charter and [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4718.64s)]
*  International law is collapsing before our eyes and there were reasons for this [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4726.080000000001s)]
*  This international architecture was established past century [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4730.6s)]
*  It's provide for several countries irrational privileges and now it just stalling its reproducing ritualistic movements [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4734.84s)]
*  The work of Security Council is paralyzed [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4742.599999999999s)]
*  And now it's easy to predict that such fires like worse can emerge more and more often in different parts of the globe because this [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4745.5599999999995s)]
*  International wiring is faulty and sparks are everywhere [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4753.08s)]
*  But still even in such circumstances, there are a room for decisive legal actions to [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4756.12s)]
*  Establish law and justice we can create a special tribunal and aggression [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4762.820000000001s)]
*  to hold Putin Lukashenko and Tom political leadership and high military command of Russian state accountable and more than [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4768.58s)]
*  40 countries are discussing the modalities of the special tribunal to fill this gap of accountability [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4775.820000000001s)]
*  When there is no international court which can prosecute Putin for the crime of aggression [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4781.780000000001s)]
*  But everything which we are documented it's result of his leadership decision to start such work [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4787.219999999999s)]
*  so it just one example and not to end to the [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4793.58s)]
*  negative note [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4798.0599999999995s)]
*  Let me tell you the main [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4799.78s)]
*  Lesson learned which I have from this year so far [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4803.0199999999995s)]
*  People have power [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4806.38s)]
*  We get used to thinking through the categories of states and interstates organizations [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4808.3s)]
*  But ordinary people have a much great power that they can even imagine ordinary people can change history and [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4813.34s)]
*  Ukrainians are one of example because three years ago. Nobody believed that we can [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4821.38s)]
*  Provide resistance [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4827.9400000000005s)]
*  For more than three or four days to such nervous opposing powers Russia is [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4829.780000000001s)]
*  Even our international partners were confident that we have no potential to resist. I was in Kiev [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4835.14s)]
*  When all international organization evacuated their personal they left us alone but ordinary people remained [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4841.7s)]
*  ordinary people started to do extra ordinary things and [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4849.54s)]
*  Suddenly it became obvious that ordinary people fighting for their freedom and human dignity are stronger [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4853.379999999999s)]
*  That even the Second Army in the world [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4860.58s)]
*  yeah, I mean I want to ask you about Ukraine and in the longer journey because [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4863.379999999999s)]
*  This all began well [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4868.34s)]
*  It's hard to trace an exact beginning, but it's also the case that ordinary people stood up in them on the Maidan [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4871.139999999999s)]
*  Over a decade ago and began this journey of trying to throw off corruption throw off Russian influence assert [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4879.46s)]
*  Ukrainian sovereignty and identity and here we are over ten years later and Ukrainians are still fighting for those things [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4887.26s)]
*  Do you think Ukraine has changed over the last ten years? [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4894.14s)]
*  I mean, how do you feel like the the identity of the Ukrainian people has changed based on? [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4897.66s)]
*  you know ordinary people trying to reclaim their power in the face of [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4903.900000000001s)]
*  You know Putin who kind of is the most [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4908.38s)]
*  You know core representation of [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4912.1s)]
*  authoritarian power in the world how is Ukraine's [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4914.900000000001s)]
*  struggle against that changed the country and the people [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4918.46s)]
*  Eleven years ago millions of people in Ukraine stood up their ways against [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4922.18s)]
*  Prorussian corrupt authoritarian government and they peacefully [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4927.06s)]
*  Demonstrated just for a chance to build a country where the rights of everybody are protected [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4931.18s)]
*  government is accountable judiciary is independent and police do not beat students who are peacefully demonstrated and [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4937.06s)]
*  We are paying the highest price just for this chance [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4944.66s)]
*  I know what I'm talking about because I was coordinator of civil initiative you ever might done SOS during the Revolution of Dignity [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4947.78s)]
*  We brought up several thousands of people. We worked 24 hour per day to provide legal assistance [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4955.18s)]
*  to persecuted protesters [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4962.62s)]
*  every day hundreds hundreds of people who are beaten arrested tortured accused and fabricated criminal cases pass over here and [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4964.78s)]
*  when authoritarian regime collapse and [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4973.139999999999s)]
*  We got our chance [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4975.86s)]
*  to start this [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4978.22s)]
*  Democratic transition in order to stop us on this way Putin invaded [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4980.1s)]
*  Putin occupied Crimea part of Luhansk and Donetsk regions and three years ago [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4985.06s)]
*  Extended this war to the large-scale invasion because Putin is not afraid of NATO [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4990.34s)]
*  Putin is afraid of idea of freedom which came closer to Russian borders [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=4996.1s)]
*  So we have the possibility to reform our country just for 11 years [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5001.139999999999s)]
*  we [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5007.74s)]
*  Pay the highest price for this possibility and we have to do it during the war [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5008.9s)]
*  Can you imagine the burden it's very difficult to make a democratic transition even during peaceful time [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5014.62s)]
*  the countries [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5022.0599999999995s)]
*  From European Union United States they spayed decades sometimes centuries to build sustainable democratic institutions [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5024.1s)]
*  We have just 11 years and we have to do it during the war [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5030.900000000001s)]
*  But believe me the country is rapidly changed [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5035.06s)]
*  because [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5039.54s)]
*  It's about responsibility [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5041.3s)]
*  We want to to do our job [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5043.780000000001s)]

*  Having to pay the blood for freedom and for human dignity and when you look to the future [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5057.86s)]
*  What what kind of Ukraine would you like to see? [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5064.98s)]
*  Emerge from this war. I mean, there's the immediate questions about [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5068.66s)]
*  How much territory Ukraine can maintain but there are also questions of security guarantees or questions of when? [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5072.78s)]
*  Ukraine can join the European Union [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5080.62s)]
*  But just in terms of what kind of Ukraine you would like to see after the war [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5082.94s)]
*  What what do you envision? What what what do you believe in in terms of the future for Ukraine? [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5087.74s)]
*  If I can say of a language of dream, I want to see my country in a way that [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5092.0599999999995s)]
*  such [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5099.94s)]
*  Such organization like us like Center for civil liberties in our current [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5102.219999999999s)]
*  functions [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5109.299999999999s)]
*  Are not needed [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5110.62s)]
*  This will be Ukraine which we want [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5113.299999999999s)]
*  that [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5115.98s)]
*  The rule of law is dominated people are protected their rights are protected [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5117.62s)]
*  So we can just grow our children in peace and have a freedom to live without fear of violence [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5122.5s)]
*  have a freedom to have a long-term perspective and [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5129.0599999999995s)]
*  It's simple things, but it's not given for granted [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5132.7s)]
*  Especially [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5136.58s)]
*  Taking into account that [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5137.86s)]
*  We have also to develop the long-lasting strategy towards Russia [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5140.46s)]
*  Because Russia is Empire and Empire has a center but has no borders Empire always tries to expand [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5146.02s)]
*  It's like Putin told that borders of Russia [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5153.22s)]
*  Will never ends and I saw it even in my human rights work when I interviewed people who survived Russian captivity [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5158.02s)]
*  They told me that Russians see their future like this first will occupy Ukraine and then together with you [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5165.34s)]
*  We will go to conquer another countries and if those are the stakes what would you say to Americans? [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5173.26s)]
*  Who are being told by Trump that it's time to move on from this that this is not important to the United States that [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5181.1s)]
*  We just needed to get out of this war [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5189.860000000001s)]
*  That it cost too much money [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5193.26s)]
*  You know, we have an audience includes not just Americans but American policymakers [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5195.46s)]
*  What would you say to them about why this matters to the rest of the world including to the United States? [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5200.860000000001s)]

*  majority of people in United States supported our struggle for freedom and for me as for human it's obvious because we are fighting for [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5225.299999999999s)]
*  Something that has no limitation in national borders. It's freedom and [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5233.379999999999s)]
*  Human solidarity is also one of such things which have no limitation in national borders and we all know from the world [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v29KNcekITw&t=5239.219999999999s)]
