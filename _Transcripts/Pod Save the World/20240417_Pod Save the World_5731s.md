Video Description: Tommy Vietor and Ben Rhodes discuss Iran’s missile and drone attack on Israel and whether Israel will retaliate, Biden’s message of restraint to Prime Minister Netanyahu, the republicans calling for all out war with Iran, and what Iran’s strike means for efforts to end the war in Gaza and pass additional funding for Israel and Ukraine. They also talk about Ukrainian President Zelensky’s criticism of other countries’ willingness to shoot down Iranian missiles but not those from Russia, a grim anniversary for the civil war in Sudan, a mass stabbing in Australia, former US Ambassador Manuel Rocha pleading guilty to being a Cuban spy, and the arrival of Meghan Markle’s strawberry jam. Then Tommy talks with Middle East expert Khaled Elgindy about post-war reconstruction in Gaza, and what kind of political path forward could actually create a Palestinian state.

*  Process so important talk mark such a thoughtful guy. Yeah [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=162.72s)]
*  good follow on [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=166.92000000000002s)]
*  X to do you call it X I [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=168.56s)]
*  Don't think I've ever done it before that's why I said X, you know, just such a lame name. Yeah, it is lame [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=172.56s)]
*  Why did he choose that? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=177.0s)]
*  Okay. Well, let's start with this Iranian attack on Israel from over the weekend [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=178.48s)]
*  According to the Pentagon Iran fired 100 ballistic missiles 30 cruise missiles and 150 explosive drones at Israel on Saturday [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=182.64s)]
*  99% of them were intercepted and miraculously. No one was killed though [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=191.67999999999998s)]
*  A seven-year-old girl was seriously wounded a lot of the missiles and drones were shot down by Israeli missile defense systems like the Iron Dome [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=195.83999999999997s)]
*  David sling in the arrow three system which Ben you probably remember received billions of dollars of funding from the Obama administration [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=203.32s)]
*  So for all the attacks you hear about Obama abandoning Israel [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=212.2s)]
*  In fact those investments save countless Israeli lives [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=214.83999999999997s)]
*  But in addition to those systems those missile defense systems [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=218.11999999999998s)]
*  The Pentagon says US fighters shot down 70 drones and US warships and Patriot missile batteries in the region [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  Shot down about a half a dozen Iranian missiles Israel also got support from the UK France Jordan Saudi Arabia [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=227.88s)]
*  this attack from Iran was a long-awaited response to Israel's assassination of [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=234.2s)]
*  several top members the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps IRGC [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=238.72s)]
*  in an Iranian diplomatic facility in Syria [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=242.2s)]
*  according to the Wall Street Journal [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=245.11999999999998s)]
*  Iran actually briefed several Gulf countries on their attack plan days in advance [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=247.16s)]
*  Yeah, I guess to deconflict their airspace but notable [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=252.11999999999998s)]
*  But that also gave Israel a lot of time to prepare to the point where President Biden was able to fly back from Delaware [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=255.0s)]
*  To the White House to be in the situation room for this all to go down [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=261.0s)]
*  So since the attack Biden has talked with Netanyahu. He did a call with the g7 leaders. He called the King of Jordan [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  He called the squadron leaders that helped shoot down all these drones. We're now all waiting to see if Israel responds [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=271.36s)]
*  Israel's defense minister told Lloyd Austin the Secretary of Defense that [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=277.36s)]
*  Israel has no choice but to respond according to news reports [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=281.4s)]
*  Netanyahu has reportedly requested a bunch of response options from the IDF [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=284.64s)]
*  So Ben, um, the fact that these like Sunni Arab countries like Saudi Arabia and Jordan were part of a coalition [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  Defending Israel is fascinating to me. I know they hate Iran and have for a long time [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=295.4s)]
*  But still it's shocking that they defended Israel to the point where you know [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=299.84s)]
*  These missiles were landing on Jordanian soil and potentially wounding Jordanians [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=303.47999999999996s)]
*  But also we've seen that Biden's message to be B. Netanyahu is basically take the win. Don't escalate [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=307.4s)]
*  It's not clear if he's gonna follow that advice [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  But certainly they can kind of turn the dial up or down if they want [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=315.88s)]
*  I suspect a cyber attack or a response on Iranian proxies in Syria [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=318.64s)]
*  For example might have a less inflammatory feel to it. Whereas a direct strike on Iran could cause things to explode [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=322.59999999999997s)]
*  But what are you looking for? And what did you make of that? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=328.96s)]
*  Initial volley on Saturday night [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=331.88s)]
*  I mean, I know we were texting back and forth like pretty pretty scary five hours [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=333.23999999999995s)]
*  Is it around the way for those things to get into Israeli airspace? Yeah [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=336.67999999999995s)]
*  I mean, it's a new you know, a lot of new things have happened since October 7th [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=339.96s)]
*  And this is definitely you know a new dynamic where Iran is signaling they're willing to attack Israel from Iranian soil [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=344.59999999999997s)]
*  we talked about the fact that [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=351.96s)]
*  Israel attacked the Iranian Embassy compound in Damascus [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=354.08s)]
*  Sovereign Iranian territory. So that's the logic that the Iranians used to justify this attack as a reciprocal attack [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=358.52s)]
*  It's interesting to me like if Iran truly wanted to escalate into like a war with Israel [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=366.59999999999997s)]
*  They did the opposite of that, you know [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=373.64s)]
*  They didn't use the thousands of rockets that they've provided to his blow over the years that are very close to Israel and would [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=376.68s)]
*  I think be able to evade at least some of the air defense systems [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=383.71999999999997s)]
*  they [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=387.76s)]
*  Announced that they were doing this briefed it [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=389.03999999999996s)]
*  and honestly if you're trying to like [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=392.0s)]
*  You know whether it's because of [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=394.71999999999997s)]
*  deliberate [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=397.15999999999997s)]
*  Not wanting to escalate further or whether they're incompetent. Whatever the reason is [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=398.48s)]
*  flying drones for several hours over other countries in the direction of a country that you know has incredibly sophisticated air defense systems [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=404.08s)]
*  Is kind of a strange way of going about trying to actually land a punch [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=412.2s)]
*  Although they did the ballistic missiles and that's the thing where I the ballistic missiles and the cruise missiles [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=417.08s)]
*  You know, I think are intended to kind of send a message look at this capability [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=423.12s)]
*  We have and actually I think part of what we learned is just how good the air defense systems are that you know [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=426.15999999999997s)]
*  Even Iran having these ballistic missiles is not any guarantee that they can [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=430.84s)]
*  again land that [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=435.28s)]
*  Obviously land a punch, but I hate to like trivialize what is a very serious situation [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=437.56s)]
*  So all that to say is that Iran was clearly trying to calibrate in the kind of weird signaling of the Middle East where [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=441.44s)]
*  Well, we have to respond but we we don't want to escalate it further [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=446.68s)]
*  They put it at a statement out like the you pointed my tend to do right away Tommy from the Iranian [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=450.68s)]
*  Representative at the UN that immediately was like, okay, we're done. We're good. Yeah, we're good [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=456.36s)]
*  Oh, we're cool. We're cool, you know [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=460.04s)]
*  Like and so the whole thing was kind of strange in that it was a huge escalation [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=461.98s)]
*  It was you know, obviously an outrageous thing for them to do [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=467.12s)]
*  Very dangerous for the Israeli people very thankful that they were able to shoot down so much of this and also like very calibrated by [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=470.74s)]
*  Iran to try to contain its own escalation, you know [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=478.22s)]
*  So what happens now? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=482.26s)]
*  Well, you know in the kind of strange back and forth, you know, the balls in Israel's court [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=484.26s)]
*  And I think it's worth saying like you don't need to swing at every pitch here [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=489.78000000000003s)]
*  You know like that there's if they the options available to them the escalatory option would be to [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=494.9s)]
*  Launch an attack at Iranian soil, you know [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=501.82s)]
*  So if they choose to bomb Iranian military facilities or certainly Iranian nuclear facilities anything in Iran [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=504.82s)]
*  Then I think Iran and the kind of crazy logic of the Middle East would feel like then they need to respond [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=511.06s)]
*  In a bigger way than they did last time and that's how you keep the escalation going [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=516.22s)]
*  There are other options available one is, you know not [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=519.86s)]
*  You know bombing something again like my my my kids learn in kindergarten [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=522.86s)]
*  Like you don't always have to hit back you can talk you can talk [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=528.18s)]
*  Diplomacy might work but even like other pathways are available [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=531.5s)]
*  You mentioned like a cyber option something inside Iran [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=535.66s)]
*  That's not that visible but also like hitting these Iranian proxy forces and I don't want to diminish that [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=539.26s)]
*  But you know, we've seen Israel take strikes against Iranian proxies in Lebanon and Syria in Iraq [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=545.42s)]
*  So there are different ways there's also Iranian naval assets [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=550.8000000000001s)]
*  Or sanctions say there's all kinds of things they can do and what the US clearly does not want is [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=555.2s)]
*  Israel to hit Iran directly and then Iran sitting back and this war could escalate to Lebanon [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=561.44s)]
*  Iraq across the region US could get pulled in Iran could shut down [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=566.76s)]
*  You know the Straits of Hormuz through which massive amounts of the global economy pass [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=571.2s)]
*  And all of a sudden there's huge global economic shocks oil prices through the roof risks the US service members [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=575.72s)]
*  That's what we don't want to have happen [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=581.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean look when when Trump ordered the assassination of Qasem Soleimani [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=583.04s)]
*  Then the head of the IRGC the Iranians responded by firing over a dozen ballistic missiles that US forces at bases in the region [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=586.48s)]
*  Miraculously, no one was killed but a hundred US service members got traumatic brain injuries, but Trump to his credit [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=594.68s)]
*  Left it there like the in that case [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=600.96s)]
*  To the Iranian sent a message saying like okay. This is it for us. We're done [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=603.52s)]
*  They're like that weird kind of little guy in the schoolyard that runs up to the big bully and punched them the face [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=606.96s)]
*  It's like, okay, it's over. Yeah, but you know, it's effective at the time Ben [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=611.96s)]
*  But you know stepping back like I am I'm really glad the US did all this took all these steps to protect [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=615.4s)]
*  Israeli civilians and that no one was killed in these strikes [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=621.1999999999999s)]
*  It was very frustrating to me though to immediately watch the conversation about the Iranian attack in Washington [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=623.76s)]
*  Just completely omit the fact that this was the Iranians responding to Israel bombing the Iranian consulate in Damascus [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=629.76s)]
*  Like part of the conversation should be don't do that [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=636.76s)]
*  You know what I mean? And like everyone in DC is always talking about deterrence and what it entails [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=639.56s)]
*  But they never pause to think I wonder if starting wars is maybe not the best way to prevent them [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=644.96s)]
*  You know, you know unless you think I'm kind of exaggerating or doing a straw man of a Republican listen to this cut of [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=650.72s)]
*  Listen to this cut of [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=657.2s)]
*  Trump's former national security advisor John Bolton senator Tom Cotton and congressman rich McCormick from Georgia from various TV shows [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=659.48s)]
*  Way to reestablish deterrence is not proportional. That's academic talk [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=667.0s)]
*  The way you establish deterrence is by telling your adversary if you ever try that again [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=671.76s)]
*  The price you will pay will be so much higher than any gain you think you can get you shouldn't even think about it [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=676.64s)]
*  I think Israel should be looking at this as an opportunity to destroy Iran's nuclear weapons program [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=682.96s)]
*  Which is the existential threat that Israel faces President Biden is wrong telling Israel that they should respond [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=688.88s)]
*  Imagine America getting 300 drones and missiles shot at our homeland and having a country telling us not to respond now [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=695.28s)]
*  It's up to Prime Minister Net Yahu and his war cabinet and ultimately the elected government and people of Israel about how and when they respond [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=702.38s)]
*  It's hard to imagine this doesn't steal their resolve to finish the job against Hamas and Gaza [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=710.08s)]
*  There's no commensurate response except for power [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=715.2s)]
*  The only way to end the wars and it quickly if you draw this out [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=718.04s)]
*  It's gonna have bad results which take out their capability to produce drones [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=721.28s)]
*  We stake out their capability of producing the income and we'd undercut the entire terror process around the world [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=725.16s)]
*  Whether it be the Houthis the Hamas Hezbollah or Iran itself [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=731.36s)]
*  Who's that good a boy at the end? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=735.96s)]
*  McCormick I never heard of me there but apparently all of them didn't open a newspaper through the duration of the war on terror [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=738.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=742.9200000000001s)]
*  Any lessons I? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=743.9200000000001s)]
*  We should spend just a minute on this because it's totally crazy and yeah, John Bolton [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=746.2s)]
*  You know like principal architect or one of the architects of the Iraq war [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=750.8000000000001s)]
*  Really good track record and actually a bit of a tell that he's like this is an opportunity for yeah [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=754.72s)]
*  Like he literally sees getting attacked as an opportunity. But now we get to bomb more things, you know, and [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=759.44s)]
*  These are these are not inevitable choices again to wind back the tape like [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=764.56s)]
*  There are consequences to pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal. There are consequences to assassinating Qasem Soleimani [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=769.84s)]
*  There are consequences to bombing an Iranian diplomatic facility [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=775.24s)]
*  None of that means that Iran are good guys or that they were sympathizing with the Iranians [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=778.28s)]
*  What we're saying is the logic of like picking fights with people and tearing up diplomatic agreements is you end up in wars with them? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=782.92s)]
*  You don't always have to be the victim either. Yeah, it's story doesn't start where you want it to start [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=789.04s)]
*  The thing about Washington so crazy is that the story literally for this whole thing started with the Iranian attack [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=792.52s)]
*  We've been saying since October 7th that that there's this risk of escalation [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=798.12s)]
*  There's this increased tension across the region [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=801.96s)]
*  The Middle East is gonna be a tinderbox [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=803.92s)]
*  So long as this war is going on Israel's policy in Gaza that a lot of people in Washington were upset about like a week ago [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=805.36s)]
*  Now nobody's talking about it, which by the way is one of the outcomes that maybe Bibi Nanyo is okay with right? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=811.88s)]
*  We'll get to that and and so this is an insane way of thinking [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=817.52s)]
*  And again, I think part of what's strange to me Tommy to bring politics into this a little bit is some of this is [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=822.56s)]
*  They are John Bolton. He believes this like, you know [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=828.4399999999999s)]
*  He's a true believer in that the next wars is gonna be the one that turns out well, you know [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=831.4s)]
*  Yeah [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=836.3199999999999s)]
*  and the architect and the architect of the maximum pressure strategy on Iran that was supposed to prevent all of failed all these [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=836.68s)]
*  goons that we just heard from [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=843.0s)]
*  What criticized the Iran nuclear deal which was working in terms of constraining the Iran nuclear program? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=845.04s)]
*  And then we've tried their maximum trap pressure thing for years and it ends with Iran firing missiles at Israel and they're closer to getting [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=850.44s)]
*  A new thing they were ever before if Iran had fired missiles at [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=857.0400000000001s)]
*  Israel during the Iran nuclear deal they would have you know gone ballistic their policy failed, right? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=861.1600000000001s)]
*  This is where their policy leads to war and the politics of this thing is some of this is like the reflexive like well [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=865.6s)]
*  If I look tough on Iran, that's got a good politics [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=873.0s)]
*  Shouldn't they did did they not learn anything from Trump who has actually been pretty good at [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=875.96s)]
*  Triangulating off of this wing of the Republican Party and saying like I don't want to get into wars, you know [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=882.28s)]
*  And again, I don't think that Trump's policies actually reflect that because some of things he did contributed to the situation [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=886.16s)]
*  but I [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=892.64s)]
*  If I'm Biden, I wouldn't be afraid of this stuff [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=894.0s)]
*  I wouldn't either because Americans don't want to go to war with Iran. They don't want to be in a war with Iran [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=897.28s)]
*  That is very clear Donald Trump understands that right? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=901.68s)]
*  Yeah [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=904.2399999999999s)]
*  Which is why he didn't respond to that ballistic missile attack and also globally like you're hearing voices like the comments like Tom Cotton and John Bolton [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=904.4s)]
*  In Israel in their far, right? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=911.4s)]
*  You're also hearing them in the far right in the US but internationally like Rishi Sunak said to Parliament the Prime Minister of the UK [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=913.56s)]
*  We would urge them to take caution take the win at this point. So he's echoing the Biden's a good line [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=920.26s)]
*  You know, it's like yeah, yeah, cuz in the exchange, right? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=924.38s)]
*  They blew up an embassy and killed a bunch of RGC people and the Iranians fired a bunch of stocks and all got shut down [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=927.22s)]
*  So, you know what that that's fine. Like just back off. Yeah, Macron president of France saying we will do everything to avoid a conflagration [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=932.58s)]
*  That is to say an escalation the German foreign minister on a Beyerbach the the right to self-defense means fending off an attack [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=939.74s)]
*  She said retaliation is not a category in international law. So the entire world is saying take the win [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=945.92s)]
*  Cool your jets, but you have these right-wing zealots in the US and Israel demanding more and more more one [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=952.14s)]
*  I don't you know and you heard out of Israel even from you know, not just from Netanyahu or even the far-right people [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=957.24s)]
*  But from I think Benny Gantz like well, we have to respond [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=962.9s)]
*  Why like I don't know why? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=967.1s)]
*  war [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=969.82s)]
*  Like more war is the answer to any question in foreign policy like it's like Israel has [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=971.14s)]
*  Deterrence they have nuclear weapons, you know [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=977.94s)]
*  They have missile defenses they so you don't have to like pick a war to [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=980.92s)]
*  To show that you'll be able to fight back. I mean, it's just not the logic is out of out of joint [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=986.48s)]
*  I also wonder if they you know [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=992.38s)]
*  This is like the the cats out of the bag in terms of Israeli politics because you know [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=994.12s)]
*  They've been so hawkish in their in their rhetoric about Iran for years [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=998.44s)]
*  The Israelis wake up and read in the newspaper about you know covert efforts to kill Iranian scientists [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1002.08s)]
*  To take out their computer systems and centrifuges and things [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1008.56s)]
*  So now it's like you're hearing a lot of Israeli voices on the street [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1011.72s)]
*  You know blame who blame Iran for what Hamas did on October 7th and they're demanding [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1014.96s)]
*  Retribution inventions in a lot of ways and part of that is like an understandable feeling but it doesn't make it a smart policy [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1019.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, like you don't act on every feeling. No, you do not but as you mentioned, I mean the war in Gaza is still raging [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1024.6s)]
*  More aid may be getting into Gaza, but it's still insufficient [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1030.68s)]
*  And Israeli protesters are still regularly blocking a trucks from getting into Gaza for hours and hours at a time [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1033.8s)]
*  We reached out to Melanie Ward the CEO of an organization called Medical Aid for Palestinians about her recent trip to Gaza [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1039.8s)]
*  She was just there. Here is some of what she said about the aid process and what's getting in when I was on the way [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1047.1599999999999s)]
*  Actually on the way back from Gaza. I saw some of the items that have been rejected by Israeli court security [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1055.0s)]
*  Some of the humanitarian items [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1061.98s)]
*  This included a whole lot of different kinds of medical equipment such as an anesthesia machine an [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1064.54s)]
*  X-ray machine it included first aid kits [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1071.86s)]
*  bleach [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1074.9399999999998s)]
*  Included a box of wooden crutches a wheelchair [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1076.1399999999999s)]
*  It's included solar lamps and generators which you need when there's no electricity and when people are displaced and [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1079.58s)]
*  You know taking shelter under pieces of plastic on the ground [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1087.7s)]
*  and you need these things when [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1091.46s)]
*  Everything is in such a desperate state [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1094.26s)]
*  I also saw their sleeping bags which had been rejected [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1096.7800000000002s)]
*  They were rejected apparently because they were green and green is supposedly a military color. So I [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1101.5800000000002s)]
*  Don't know what kind of system [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1108.3000000000002s)]
*  Stops displaced people from having access to a sleeping bag because it's the wrong color [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1110.3000000000002s)]
*  But it's horrifying and this is where we are and for all the talk [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1114.38s)]
*  The situation on the ground remains disastrous [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1117.98s)]
*  Melanie also told us I mean she's someone who reads the news about what's happening in Gaza all day every day [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1121.14s)]
*  She's in touch with her staff on the ground all day every day [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1126.22s)]
*  She knows all the statistics has read all the stories [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1129.3400000000001s)]
*  But nothing she said can prepare you for actually seeing what it's like on the ground the humanitarian situation is intolerable [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1132.18s)]
*  Yeah, and there's just no justification. I mean Israel pre October 7th in their blockade of Gaza for you know, I [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1138.6200000000001s)]
*  Don't know 15 plus years now [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1145.9s)]
*  They claim that they restrict stuff from getting in that has dual use technology dual use purposes [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1147.9s)]
*  It could be used for military purpose what there was no military purpose for a sleeping bag or some crutches or [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1152.5800000000002s)]
*  Anesthesia like just think of how sick it is to not allow [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1160.38s)]
*  An aesthetic to get in you like just so what people can feel more pain [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1165.7800000000002s)]
*  Or to not allow crutches in I mean, what what is the logic? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1170.42s)]
*  What what is the logic what is the mindset of whoever is making that decision because it's it's fucked up, you know [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1173.86s)]
*  And and and as David Miliband said to us, this is an international legal requirement [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1180.4199999999998s)]
*  It's not a favor to let medical equipment in it is a legal obligation under international law to allow that kind of assistance to get in [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1185.62s)]
*  And and and despite, you know the promises that came out of that phone call with Netanyahu and Biden [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1193.34s)]
*  Clearly there's still these problems are with Damon. Who's a great reporter [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1199.4199999999998s)]
*  For CNN wrote a first-person account of her recent visit to Gaza and she talked about [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1203.98s)]
*  interviewing a doctor who told her a story about I think was a ten-year-old boy who died on the operating table having his leg [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1208.5s)]
*  Amputated without anesthesia, you know, it's just it was such horrific pain that he just died and there's just and we've talked about this Tommy, but [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1215.26s)]
*  International journalists have not gotten in there Palestinian journalists who've done a lot to bring this to people's attention [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1222.9399999999998s)]
*  Through social media or any platform and fine a lot of died [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1227.98s)]
*  I just think it's probably again worse than anybody can imagine once people get in there [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1231.22s)]
*  Like we said, the body counts probably worse because people are under the rubble and I think that the backdrop of this Iran exchange is [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1236.06s)]
*  There's no end in sight to the war in Gaza, you know [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1243.1799999999998s)]
*  I mean, I think we all there's kind of been this assumption at some point there'll be a ceasefire [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1245.72s)]
*  There'll be a deal for hostages. Well the the the combination of you know [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1250.3s)]
*  Hamas has been intransigent [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1256.82s)]
*  Israel you know killed the children and grandchildren of one of the Hamas leaders are negotiating with so that guy is probably not like a more inclined [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1259.22s)]
*  Maybe a little more dug in now. Yeah, the Iranians attacking in this back and forth probably hardens attitudes in Israel generally [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1266.6799999999998s)]
*  Because there's they obviously draw a linkage between [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1275.58s)]
*  You know Hamas and Iran as a financier of Hamas [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1278.54s)]
*  They're [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1283.06s)]
*  Remain committed to this Roth operation [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1285.14s)]
*  And so I think we have to adjust our thinking to the reality that it's possible that this war goes through the summer [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1287.06s)]
*  You know that there's not necessarily like some you know [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1292.78s)]
*  We're not on the precipice of a ceasefire and on top of that [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1296.38s)]
*  I mean there's reports today that Israel assassinated a senior Hezbollah commander in a strike in southern Lebanon [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1299.38s)]
*  And then has blow up his firing rockets in response [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1305.1s)]
*  So again like the the lid could pop off that there's violent clashes in the West Bank that are steadily increasing [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1307.52s)]
*  Dozens of Israelis and Palestinians were hurt over the weekend and fighting after a missing 14 year old Israeli boy was found dead [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1313.8s)]
*  An Israeli settlers shot and killed two Palestinians in the West Bank on Monday alone. The point is the war's not over [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1319.8799999999999s)]
*  It's not getting better every day the risk of escalation increases, but to your point [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1326.04s)]
*  I mean this Iran strike or attack on Israel seems to have stalled any momentum [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1330.8s)]
*  Behind conditioning USAID or using US leverage to help end the war instead [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1336.16s)]
*  We have Congress rushing more military funding to Israel [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1341.4s)]
*  So speaker Johnson wants to call votes on a whole bunch of new supplemental funding bills [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1344.24s)]
*  According to a document obtained by PBS NewsHour. He wants a vote on one bill that provides [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1349.08s)]
*  $48 billion for Ukraine another to provide 14 billion for Israel with no conditioning on that assistance [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1355.12s)]
*  2.4 billion for Red Sea operations, which I assume is like counter Houthi [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1361.16s)]
*  Strike yeah and probably just the additional cost of having the US military right posture and carriers there and so [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1365.76s)]
*  There's another bill or two maybe for like six billion dollars for Indo-Pacific stuff. There's some Taiwan money in there [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1371.88s)]
*  Yeah, they're Democrats want a vote on sending at least nine billion in humanitarian aid to Gaza [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1377.96s)]
*  So obviously we'd support that there might be a vote on a ban for on tik-tok. So it's very confusing [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1383.52s)]
*  It's also not clear Frankenstein [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1389.54s)]
*  Yeah [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1391.74s)]
*  And not clear speaker Johnson is gonna survive to get to a vote speaking of Frankenstein because he has right wingers like Marjorie Taylor [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1392.42s)]
*  Green he has Tom Massey both threatening to oust him through the motion to vacate process [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1399.34s)]
*  So then I mean I guess stepping back like how worried are you that Gaza could become an afterthought in Washington in particular as? [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1403.3799999999999s)]
*  Everyone focuses on Iran and like again [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1411.06s)]
*  Am I a paranoid freak to wonder if part of Netanyahu's plan all along was to take that strike in Damascus take out some IRGC [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1414.3s)]
*  Generals and see if you could make this an Iran Israel fight [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1421.58s)]
*  I gotta say that thought has been front of my mind for a few weeks now, you know, cuz he had to know [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1424.52s)]
*  If you bomb a Iranian embassy that they're gonna do something in response [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1431.82s)]
*  I mean, you know, he may not have known that they launched, you know hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel, but [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1435.94s)]
*  He'd much rather the focus be on Iran in Washington, you know than on Israel's operation Gaza [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1441.86s)]
*  And again, it really is absurd to me that you know when Jose Andres is mad [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1447.62s)]
*  People in Washington, they're suddenly want a condition aid and then a week later. It's like that's just memory hold, you know [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1453.6999999999998s)]
*  and the reality is even if you're taking the position that what we don't want to [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1459.5s)]
*  withdraw a military assistance Israel [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1465.2199999999998s)]
*  In the wake of this attack one of the things that's been on the table for a long time is [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1467.98s)]
*  Suspending the delivery of offensive weapons, right? [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1474.22s)]
*  So you could maybe keep providing Iron Dome support missile defense support purely defensive weapons [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1476.22s)]
*  But you don't need to give Israel a 2,000 pound bomb to defend itself against Iran [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1482.6999999999998s)]
*  Like that's being that's assistance to be used in an offensive military operation in Gaza [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1488.26s)]
*  The kind of thing that is causing all these civilian casualties [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1494.0400000000002s)]
*  So there's just no logic to to this shift other than the political conversation changed to Iran [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1497.1200000000001s)]
*  It also says something pretty weird about the United States as a country [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1504.3600000000001s)]
*  And again, this is on the Republicans not not this part is not on Joe Biden. They'd like [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1509.0s)]
*  Well, we'll sit for months on our hands in terms of providing support to a country Ukraine defending itself [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1514.2800000000002s)]
*  You know, but you know, we'll rush this assistance out the door to Israel as they're carrying out this kind of open-ended thing [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1521.26s)]
*  In Gaza like it just I don't know. Nobody comes out as looking great [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1530.54s)]
*  You know, we want to get to Ukraine in one second [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1534.76s)]
*  But but one last thing on on Israel and we haven't talked about him much on the show because he's mostly just an anti vaccine [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1536.76s)]
*  crank [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1544.02s)]
*  But if you guys have liberal or leftist friends who are into a Robert F Kennedy juniors campaign for some reason [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1544.7s)]
*  Just make sure they search his views on Gaza because he is far more hawkish than Joe Biden [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1551.8600000000001s)]
*  He these are some quotes. So Robert F RFK jr. Said that Israel quote does not have any choice except to eradicate Hamas [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1557.9s)]
*  He denied that there was a siege on the civilian population in Gaza even after the Israeli government announced it [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1565.04s)]
*  He said quote the Palestinian people are arguably the most pampered people by international aid organizations in the history of the world [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1571.9s)]
*  That's a direct quote. I transcribed it myself [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1578.3400000000001s)]
*  He opposes even a temporary ceasefire in Gaza in 2023 [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1580.98s)]
*  He said he opposed Biden getting back into the Iran nuclear agreement and he regurgitated all the Trump lines about like [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1585.54s)]
*  Palate to cash type stuff, even though he supported the deal back in 2015 [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1591.5s)]
*  So this guy is just like a political hack who is apparently super hawkish on foreign policy and willing [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1595.86s)]
*  To call the Palestinian people who have been in a dire humanitarian situation for 15 years now pampered [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1603.5s)]
*  Yeah, I mean the the the core points you make is it like we're gonna have a conversation [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1611.5s)]
*  I'm sure for the next few months about people who are like maybe [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1616.6599999999999s)]
*  I mean, I think there's a lot of reasons why I mean anybody listens podcast knows that you and I have had a lot of problems with the Biden policy [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1619.86s)]
*  But I frankly think that that's a bad idea [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1626.3s)]
*  You know, just educate yourself on the other I'm just to look at the other because you have an election is about choices, right? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1630.06s)]
*  And and this guy is not like a different option. I will say interestingly [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1635.46s)]
*  I wonder how many people are willing to vote for Biden [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1641.02s)]
*  I will say interestingly [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1644.5s)]
*  I [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1647.1000000000001s)]
*  Wonder how much his views on this are and it doesn't justify the view but you know Palestinian [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1648.5s)]
*  Assassinated his father, right? So that I'm just I don't know anything. I'm very I don't know what goes on in RFK jr's head [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1657.54s)]
*  Because what's weird is he's the only common thread because I've heard him give interviews about foreign policy and the only common thread is [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1668.02s)]
*  Kind of can it's same thing. It's like conspiracy theories. Yeah, and sometimes it's like so far left [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1673.6200000000001s)]
*  You can't see it. Sometimes as far right you can't see it. Like this is not the guy you want to [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1679.54s)]
*  Launch her, you know, no to know [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1684.38s)]
*  so let's get to your crane point because the the fact that [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1686.9s)]
*  The US and other Western allies directly interviewing to intercept these attacks on Israel [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1690.78s)]
*  But not it did not do that for Ukraine has not been lost on President Zelensky [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1695.96s)]
*  He tweeted a long message that said in part and these are quotes the entire world witnessed allied action in the skies above Israel and neighboring [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1700.1799999999998s)]
*  Countries it demonstrated how truly effective unity and defending against terror can be when it is based on sufficient political will [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1706.62s)]
*  Israel is not a NATO member [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1713.06s)]
*  So no action such as triggering article 5 was required [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1714.54s)]
*  European skies could have received the same level of protection long ago if Ukraine had received similar full support from its partners in [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1717.74s)]
*  Intercepting drones and missiles terror must be defeated completely and everywhere not more in some places and less in others [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1724.3000000000002s)]
*  It's part of a long statement [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1730.7800000000002s)]
*  He put out so Ben Ukraine's permanent representative to the UN said that Russia has fired a thousand missiles [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1732.14s)]
*  2,800 drones and 7,000 guided aerial bombs at Ukraine since the start of the war [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1738.38s)]
*  According to a report in Politico Ukraine's success rate in shooting down Russian missiles and drones has gone from 90% to 46% [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1743.3000000000002s)]
*  More recently, they're just like running out of interceptors [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1750.5s)]
*  The Washington Post reported that back in February Vice President Kamala Harris told Zelensky to stop attacking Russian oil infrastructure [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1753.54s)]
*  Because the Biden administration was worried it would jack up global energy prices [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1761.66s)]
*  The post said that message did not go over well. Yeah in Ukraine and said double down on those attacks [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1766.54s)]
*  So Ben like as long as keys anger here totally understandable. Totally understand [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1771.9s)]
*  It's also a fact that Russia has nukes that can hit the US [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1775.46s)]
*  Iran does not which by the way is why the JCPO is [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1779.06s)]
*  JCPOA was a good idea to prevent Iran getting nuclear weapon [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1782.54s)]
*  But what do you make of the argument from Zelensky here? [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1785.78s)]
*  And do you think it's likely to prod countries to do more to support him or are you hearing anything out of Washington that gives? [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1788.06s)]
*  You hope that supplemental funding bill for Ukraine might pass. I [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1793.8999999999999s)]
*  think that you know, I [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1797.06s)]
*  Am entirely sympathetic to Zelensky here. I don't think that the US [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1799.58s)]
*  Like and we talked away back when about things like a US enforced no-fly zone [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1805.34s)]
*  The US getting involved in a direct military confrontation with Russia even in a defensive manner is [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1810.54s)]
*  Just you know, that's a huge risk. It's intolerable escalation job one [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1818.1s)]
*  job one for foreign policy is to not have World War three happen, you know, and [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1823.6s)]
*  And so I understand the US residents there, but big but here where I agree with Zelensky [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1828.02s)]
*  Why are we not providing far more air defense systems to the Ukrainians? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1832.68s)]
*  It should stands to reason that if like that's the kind of thing we should be [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1838.2800000000002s)]
*  Dramatically ramping up in terms of our provision of the Ukrainians. I'm sure that you know, some of that is in the sup [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1843.2s)]
*  So it's that again, that's not by the critique of Biden. That's a critique of Republicans holding this up [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1848.48s)]
*  Why would you not want to get these people? [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1853.9s)]
*  Patriots and air defense systems and and whatever they need to shoot down drones [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1856.1200000000001s)]
*  Like we should be giving them all of that stuff because even if you're someone who's like, I'm a little uncomfortable [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1859.84s)]
*  Kind of a perpetuating the war on the front line. It's just getting people killed that and that's a good argument [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1864.1999999999998s)]
*  You know, you can make an argument both ways on that because you can also say [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1870.4399999999998s)]
*  You have to fortify Ukraine give them enough weapons so that they can be in a negotiation with Russia in a stronger position [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1874.48s)]
*  Even if that's your view though, you should want to give them these defensive systems [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1880.12s)]
*  And so that's a no-brainer and I do think there's something there's an interesting frustration [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1883.3999999999999s)]
*  I've seen in Zelensky's messaging recently where he's willing to criticize the US [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1888.54s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it's always been a bit but I totally get it like oh [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1893.0s)]
*  Joe Biden I get you don't want to oil prices a little higher in your election year. Really? We want to survive, you know [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1898.18s)]
*  Yeah, that's tough. That's tough. And similarly he's been willing to go after Republicans more [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1903.5s)]
*  Which takes a lot of guts because Trump is the guy holding up this supplemental and so [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1908.46s)]
*  Zelensky seems like he doesn't have a problem [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1913.74s)]
*  Necessarily going there and calling out Republican and transients even though that Republican and transients is being [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1916.22s)]
*  You know mainly driven by someone who could be president. Yeah, it's got it's a really tough political situation to be in for him [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1923.22s)]
*  And by the way [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1928.5s)]
*  Foreign Affairs magazine it might have run today or this week this really interesting piece about why and how the early peace talks between [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1930.5s)]
*  Ukraine and Russia broke down [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1936.3s)]
*  The talks have these were the first weeks and months of the war. There were a lot of parties involved [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1938.3s)]
*  There were a lot of parties involved [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1943.3s)]
*  There's a lot of different opinions on what happened and what broke down [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1944.74s)]
*  But the gist seems to be that while various versions of a draft agreement between the parties [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1947.5s)]
*  Guaranteed that Ukraine wouldn't join NATO or have nuclear weapons. There was some language in there [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1953.86s)]
*  requiring the countries that were supposed to be the guarantors of this agreement to [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1960.26s)]
*  Directly intervene if there was some sort of invasion so the US would have to come to [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1965.1s)]
*  Ukraine's defense if Russia invaded which I don't think most Western countries were ready to agree to [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1969.62s)]
*  There was also the fact that the talks were as the talks were ongoing the Russians withdrew from the northern [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1975.26s)]
*  Vector of invasion right they withdrew from their attempt to invade from Belarus that exposed all the war crimes that had happened in places [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1981.7s)]
*  Like Buchad it hardened opinion in Ukraine [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1988.3s)]
*  And I think everybody just didn't trust Putin at that point because obviously he had been saying no no no [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1990.82s)]
*  I'm not gonna invade Ukraine and then he did but again [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1995.6399999999999s)]
*  This is another area where you sort of alluded to this Robert of Kennedy jr. Is [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=1998.52s)]
*  Either a liar or living on a different planet. Oh this one. He's totally crazy [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2002.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's recently his March [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2006.8799999999999s)]
*  He said Putin was about was withdrawing his troops when Biden sent Boris Johnson over to tear up [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2008.36s)]
*  This proposed peace agreement because Biden's real goal was to expand NATO into Ukraine [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2015.36s)]
*  Like that is just nuts and the opposite of that reporting right because the US was reticent to give that security guarantee [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2021.0s)]
*  You know I think that it'll be very interesting [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2028.16s)]
*  to kind of [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2030.72s)]
*  Learn the whole history of what happened in those early weeks and whether there truly was an opportunity [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2031.92s)]
*  To reach some kind of deal or whether it was just there were some talks and some formulations be passed back and forth [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2037.0800000000002s)]
*  We don't know [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2042.68s)]
*  But yeah, it's suffice to say it wasn't you know Boris Johnson [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2044.48s)]
*  Killing killing peace deals on behalf of I mean there was an emissary Boris Johnson. Well, yeah, yeah [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2048.84s)]
*  I mean they yeah that that didn't happen. I mean I do think like we should [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2054.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, I I did what a day a great podcast, you know people want a daily dose of correct [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2059.8s)]
*  and I got a great question, which is like, you know, hey [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2065.84s)]
*  seems like World War three is uncomfortably close here, you know and [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2070.68s)]
*  We need to take this seriously right you got you got an actual war in in Ukraine you've got a [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2074.3599999999997s)]
*  War in the Middle East and that could escalate substantially. You've got you know, China could have Taiwan contingencies [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2081.2s)]
*  we do need some diplomacy here, you know, and [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2088.8399999999997s)]
*  The one lesson I would take is it even in the hardest possible circumstances like the early weeks and I'm not suggesting [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2092.56s)]
*  I don't know. I'm not suggesting the Biden team could have like pulled some diplomatic rabbit out of a hat [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2098.12s)]
*  I'm just saying like going like let's say something flares up in Taiwan. Like I hope [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2102.66s)]
*  It's not like a momentum towards conflict. It's like how do we get the hell out of this becoming a war? [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2107.68s)]
*  You know, like we need to start being really aggressive [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2112.66s)]
*  Precisely because we are uncomfortably close to World War three [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2116.14s)]
*  Now is the time to really be dialing up? [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2119.74s)]
*  The diplomacy here. Yeah, both sides think that the only way to restore deterrence is one last attack. Yeah, it's not a great place [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2122.54s)]
*  Yeah, everybody thinks they're gonna have the last attack that restores deterrence [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2128.46s)]
*  And now we're going to times the deterrence is just not having the war in the first place. Yeah, that'd be nice [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2131.62s)]
*  Okay, Ben, let's turn to Sudan because Monday April 15th marked a grim anniversary in Sudan [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2137.0s)]
*  It's the one-year anniversary of the Civil War and with so much focus on Gaza and Ukraine [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2143.0s)]
*  It is important to remember that one of the worst conflicts in the world is only getting worse [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2147.82s)]
*  So some quick stats in the last year according to the United Nations humanitarian agencies [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2152.12s)]
*  More than 8 million people have fled their homes at least 14,000 people have been killed in Sudan [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2156.9399999999996s)]
*  I'm sure that number is much higher because there's so little information getting in and out [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2162.22s)]
*  25 million people roughly half the population of Sudan require humanitarian assistance and save the children warns that [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2166.58s)]
*  230,000 more children pregnant women and new mothers could die in the coming months due to hunger [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2173.8999999999996s)]
*  So this Civil War broke out a year ago [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2178.2599999999998s)]
*  When two generals who were once allied began this bitter power struggle that power struggle has evolved into a broader proxy war [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2181.22s)]
*  So you have Sudan's military which is commanded by General Abdul Fattah al-Burnham [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2188.5s)]
*  He is backed by Saudi Arabia Turkey Egypt Ukraine and Iran [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2192.58s)]
*  And then you have the paramilitary group the Rapid Support Forces or RSF. It's led by a general most commonly known as Hamati [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2196.5s)]
*  He gets support and weapons from the UAE and from the Wagner mercenary group in Russia our old buddies [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2203.1s)]
*  On Monday [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2208.7400000000002s)]
*  58 countries at this conference in Paris pledged 2.1 billion dollars in humanitarian aid to Sudan that is just nowhere near enough [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2210.26s)]
*  And as French President Emmanuel Macron noted the humanitarian relief money raised by this conference is probably less than what's been spent by the various powers [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2217.5800000000004s)]
*  Fighting the proxy war in Sudan already so combined we spoke with Jada doyan McKenna the CEO of mercy corps an organization [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2225.7000000000003s)]
*  That has been providing support in Sudan since 2004 [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2233.1200000000003s)]
*  Here's a clip of what she makes of this donor conference and its successes after yesterday's international pledging conference [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2235.46s)]
*  We are still facing a shortfall of approximately [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2242.7000000000003s)]
*  2 billion dollars to respond to the urgent needs of the Sudanese people and to provide [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2245.94s)]
*  Life-sustaining essentials like food and shelter the 2.1 billion dollars that has been pledged [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2252.94s)]
*  Represents just 20 cents per day for each person in dire need of assistance [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2258.66s)]
*  It is extremely concerning and quite frankly a moral outrage [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2263.62s)]
*  That despite famine warnings world leaders have pledged barely half of the funds needed to save lives [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2267.94s)]
*  So the the crisis in Sudan is also [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2274.34s)]
*  Destabilizing neighboring countries like Chad South Sudan and Egypt which have to manage these unsustainable refugee flows and build these huge camps for people [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2277.18s)]
*  So, you know first of all shout out to mercy corps and these organizations for the life-saving work they're doing [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2285.14s)]
*  But then I mean a couple weeks back [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2290.42s)]
*  We talked about Sudan and I reached out to a buddy [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2292.58s)]
*  Who was one of the leaders of the saved our for movement back in the early 2000s? [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2295.14s)]
*  Just to say like is there anything similar happening is anyone standing up a similar organization? [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2298.58s)]
*  To try to do something outside of government and his answer was basically no and while saved our for obviously didn't [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2304.54s)]
*  Prevent the genocide from happening in Darfur [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2312.8999999999996s)]
*  It at least was this global movement to raise awareness and force governments to respond to take some sort of action [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2316.02s)]
*  And now that's just that doesn't even exist and it's just you know, it left me wondering like what happened [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2321.8599999999997s)]
*  How did this just completely fall apart? [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2327.14s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's because [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2329.46s)]
*  The breakdown I mean part of it just like the world is crazier and there's more stuff going on and things that would normally get [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2332.58s)]
*  You know normally would have gotten attention in the 90s or early aughts, you know, or just getting drowned out [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2339.3s)]
*  But another big piece of this is the degree to which the international order has collapsed. It doesn't really exist anymore. You know the [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2346.26s)]
*  You mentioned the the nation's providing support on both sides of this like the whole world is like a you know [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2353.62s)]
*  series of proxy wars taking place and [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2359.7000000000003s)]
*  You know back in the day, you know, even in the obama years like [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2362.5s)]
*  We dealt with sudan south sudan through the un security council like that's a joke now [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2366.2599999999998s)]
*  Like you can't get anything done for your own security council because russia and china and the u.s [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2370.58s)]
*  Don't agree on anything and so then it becomes this kind of [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2374.4199999999996s)]
*  You know everybody's backing their warlord and and again, I I don't think you have [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2377.62s)]
*  No, I don't think I know you don't have a civil war like this in sudan absent these external powers like arming different sides [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2382.58s)]
*  Oh, no doubt. Yeah, and so that's the problem. The problem is sure some of it's in sudan [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2388.74s)]
*  But if you if you could adjust the wiring of of these countries providing a support you could you could have a shot [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2393.38s)]
*  At ending this thing pretty quickly, you know [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2400.34s)]
*  So that's the first point [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2403.38s)]
*  And this is where you think we'd have some leverage like to call the uae and say stop sending weapons to the rsf [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2405.2200000000003s)]
*  Well, that's yeah, that's paramilitary force and that's the that where the u.s [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2410.1800000000003s)]
*  Could focus more attention and there's a very good envoy and tom perriello now trying to do this [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2413.38s)]
*  But and to the point about the uae like guess who has two billion dollars, you know [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2419.06s)]
*  Like like if the uae was spending that money trying to avert a famine and ultimately it's in their interest because I don't think [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2423.46s)]
*  It helps to have this degree of of mass suffering and disorder across all of north africa [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2429.06s)]
*  Like we're seeing that that begets other problems it begets insurgencies terrorism obviously above all [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2434.98s)]
*  famine and humanitarian suffering [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2441.2999999999997s)]
*  And again, you know the we just talked about the u.s. You know [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2444.66s)]
*  Trying to shovel, you know [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2448.02s)]
*  14 billion dollars out the door and israeli assistance and I guarantee you couldn't squeeze probably a few hundred million dollars at the door for [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2449.7000000000003s)]
*  us id for sudan, I mean we need [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2456.5800000000004s)]
*  Different priorities frankly the world needs different priorities america needs different priorities. And and again, that's you know, that's more about congress and the biden administration [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2459.94s)]
*  That's just you know [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2466.9s)]
*  What what what you can get? Yeah, it's amazing what uh, how quickly congress will move to buy more weapons. Yeah [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2468.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it's very uh, very depressing. Yeah [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2474.1800000000003s)]
*  Uh, okay speaking of depressing stories, so sad one out of australia ben we're on saturday [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2476.66s)]
*  In bondi junction in sydney one of the country's deadliest mass killings in decades took place when a man with a knife entered a shopping mall [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2480.98s)]
*  And stabbed 18 people leaving six dead all but two of the victims were women including a nine-month-old baby girl [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2487.94s)]
*  So this 40 year old attacker reportedly had a long history of mental illness [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2495.06s)]
*  Police commissioner karen webb was asked at a press conference if the attacker singled out women to which she replied quote [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2498.8999999999996s)]
*  I think everyone's seeing that footage can see that for themselves. So these guys were just targeting women [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2504.98s)]
*  One male the one male victim who died was a security guard [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2510.1s)]
*  He was working his first shift at the mall and he lost his life while trying to intervene and save people [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2513.46s)]
*  24 hours before this attack [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2518.82s)]
*  Hundreds of people gathered for a rally just outside melbourne calling for action on violence against women after months of high-profile murders involving female victims [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2520.5s)]
*  One activist who spoke at the rally provided some statistics regarding violence against women in australia [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2528.9s)]
*  Uh, they were as follows one in two women have experienced sexual harassment one in three women have experienced violence since the age of 15 [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2534.42s)]
*  One in four australian women have experienced intimate partner violence since 15 one in five women [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2540.98s)]
*  In australia have experienced sexual violence since the age of 15 [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2546.2599999999998s)]
*  So the the father of the mall attacker contacted police when he heard the news [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2549.78s)]
*  And he had this to say to the media. I'm extremely sorry. I'm heartbreaking for you [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2554.82s)]
*  I look this is so horrendous that I can't even explain it [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2560.34s)]
*  You're trying to give me to give you an intelligent conversation [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2564.82s)]
*  I can't do it because i'm just devastated [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2569.2200000000003s)]
*  I love my son. I made myself a servant to my son when I found out he had a mental illness [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2572.26s)]
*  I became his servant. I did everything because I love that boy. This is a parent's [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2578.1s)]
*  Absolute nightmare when they have a child with mental illness that something like this would happen [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2583.2000000000003s)]
*  And my heart goes out to the people our son has hurt [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2588.74s)]
*  Just devastating. Um, so the attack finally ended when a female police officer named amy scott shot the attacker dead [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2591.7799999999997s)]
*  Uh, so look we just wanted to raise it to send some some love to our listeners and friends in australia [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2598.66s)]
*  Because it's scary stuff and also just it's pretty dark man that like one of my initial thoughts when I heard this story was [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2603.8599999999997s)]
*  Thank god this didn't happen in america because that guy would have had a gun [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2610.18s)]
*  Yeah, and it would have been even worse. I'm not i'm not saying like you know what I mean? [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2613.22s)]
*  I'm just like glad australia has actual gun laws that prevented this guy seemingly from getting one [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2616.82s)]
*  Well, yeah, they have actually really strong gun laws and and that that has really driven down gun violence [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2620.9s)]
*  I mean, I I mentioned you tommy like I heard some from some listeners in australia [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2625.6200000000003s)]
*  about this violence against women piece of it and [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2630.1000000000004s)]
*  um, I did a similar dive into the kind of statistics which are really jarring [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2633.86s)]
*  And even if this guy has mental illness and I don't you can't get in someone's head in any case [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2639.06s)]
*  But if you're in a society that is kind of too tolerant of this of violence against women [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2645.3s)]
*  You know, it does kind of open the door to people taking that to extremes, you know [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2652.82s)]
*  and I think it raises the bar on societies like in australia to to really take a [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2657.1400000000003s)]
*  concerted across the board effort to try to get at the root causes of violence against women which we've seen by the way [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2662.32s)]
*  in too many places like [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2667.86s)]
*  You just talked about australia india's had all these problems over the years where you've seen periodic [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2669.78s)]
*  Uprisings essentially people being like what you guys you know, they're they're awful sexual assaults that sometimes happen in public the uk [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2675.28s)]
*  There have been issues over the years of of women feeling like there was a kind of normalization of people being harassed in the us [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2681.38s)]
*  Obviously even by police, but yeah police in the uk and obviously the us has had, you know [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2686.82s)]
*  The me too movement and all kinds. So I do think that this is the the most jarring reminder that [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2691.5400000000004s)]
*  Um [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2697.2200000000003s)]
*  you know that even in [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2698.42s)]
*  I know relatively [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2700.98s)]
*  Non-violent, you know advanced democracies [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2703.54s)]
*  You can't ignore you can't allow these kinds of issues to just fester [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2707.06s)]
*  You know, I think violence against women is is a really high indicator that someone might commit homicide. Yeah. Yeah exactly [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2710.26s)]
*  I'll see a partner [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2716.34s)]
*  There was also a really scary incident in australia on monday where there was a bishop at a church [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2717.46s)]
*  Yeah, that was crazy while getting a sermon it was live streamed [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2722.1s)]
*  Yeah, apparently it was a the the cop said it was a terrorist attack by a religious extremist [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2724.74s)]
*  But I don't didn't see more than that [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2728.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it seemed to be something to do with the this particular church. But uh, yeah rough, you know [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2731.14s)]
*  Horrible horrible two more quick things where we get the interview [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2737.22s)]
*  So a quick update on a story we covered when it broke which is [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2739.7s)]
*  The former us ambassador a former us ambassador named manuel rocha was sentenced to 15 years in prison on friday [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2743.22s)]
*  Rocha pleaded guilty to acting as a secret agent for the cuban government for up to 40 years [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2749.2999999999997s)]
*  He worked in top jobs at the state department at the white house on the national security staff in the mid 90s [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2754.2599999999998s)]
*  He was even the us ambassador to bolivia. So very senior guy [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2759.86s)]
*  Rocha's indictment says he was recruited by cuban intelligence while visiting chile in [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2763.94s)]
*  1973 so right after graduating from college. Yeah, so these cuban intel guys they were playing a long game man [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2769.04s)]
*  He wasn't a citizen yet. I don't think and he joined the state department in 1981 [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2774.82s)]
*  So they got him early. So rocha left the state department in 2002. I watched the movie of this one [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2779.06s)]
*  I would watch this movie too. Uh, he later worked [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2783.7s)]
*  As an advisor to us southern command from like I think oh six to 2012 [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2786.9s)]
*  So again, he stayed in government stayed focused on [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2790.58s)]
*  Uh us entities did manage cuba [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2793.7799999999997s)]
*  he uh also apparently stayed loyal to the cuban government because [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2797.22s)]
*  In 2022 in 2023 the fbi did this sting operation [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2801.22s)]
*  Where they sent someone undercover to contact rocha and he started bragging about his accomplishments and loyalty to cuba [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2805.86s)]
*  The associated press reported that a cuban defector tipped off a former cia officer about rocha as far back as 2006 [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2812.26s)]
*  But it sounds like they just dropped the ball. So great job bush administration [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2820.34s)]
*  It is not clear if rocha is fully cooperating about all that he did and knows but [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=2824.7400000000002s)]

*  We're gonna talk about what happens after the war in gaza stops and how you reconstruct the gaza strip [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3373.62s)]
*  And how you build a political process going forward so stick around for that [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3380.34s)]
*  My guest today is halil gindi [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3384.02s)]
*  He is a senior fellow and director of program on palestine and the palestinian israeli affairs at the middle east institute [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3385.62s)]
*  He's also the author of the excellent book blind spot [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3392.2599999999998s)]
*  America and the palestinians from balfour to trump great to see you. Thank you for doing the show. Yeah. Thanks for having me back [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3396.16s)]
*  so, um [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3403.14s)]
*  It has been six months of this nightmare of a war in gaza [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3404.3399999999997s)]
*  Eventually, it will have to end [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3409.8599999999997s)]
*  And you know as as awful as the war has been I think [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3412.42s)]
*  Things will get even harder after so we wanted to talk about that today [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3416.26s)]
*  And just sort of get you know, you've done a lot of great writing [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3420.1s)]
*  About this, but I want to get your sense of of what will be required [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3423.06s)]
*  for [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3427.46s)]
*  Reconstruction and governance going forward. It's hard to know really where to start on the question of reconstruction and governance [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3428.6400000000003s)]
*  Um, you know in the past whenever there have been [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3436.6600000000003s)]
*  Wars long and short, you know, the shortest was maybe a few days and then the longest was like 51 days [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3440.02s)]
*  Before now so we've never seen anything like this in terms of the scale of destruction [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3446.4199999999996s)]
*  um, I know the world bank is putting the reconstruction figure at around [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3451.7s)]
*  18 and a half billion, uh, which is [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3457.8599999999997s)]
*  To me sounds very very modest and I think it relates only to things like housing [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3461.14s)]
*  because about [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3467.14s)]
*  60 to 70 percent of the housing stock has been [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3468.88s)]
*  Destroyed or at least enough to be unlivable [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3472.7400000000002s)]
*  So [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3477.7000000000003s)]
*  Probably a safer estimate [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3479.6200000000003s)]
*  Would would be like a hundred billion for for everything because you have to rebuild hospitals and roads and [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3482.82s)]
*  Sewage lines and all kinds of infrastructure that was civilian infrastructure that was just deliberately destroyed [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3489.46s)]
*  And in the meantime what happens right? How does gaza be a livable place? So it's it's a kind of [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3497.3199999999997s)]
*  it's a question that that I don't have an answer to because you have a [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3505.7999999999997s)]
*  a place a small densely packed populated [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3510.2799999999997s)]
*  space where virtually all of the schools [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3515.08s)]
*  Most of the hospitals of all [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3519.3199999999997s)]
*  Uh, or at least five of the seven major universities have been completely destroyed in addition to [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3522.68s)]
*  as we said [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3528.6s)]
*  more than you know around two-thirds of the housing stock, so [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3529.9599999999996s)]
*  How do you live in a place that doesn't have these kind of basic services and functions in the meantime as it's being [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3535.08s)]
*  Rebuilt right? So even if you could if you could [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3542.58s)]
*  Locate those resources [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3545.72s)]
*  How how do people live there? [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3548.2s)]
*  um, and my fear and I think the fear of a lot of people is that [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3550.4399999999996s)]
*  They won't over time. We'll see people [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3555.3199999999997s)]
*  You know, maybe trickling out [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3558.8399999999997s)]
*  Uh at first but then eventually you might see a mass exodus [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3560.9199999999996s)]
*  over the next five to ten years because people need [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3565.64s)]
*  To educate their kids people need work people need hospitals [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3569.56s)]
*  um, so [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3574.04s)]
*  I don't know. Yeah, I don't know how you deal with the the reconstruction part [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3576.44s)]
*  That's on the technical side on the political side [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3582.52s)]
*  It's even harder because where the u.s and the europeans and maybe the arab states are with regard to gaza's [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3586.04s)]
*  Reconstruction and rehabilitation is not at all [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3594.02s)]
*  Where the israeli government is? Yeah [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3597.0s)]
*  And and so that huge gap [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3600.2799999999997s)]
*  Is going to work in the favor of the parties that are on the ground namely the israelis [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3603.0800000000004s)]
*  The israelis don't care about reconstruction. They don't care about anyone's security [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3607.8s)]
*  But their own [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3613.32s)]
*  And and so they're not looking at long-term governance in the in traditional terms [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3615.0s)]
*  They're looking at who can we recruit now that serves our immediate interests? [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3620.1200000000003s)]
*  Including so they don't even trust the humanitarian aid groups [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3625.94s)]
*  um, and so they're looking to [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3629.6400000000003s)]
*  To cultivate a different kind of leadership [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3632.36s)]
*  Uh that is more parochial, you know business leaders heads of clans [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3635.4s)]
*  Uh, maybe gangs and warlords at some point [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3640.44s)]
*  um, and so we have two completely different visions for [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3643.96s)]
*  for gaza's [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3648.76s)]
*  Short and medium-term future and I don't know how those get reconciled [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3650.52s)]
*  Yeah, and even just on the reconstruction point. I mean there's a conversation happening right now about were the israelis to [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3654.76s)]
*  Launch a ground invasion into rafa, which we all hope they will not do [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3662.28s)]
*  They would need to move a whole bunch of civilians into another part of the country, but [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3666.1200000000003s)]
*  These areas are littered with unexploded ordinance. I mean these these continue to be kill zones [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3671.0s)]
*  Regardless of whether they're being actively bombed. So I just I don't know how any of this works [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3676.84s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know how any of it works either. I mean the the deconfliction process or what what passes for deconfliction? [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3681.4s)]
*  Over the past six months hasn't worked right and we as we saw the most recently with the world central kitchen [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3689.26s)]
*  Uh attack on the on their convoy [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3696.54s)]
*  This was a deconflicted area. Um, the israelis had their exact coordinates [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3699.5s)]
*  Um, and yet they were still targeted [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3705.18s)]
*  Uh quite precisely, you know three in a row three hits in a row [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3708.14s)]
*  um [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3713.1s)]
*  And and we we've seen this from the very beginning, you know when palestinians were first told to evacuate the north [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3714.14s)]
*  And they were told, you know, we have to follow this route and only this route and you'll be safe and those same routes [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3721.58s)]
*  We're also being bombed [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3728.14s)]
*  So the track record of deconfliction [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3730.62s)]
*  um of of providing [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3733.98s)]
*  Safe spaces for civilians. It just isn't there [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3736.8599999999997s)]
*  Um, and it's I think it's clear to everyone who's paying attention that it's not [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3740.2999999999997s)]
*  It's not because the israelis don't have the capability [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3745.9s)]
*  It's that it's just not a priority to to protect civilians. Um, you know, they're [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3749.58s)]
*  Uh, I i've I just I keep hearing horror story after horror story of people who are [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3756.22s)]
*  Told to escape only to find that in the exact [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3762.7s)]
*  Uh route when they follow the exact instructions, they're still in many cases being fired on so [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3767.1s)]
*  Yeah, I just I don't know how it happens and I don't know where you put them [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3773.66s)]
*  inside gaza [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3778.06s)]
*  um [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3779.9s)]
*  And I think the fear is that they will be [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3781.2599999999998s)]
*  pushed [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3785.02s)]
*  Outside of gaza into egypt, you know because it's [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3785.9s)]
*  You know rafah is right there on the egyptian border, right? I agree. It does seem like that will be harder [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3789.18s)]
*  I mean you talked about there's this huge disconnect between what the united states is talking about which is empowering the palestinian authority [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3794.62s)]
*  And asking them to take the lead in gaza [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3801.5s)]
*  The israelis as you mentioned [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3804.38s)]
*  Don't like that plan. They want to go a different route, but there's also reports more importantly in my opinion [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3806.38s)]
*  of tensions between [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3811.98s)]
*  hamas and fatah [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3813.58s)]
*  Uh, this for the lead palestinian parties [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3815.8199999999997s)]
*  And it all calls into question [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3819.1s)]
*  how to find [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3821.3399999999997s)]
*  Some sort of single unified palestinian leadership that could take the lead [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3823.1s)]
*  On giving palestinians a voice in these processes going forward at a voice in reconstruction [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3827.9s)]
*  Are you seeing any process emerge or any leaders emerge that you think might kind of be the generation or or process for which? [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3832.7s)]
*  These you know this political challenge gets sorted out [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3841.9s)]
*  Sadly, I don't [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3845.98s)]
*  um [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3847.58s)]
*  I think there are there are huge gaps [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3848.94s)]
*  Uh across the board [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3851.8999999999996s)]
*  between [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3853.8199999999997s)]
*  Israelis and the the u.s obviously between israelis and palestinians among palestinians [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3854.8599999999997s)]
*  Probably within the two factions within fatah there [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3860.3799999999997s)]
*  there are [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3864.62s)]
*  different visions within hamas you have [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3865.58s)]
*  Different factions, you know, you have a leadership that is based outside of gaza in doha you have [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3869.18s)]
*  Obviously yahya sinwar inside and his immediate [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3875.66s)]
*  Um circle of leadership [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3879.7400000000002s)]
*  Uh, and you have you know, you have uh others in the diaspora in lebanon for example, so [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3882.6200000000003s)]
*  Um, are they on the same page? It's not it's not clear that they are. Yeah, I think part of the problem [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3890.38s)]
*  Has been the kind of zero-sum thinking on all sides obviously when you have massive [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3898.1400000000003s)]
*  death [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3904.86s)]
*  People, you know people kind of retreat to these very absolutist [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3906.3s)]
*  Ideas and visions and and zero sum certainly that was true of the israelis [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3911.98s)]
*  Early on and and hamas as well. That's to be expected [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3919.26s)]
*  Um, I think what was missing? [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3923.7400000000002s)]
*  Um was for a responsible third-party actor to emerge to say [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3926.94s)]
*  Um who could not think in zero-sum terms and think in much more reasonable terms about what is [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3932.86s)]
*  Feasible and what isn't and what's necessary? [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3941.02s)]
*  Uh, and the united states should have been that party, but but they weren't they sort of bought into the the zero-sum [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3944.14s)]
*  calculations, uh that the israelis were were [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3952.2000000000003s)]
*  Pushing out there and that is hamas has to be completely destroyed as a military movement and politically as a governing [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3955.74s)]
*  force [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3963.8199999999997s)]
*  Um, that was never achievable and it was always untenable [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3964.94s)]
*  And so I I think it was quite reckless for the united states to buy into that early on [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3968.7799999999997s)]
*  Even though they kind of hedged and moved away from that kind of rhetoric [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3975.42s)]
*  But in a lot of ways, it's it's too late [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3981.66s)]
*  and and so [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3985.58s)]
*  Also, I think another mistake was [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3987.9s)]
*  giving the unconditional full-throated [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3990.94s)]
*  support for israel's war aims [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3994.54s)]
*  Before israel had had articulated a plan, you know, here we are six months into this and we still don't know what the israeli [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=3997.42s)]
*  Plan is. I mean they [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4004.86s)]
*  Netanyahu has put out his ideas, but they're all non-starter ideas [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4006.92s)]
*  And they're not it's not a real plan for gaza [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4012.1400000000003s)]
*  It's just something that they could you know, check the box and say [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4015.82s)]
*  Here you go, washington. We've we this is our vision [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4019.9s)]
*  But I think it was a mistake to give such [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4024.2200000000003s)]
*  Unconditional support without knowing what the end game was and so here we are six months in and we still don't know [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4027.32s)]
*  What everybody's end game? [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4036.3s)]
*  Uh, you know something has to give hamas is going to have to be [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4038.54s)]
*  Incorporated into the palestinian body politic in one form or another people will have to come to terms with [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4045.32s)]
*  That reality if you cannot accept that reality that is a recipe for endless war [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4052.94s)]
*  And and death and destruction so there's just things that we don't like that [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4059.5s)]
*  We have to accept in the world and and that is one of them hamas will not be eliminated [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4063.74s)]
*  And the corollary to that is well then therefore [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4070.06s)]
*  It will have to be incorporated into politics in some way within the internal palestinian body politic [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4073.58s)]
*  um [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4081.4199999999996s)]
*  And I think that's where the gap is. Yeah, I mean look even channel 12 news in israel reported that [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4082.54s)]
*  uh israeli military intelligence assesses that hamas will exist as a guerrilla group as a terrorist group [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4087.58s)]
*  After the war, so I think [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4093.8999999999996s)]
*  Everyone agrees with what you're saying. Yeah, but it's more than just a guerrilla group, right? It's a political group [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4096.219999999999s)]
*  Well, it's an idea and resistance occupation. Yeah, yeah [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4101.66s)]
*  But and then they have an ideology and they have a base so they have a constituency, you know [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4104.78s)]
*  they have they have their support and and and so I mean it's a political movement before it's even a military or a guerrilla [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4108.7s)]
*  Right, so you were an advisor to the palestinian leadership. You were part of the anapolis negotiations. Um [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4117.179999999999s)]
*  You have probably heard a lot of uh, empty rhetoric [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4123.74s)]
*  About the middle east peace process from western leaders. You've seen a lot of failed efforts [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4126.54s)]
*  I mean i'm asking you to overgeneralize here, but i'm just wondering, you know, clearly there is this underlying [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4130.0599999999995s)]
*  political [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4135.719999999999s)]
*  Problem that is driving the conflict right we need to get to a place where there is a palestinian state [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4136.86s)]
*  That is led by palestinians where people uh, it people have a home [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4142.94s)]
*  Um, and so that will require some sort of negotiations with hopefully will lead to a two-state solution in the past [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4147.5s)]
*  In broad strokes, what do you think the process? [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4153.5s)]
*  Got wrong and are there things you think the u.s could do to help fix it going forward or anyone could do [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4156.22s)]
*  There was a lot that that the u.s got wrong [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4163.9800000000005s)]
*  That's really kind of the as you know, the the thrust of my book [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4167.66s)]
*  Which is trying to answer the question of why wasn't the u.s able to be an effective mediator in this case? [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4171.26s)]
*  Whereas in other contexts it could you know the balkans or northern ireland or [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4177.900000000001s)]
*  Um, and it has a lot to do with the fact that [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4182.78s)]
*  You know the special relationship with israel. Um, the fact that the u.s looks u.s [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4185.98s)]
*  Officials lawmakers elected officials [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4193.339999999999s)]
*  Administrations of both parties tend to look at the issue through a very israel centric lens [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4198.12s)]
*  And if you when you do that [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4204.94s)]
*  certain things get filtered out [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4207.179999999999s)]
*  things like [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4209.259999999999s)]
*  The negative consequences of israel's power [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4210.78s)]
*  You know look at look at what's happening now [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4214.38s)]
*  Another thing that gets filtered out is palestinian politics. Um, it's it was I can remember [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4217.82s)]
*  Um dealing with american officials, you know well before october 7th and i'm [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4225.259999999999s)]
*  Always surprised at how little attention they pay to internal palestinian politics [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4231.58s)]
*  Um, and you know like all groups they have politics and it's not just about [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4238.4s)]
*  Um, you know who the prime minister is going to be it is fundamentally about you know [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4244.5599999999995s)]
*  These different factions that have different visions for wanting to lead palestinian national movement [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4249.679999999999s)]
*  and so [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4256.16s)]
*  Between those two blind spots [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4257.44s)]
*  You know the inability to see israel's power and and the asymmetry in power and how that is a driver of the conflict [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4259.599999999999s)]
*  And therefore the key to resolving the conflict [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4267.44s)]
*  and then secondarily the inability to see [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4270.719999999999s)]
*  the internal domestic palestinian political needs [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4274.16s)]
*  That there needs to be a unified [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4278.879999999999s)]
*  palestinian leadership [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4281.74s)]
*  Um, that was not a priority for u.s officials. I mean in fact during the bush administration when that split first happened between hamas and fatah [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4283.28s)]
*  You know palestinians were like, holy crap, this is you know, the our national movement has been fractured [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4292.32s)]
*  The bush administration saw it as a good thing. They said this is an opportunity now [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4299.28s)]
*  we can move forward with the god the good palestinians and sideline and even [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4303.759999999999s)]
*  Um pressuring and even making war on the bad palestinians [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4310.0s)]
*  That just doesn't make sense, you know to to deal with two different sets of palestinians [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4314.719999999999s)]
*  As though and then pretend that one was outside the peace process, right hamas when in fact [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4320.26s)]
*  They could clearly torpedo the process whenever they wanted and and they did so quite often [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4327.46s)]
*  The biden administration today seems primarily focused on securing a normalization agreement [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4334.18s)]
*  Between israel and saudi arabia as part of I guess a broader regional peace effort [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4339.14s)]
*  There's a bunch of reports on this some suggest that the u.s would have to give saudi arabia a security guarantee [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4344.179999999999s)]
*  There's others that suggest you would give them a nuclear energy infrastructure for some reason [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4349.54s)]
*  Um, and the israelis I think you know would be asked to take meaningful steps [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4354.98s)]
*  Towards the creation of a palestinian state. I don't know exactly what that would entail. Hopefully it would be meaningful [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4358.98s)]
*  But um, I think probably the price there went up since october 7th [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4363.54s)]
*  um, I don't know [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4367.78s)]
*  I hear about all this effort being expended on this normalization agreement and I wonder if it's the right path that seems like [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4369.38s)]
*  A bit of a bank shot to me to get to a palestinian state. But what do you what do you make of those efforts? [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4376.02s)]
*  Yeah, I I think you're right. I I you know bank shot's an interesting way to put it [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4381.3s)]
*  I I think it it kind of underscores the extent to which the palestinian issue is not a priority [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4385.54s)]
*  It is a priority now because it has forced itself onto the agenda in very [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4391.3s)]
*  dramatic ways [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4396.900000000001s)]
*  Um, but it wasn't a priority before october 7th. They weren't the administration wasn't shy about that [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4398.42s)]
*  About you know, letting that be known [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4405.3s)]
*  Um, and even now they're thinking about it not in its own [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4408.18s)]
*  on its own terms and for its own sake right that the fact that [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4413.3s)]
*  It's it's sort of even more one step removed [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4418.5s)]
*  um, so now [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4421.7s)]
*  statehood palestinian statehood [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4423.76s)]
*  Isn't the goal [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4426.1s)]
*  But normalization is the goal and palestinian statehood is is one of the boxes that have to be checked in order to get to that [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4428.1s)]
*  Right, you know grand bargain, you know the ultimate deal of israel-saudi normalization [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4435.9400000000005s)]
*  And so it's secondary in in terms of you know, resolving the israel [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4442.18s)]
*  Palestinian piece of that which is really about palestinian sovereignty and self-determination [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4447.9400000000005s)]
*  And so I I just I don't think I don't think this administration appreciates [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4452.98s)]
*  Kind of the core issues of the conflict which isn't hamas [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4459.78s)]
*  The [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4465.7s)]
*  Conflict didn't start on october 7th [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4466.74s)]
*  Terrorism is not the root cause of this conflict. The root cause is the denial of [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4469.459999999999s)]
*  millions of palestinians [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4475.54s)]
*  The most basic rights that other humans are entitled to the right to live free in your own land [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4477.7s)]
*  The right to not be dispossessed the right to not be [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4483.54s)]
*  You know have the soldiers kick down your door in the middle of the night and take people [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4488.1s)]
*  away and held without charge, I mean [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4494.0199999999995s)]
*  Not losing their land. I mean these it's about basic [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4497.38s)]
*  Rights and as long as palestinians don't have [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4501.38s)]
*  Freedom and their basic rights there will be a conflict [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4504.58s)]
*  the administration the administration is not [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4508.26s)]
*  understanding those root causes and is treating [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4511.76s)]
*  Not just the symptoms, but it's treating the symptoms in an indirect way by by by trying to [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4515.3s)]
*  Package it under the umbrella of [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4524.9s)]
*  Package it under the umbrella of [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4528.26s)]
*  Of saudi israel normalization and so it's not even the goal right the goal isn't a palestinian state or two-state solution [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4531.62s)]
*  The goal is saudi israel normalization [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4539.38s)]
*  But on the way well, we're going to have to do something on the palestinians, right? [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4541.86s)]
*  I mean the other thing you you often hear [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4546.26s)]
*  Kind of whispered in washington policy circles and not to sound too cynical here, but people will say well actually, you know [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4548.66s)]
*  Israel's neighbors other countries in the gulf like the saudis like egypt like the uae [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4554.98s)]
*  They publicly criticize israel when they go after hamas, but they quietly like it because they worry about the organization as well [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4559.94s)]
*  Maybe it's a threat to some of the autocrats [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4567.3s)]
*  In the region is that fair is that accurate? Is that just the thing people in washington believe? [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4570.18s)]
*  I think it's you know, it's true to an extent but not true to the extent that folks in washington want it to be true [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4576.26s)]
*  Um, and so it's a little of both. I and I think it's less true every day the longer this goes on [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4584.26s)]
*  um, I can't imagine that the [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4590.9s)]
*  egyptian regime [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4593.38s)]
*  Is thrilled about having a million people who are starved [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4595.06s)]
*  bombarded [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4600.8s)]
*  Desperate on its borders. I I don't see how [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4601.92s)]
*  You know egyptian security and intelligence [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4606.0199999999995s)]
*  Establishment would think this is a good thing. Yeah [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4609.2s)]
*  Um, and so yes, everyone [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4612.099999999999s)]
*  Has a distaste for hamas, but there are limits to to that distaste [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4615.0599999999995s)]
*  and and especially if it involves [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4620.26s)]
*  you know [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4622.98s)]
*  15 000 [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4624.32s)]
*  children being killed in gaza being annihilated and [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4626.0199999999995s)]
*  so [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4629.86s)]
*  I think that particular point is is probably overstated and it also overlooks [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4630.82s)]
*  you know the reason that you know, I [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4637.139999999999s)]
*  Don't think I don't think the regimes in saudi or egypt [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4640.58s)]
*  Or other places in the region [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4646.98s)]
*  Care all that much about palestinian civilians, but I do think that the publics in in these arab countries care a lot [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4649.94s)]
*  And that's something that these regimes pay attention to [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4657.86s)]
*  And and that is that's what at least allows them to say rhetorically at least that they're [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4661.38s)]
*  Um that you know that they support the palestinians and they're critical of israel [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4668.18s)]
*  So it's a it's a it's a bit of a mixed bag. But but I I do think that [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4672.5s)]
*  Arab [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4679.54s)]
*  Ordinary arab citizens across the region have a deep and abiding [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4681.9400000000005s)]
*  Commitment and passion and concern for the palestinian issue [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4689.38s)]
*  Uh, and it's just that most of the regimes are are authoritarian and they don't particularly care about [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4694.42s)]
*  Public opinion, right? You have to imagine the sort of [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4702.34s)]
*  So-called arab street the the concern about the palestinian issue has to have increased since october 7th given just the horrific images that we've all seen [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4705.86s)]
*  Um, oh, yeah, the the the trump era. I mean back to these normalization agreements the trump era [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4713.78s)]
*  abraham accord agreements where israel signs [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4719.38s)]
*  Uh normalization deals with barane morocco the uae sudan those were often [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4722.179999999999s)]
*  Shorthanded in western press as middle east peace agreements [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4728.639999999999s)]
*  But the again the palestinians were just an afterthought in those conversations usually, you know in the case of the uae [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4732.74s)]
*  the us basically [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4739.94s)]
*  Uh made it a huge arms sales deal to get the two sides to normalize right? What do you think the impact? [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4741.46s)]
*  of those [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4748.179999999999s)]
*  normalization deals was [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4749.7s)]
*  on [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4751.78s)]
*  The middle east peace process that we all think about which was efforts to create a palestinian state [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4752.74s)]
*  Yeah [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4758.259999999999s)]
*  I mean, I actually think they were at working at cross purposes and and I know that view is not popular in washington [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4759.139999999999s)]
*  um, but you know, it's not uncommon for folks in dc to [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4767.139999999999s)]
*  Try to shove the square peg in the round hole whenever they can [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4772.34s)]
*  um [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4776.66s)]
*  and and I I do think [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4777.62s)]
*  That pursuing normalization and and I would I would dispute the [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4779.46s)]
*  Even calling them peace treaties as you said [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4784.9s)]
*  Uh, these were countries that were not at war with israel for them to to make peace as such [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4787.78s)]
*  Unlike egypt and jordan, you know their peace treaties with israel. These are two countries that were [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4793.14s)]
*  Historically at war with israel, but the uae morocco. I mean, these are completely different animals in terms of [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4799.28s)]
*  the nature of those agreements [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4807.22s)]
*  um [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4809.62s)]
*  so [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4810.82s)]
*  I I do think that they were [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4811.94s)]
*  designed [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4814.24s)]
*  To kind of circumvent the palestinian issue altogether that tanya who said it in so many words when [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4815.54s)]
*  You know when the abraham accords were were being signed [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4823.94s)]
*  Uh, and and we knew that that was also a priority for the trump administration [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4827.86s)]
*  So if you know if the people who are conceiving it [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4832.1s)]
*  Uh are telling you that this is a way to bypass the palestinian issue [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4836.02s)]
*  um [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4840.900000000001s)]
*  Then then we should you know, we should take them at their word and I do think that it undermined the goal of a palestinian state [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4841.9400000000005s)]
*  because it reduced [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4848.5s)]
*  One of the last remaining incentives that israel had to end its occupation [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4850.26s)]
*  which is [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4856.740000000001s)]
*  You know that being accepted and normalized in the region [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4858.26s)]
*  So if all the arab states normalize with israel, well, then what we have is is pretty much [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4861.86s)]
*  a permanent israeli occupation also known as [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4867.46s)]
*  Apartheid so [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4872.4800000000005s)]
*  If you just take something to its logical end that will tell you [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4874.82s)]
*  Uh the impact that it has and and it's I think it's clear to everyone [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4879.86s)]
*  That the abraham the saudi israel [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4885.06s)]
*  normalization deal in particular [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4888.08s)]
*  Would be would would mean I think the death now of [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4890.32s)]
*  Uh of the two-state solution if it's not already dead [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4895.2s)]
*  Yeah, you have also written a lot about the need for accountability [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4898.88s)]
*  One idea to create, you know a process to get to some accountability for not just this war [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4903.28s)]
*  But other but also past conflicts is the idea of setting up some sort of truth and reconciliation [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4908.88s)]
*  Commission, um, I I think that's a smart idea [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4913.82s)]
*  I also wonder though we're seeing this war [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4917.120000000001s)]
*  empower [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4920.240000000001s)]
*  More extreme voices on both sides in israel. It's people like itamar ben gavir. It's smotrich the finance minister [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4921.4400000000005s)]
*  uh, and of course, you know hamas I think probably has increased its [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4928.72s)]
*  Reputation in the region or at least shown itself to be an uh an actor [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4933.660000000001s)]
*  Uh, whereas the palestinian authority is seen as kind of complacent and corrupt [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4938.0s)]
*  Um, what do you think it would take to get to that kind of process? [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4941.92s)]
*  Is this like pressure from the outside the un the us others or is this like, you know? [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4945.52s)]
*  Do you need like a mandala like figure to emerge from, you know within israel or or gaza? [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4950.160000000001s)]
*  I do I think it's a little of both. I I think there needs to be from the outside [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4956.56s)]
*  There needs to be and even from the inside. Um [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4961.040000000001s)]
*  There needs to be some kind of like a [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4964.4800000000005s)]
*  reconceptualizing of this [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4966.540000000001s)]
*  Of this conflict and how you go about resolving it like the old way of doing it the oslo way [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4969.0199999999995s)]
*  Um is just is not going to work anymore [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4975.34s)]
*  So we you need radically different approaches even if we're still talking about a two-state solution, which in my view is [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4977.98s)]
*  Probably not achievable anymore [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4985.34s)]
*  But I understand that's where the consensus of the international community is and so if that is their priority [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4987.5s)]
*  Then they have to do things differently [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4993.58s)]
*  so [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4996.06s)]
*  You know [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4997.34s)]
*  Just going back to the way things were is not going to work [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=4998.7s)]
*  um [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5002.06s)]
*  And so ideas like a truth and reconciliation commission [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5003.34s)]
*  Need to be pushed from the outside as part of a reconfigured [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5007.34s)]
*  Peace process one that centers rights [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5012.3s)]
*  and security for all sides [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5015.900000000001s)]
*  the way the peace process functioned was because [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5018.860000000001s)]
*  It was a u.s [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5022.9400000000005s)]
*  Mediated process and the u.s israel relationship was so close it naturally [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5024.94s)]
*  favored israeli needs demands narratives and so forth [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5030.78s)]
*  To the exclusion of those same things for palestinians [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5035.259999999999s)]
*  And so you need a different approach that is much more balanced [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5039.82s)]
*  That takes into account the needs of both sides [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5043.98s)]
*  And pushing new ideas like truth and reconciliation like mutual accountability [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5048.379999999999s)]
*  And one of the reasons the oslo process has been such a failure is that it never had any [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5054.0s)]
*  um [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5060.72s)]
*  Accountability mechanisms in place at all there wasn't even kind of a verification process [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5062.0s)]
*  Did each side meet their obligations by the deadline and if not, what are the consequences? [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5066.96s)]
*  They studiously avoided that [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5072.72s)]
*  So you need you need that from the outside pushing in [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5075.04s)]
*  But you also need to have credible leaders leaders who are willing to to to make bold moves and to [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5079.76s)]
*  Re-imagine their own future [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5087.34s)]
*  um, and and we don't have that on either the palestinian or the israeli side I tend to put the onus [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5090.16s)]
*  On the palestinians in the sense that as the weakest party they have the greatest stake [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5097.6s)]
*  And the most to lose [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5103.92s)]
*  In the absence of a resolution and so it is incumbent on them [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5106.64s)]
*  first and foremost [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5112.16s)]
*  to have to kind of put their national movement back together and to establish a [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5113.68s)]
*  cohesive [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5120.22s)]
*  unitary leadership of some kind whether it's [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5121.36s)]
*  Through reconciliation of hamas and fatah or just that does away with them all together and establishes some new leadership [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5125.04s)]
*  um [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5133.36s)]
*  That has to be a priority to have a credible palestinian leader [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5134.64s)]
*  leadership with a vision [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5139.58s)]
*  And that can present itself to the international community that can be taken seriously [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5142.88s)]
*  As the focal point of palestinian agency [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5149.6s)]
*  Now you also need to have a leadership on the israeli side that is willing [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5153.84s)]
*  To make these kinds of concessions right if if the leadership is focused only on [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5159.6s)]
*  Maintaining the status quo forever regardless of the cost [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5165.68s)]
*  uh, then [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5170.320000000001s)]
*  You know that's not going to work. And again, that's where the international community [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5172.240000000001s)]
*  Can come in to incentivize [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5176.96s)]
*  The emergence of a new palestinian leadership to incentivize an israeli leadership to [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5180.240000000001s)]
*  Uh, you know to reassess its cost benefit [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5186.24s)]
*  Analysis of the status quo if the status quo if the u.s [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5190.16s)]
*  Is always deferring or deflecting the cost of the status quo for israel [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5193.839999999999s)]
*  Then israel has no incentive ever to change the status quo [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5199.919999999999s)]
*  So the status quo has to become costly for israel in one form or other politically diplomatically economically [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5203.759999999999s)]
*  Well, that's the logic of the of the bds movement [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5210.639999999999s)]
*  Nothing will change until israel's calculations change [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5214.32s)]
*  And and I think there are [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5220.4s)]
*  you know, there's a role for [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5222.4s)]
*  uh for both [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5224.48s)]
*  Inside israeli palestinian leaders and for outside actors to push inward [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5225.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and like people should just know that the status quo is enormously costly for the palestinians [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5231.679999999999s)]
*  Just in a number of ways but primarily in terms of settlement construction and this sort of de facto [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5237.839999999999s)]
*  slow-motion annexation of the west bank that is getting to the point of making it nearly impossible for there to be a palestinian state or [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5243.5s)]
*  At least one that is contiguous where you can drive from point a to point b [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5251.2s)]
*  Uh in something resembling a straight line [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5255.599999999999s)]
*  So you're you know to your point there's been a one side has a cost the other side does not for the status quo [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5257.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, exactly and and we've now and the costs are increasing so it's no longer just that the the land is being gobbled up [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5263.599999999999s)]
*  That would have been you know for a future palestinian state its whole communities now that are being threatened [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5270.8s)]
*  um there so it's existential there there are [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5277.52s)]
*  communities in area c of the west bank, you know the part that is [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5280.8s)]
*  60 of the west bank that israel still controls when where all the settlements are [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5285.6s)]
*  There are a number of communities that are threatened with complete [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5291.280000000001s)]
*  Removal, but we've already seen about 2 000 or so palestinians [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5294.4800000000005s)]
*  um [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5298.98s)]
*  removed from their uh from their villages, uh in in in the west bank over the last year [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5300.179999999999s)]
*  uh, and you have neighborhoods in jerusalem that are [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5307.94s)]
*  faced with you know demolition or takeover by settlers and [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5312.0199999999995s)]
*  And and those threats are increasing [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5316.66s)]
*  And there is no force acting on them right now and and that is one of the reasons why I think [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5319.78s)]
*  Things exploded on october 7th [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5326.419999999999s)]
*  Because you just have this this this it's it's not just a bad status quo [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5329.62s)]
*  It's a status quo that is bad and it's getting worse every day [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5335.86s)]
*  Yeah, president biden has been placed, you know the an executive order to try to deal with some of the more extremist settlers [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5339.78s)]
*  But I i'm with you. I think they need to ratchet up the pressure seven, right? [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5344.58s)]
*  They need to ratchet up the total of seven individuals, right? [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5348.099999999999s)]
*  With time to go after the the leaderships the itmar ben gabir's of the world. Um final question for you. Look I I [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5351.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's just it I share your skepticism about the prospects of a two-state solution going forward [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5358.1s)]
*  I think you're right that the worst outcome from [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5363.54s)]
*  An event as horrible as october 7th in this war [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5367.860000000001s)]
*  Is the same people in washington meeting with the same palestinian officials and the same israeli negotiators and everything going nowhere [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5371.38s)]
*  For another decade, right? I mean the hopeful piece of this is [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5378.820000000001s)]
*  A boss won't be in charge forever net yahoo will hopefully be gone. Maybe he'll be in jail [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5382.740000000001s)]
*  I don't know that we'll love who comes after but he I think is a particularly [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5388.18s)]
*  venal [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5392.1s)]
*  Awful figure in israeli history. I personally have been enormously frustrated [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5393.3s)]
*  With the way the biden administration has approached this war because of the reasons you discussed like I thought hugging someone like bb net yahoo [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5398.18s)]
*  Who we should not trust in in any event, but especially in this [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5406.34s)]
*  Context where he's clinging to power through the management of the war and trying to evade prosecution [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5410.419999999999s)]
*  So i'm with you on like the frustration to this point [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5417.219999999999s)]
*  I guess if you were you know [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5420.419999999999s)]
*  The national security advisor and you could kind of snap your fingers and make some calls over the next six months [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5421.78s)]
*  What do you think you'd like to see president biden do going forward to to get us to a better place? [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5427.299999999999s)]
*  You know not just in the short term but long term you mean beyond an immediate ceasefire. Yeah [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5432.339999999999s)]
*  I mean, I think demanding a immediate ceasefire is like table stakes, right? [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5436.74s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I mean, that's the that's the first step [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5441.219999999999s)]
*  um, I mean [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5444.5s)]
*  I would I would like to see a recognition, uh of the damage that was done and some accountability [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5448.9s)]
*  Uh, you know the the notion that the administration could certify that israel was in perfect compliance with international [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5456.26s)]
*  humanitarian law [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5463.12s)]
*  Despite what we're seeing with our own eyes and despite what happened just a few days ago with the world central kitchen and with [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5465.0599999999995s)]
*  Ashifa hospital and the horror stories coming out of gaza on a regular basis [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5472.0199999999995s)]
*  um [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5477.3s)]
*  You know there would need to be some kind of accountability [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5478.42s)]
*  Uh, I would like to see a halt on on weapons transfers [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5481.94s)]
*  Until you know certain actions were taken whether it's on the humanitarian front [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5487.22s)]
*  um [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5492.74s)]
*  You know allowing humanitarian aid to to reach gaza, but also gaza's reconstruction [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5493.94s)]
*  uh and [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5499.219999999999s)]
*  You know a much more concerted effort to [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5502.0199999999995s)]
*  encourage [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5505.36s)]
*  a palestinian leadership that is unitary and cohesive [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5506.58s)]
*  um a kind of real politic acknowledgement [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5510.66s)]
*  That that hamas will be a force in palestinian politics [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5514.179999999999s)]
*  Uh and and therefore there need to be smart ways of trying to neutralize its negative influences [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5518.280000000001s)]
*  rather than just [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5524.84s)]
*  You know the hammer [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5526.76s)]
*  um, because [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5528.52s)]
*  That's how we get [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5530.200000000001s)]
*  You know to where we are so i'd like to see a lot more nuance in the approach to internal palestinian politics [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5531.72s)]
*  um a lot more accountability with regard to israeli actions [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5538.68s)]
*  And from there I think the u.s can start to rebuild its credibility that it has [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5543.160000000001s)]
*  Very [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5549.64s)]
*  You know, uh, it's that it's completely dismantled [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5551.0s)]
*  Over the last six months. I I don't think there's any palestinian [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5555.64s)]
*  leadership [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5560.26s)]
*  At any point in the future that will look at the united states [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5562.52s)]
*  Uh in the same way as as someone who can play an effective or positive role [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5566.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah build that credibility to even be seen as a an honest broker in this process to the extent we ever were [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5571.96s)]
*  I mean for being honest, right? [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5577.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean we we were we weren't necessarily honest brokers, but we were [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5580.04s)]
*  At least had the potential to be an effective broker [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5585.32s)]
*  um, but [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5589.0s)]
*  You know, I would go back to maybe the the clinton administration maybe was the last [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5591.719999999999s)]
*  Moment in which it was possible [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5597.08s)]
*  Um [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5599.8s)]
*  For for the u.s to play that role by the time even obama came in I think things on the ground had just [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5602.04s)]
*  deteriorated so much and [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5608.42s)]
*  That it just wasn't achievable. So [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5611.24s)]
*  You know theoretically the u.s could play a much more constructive role without abandoning [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5614.04s)]
*  uh its commitment to to israel's security, it's just [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5620.92s)]
*  They haven't yeah haven't wanted to they just haven't yeah, it's just up to normalize the relationship a carrot and a stick approach [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=173xS8tP6A4&t=5625.08s)]
