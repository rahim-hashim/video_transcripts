Video Description: Tommy and Ben discuss Biden’s call with Israeli PM Bibi Netanyahu and threat to cut off US support for the war in Gaza, Israel’s announcement that it would open more aid corridors into Gaza, and the head spinning change in political support for the war in Washington. They also explain why Ecuadorian police raided Mexico’s embassy and sparked a global diplomatic crisis, Trump’s “secret plan” to end the war in Ukraine, the election of a pro-Russian president in Slovakia, the Japanese Prime Minister’s State Visit with Biden, how a trillion-dollar Saudi infrastructure project has already become a disaster, and the world’s saddest political tweet via the Tory Party in the UK. Then Ben speaks to David Miliband, the President of the International Rescue Committee, about the moral and legal imperative to try to save lives in Gaza.

*  President Biden [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=128.52s)]

*  We'll talk about that. We'll also talk about the sea change in political opinion in the US on this war [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=135.72s)]
*  And we will talk about this sort of anxious wait and see to see if Iran retaliates militarily to [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=141.68s)]

*  We're also gonna cover a diplomatic crisis in Ecuador that is spilling into all of our story. That is a crazy [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=153.24s)]
*  Yeah, I can't wait to find I read a lot about that. Yeah, me too Trump's secret plan for Ukraine [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=158.96s)]
*  There was an election in Slovakia Japan as a state visit in Washington this week on Wednesday [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=164.0s)]
*  There's also a fun update on our favorite boondoggle in Saudi Arabia and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=169.2s)]
*  Some more sad embarrassing Tory party news Ben. It's the best kind that's kind of [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  And then you did our interview this week. What are folks can hear so I talked to David Miliband former labor [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=179.96s)]
*  Foreign secretary for the UK, but talked to him as the head of the International Rescue Committee [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=185.84s)]
*  The IRC the IRC is one of the eight organizations on the ground in Gaza [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=190.0s)]
*  They don't the Lord's work. Yeah, and they'd previously actually had [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=194.96s)]
*  One of their guest houses that their personnel were sitting at, you know hit by and is really [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=198.72s)]
*  So so they you know, we talked about the aftermath of the World Central Kitchen strike, obviously [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=203.96s)]
*  the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=210.24s)]
*  Need to get more aid into Gaza and Miliband was [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=211.56s)]
*  Pretty clear that they've not seen any change since this call that Biden had we can talk more about that [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  We talked about the difficult trade-off that they have to make about you know wanting to perform their mission [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=220.52s)]
*  But also wanting to protect their people because they have to make those kinds of hard calls [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=225.78s)]
*  What kind of needs to happen in Gaza? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=230.3s)]
*  Immediately, but also kind of what is on the horizon in dealing with this humanitarian crisis [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=232.98s)]
*  You know in terms of if there is a ceasefire what still needs to happen and then also they've been very active in Sudan [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=238.02s)]
*  So we talked about the one year anniversary of the Civil War in Sudan [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=243.54s)]
*  Miliband was recently in South Sudan and talked a little bit about the UK and what changes we might want to see if [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=247.78s)]
*  There is a labor government. So it's a good, you know full and frank conversation [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=255.3s)]
*  I'm gonna say that's a great conversation [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=259.1s)]
*  I was at one but people should actually listen because he gives kind of some real ground truth in terms of like what it is [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=260.02s)]
*  Like to be a humanitarian organization in Gaza. What is the risk of famine? What does that look like? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=264.92s)]
*  So it people should really stick around for the interview. Yeah into your point [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=270.66s)]
*  I mean the the risk of them it doesn't go away the day the shelling stops. That's what he said actually was interesting, you know [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=274.12s)]
*  Famine areas it emerges slowly, but then once it hits [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=280.34000000000003s)]
*  It's really hard to address both the immediate life-saving needs, but then also the malnutrition needs so we talk about that [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=285.17999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it's gonna be a long-term effort. Okay. Well, let's turn to Gaza because you know last week [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=291.94s)]
*  We talked about the Israeli drone strike that killed those aid workers with a World Central Kitchen [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=297.21999999999997s)]
*  Which is that great relief organization founded by Jose Andres? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=301.73999999999995s)]
*  So in the wake of that airstrike President Biden called Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=304.7s)]
*  He reportedly read in the riot acts with a list of demands that included [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=309.90000000000003s)]
*  Opening up more crossings into Gaza to get into Gaza [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=313.54s)]
*  And he called on him to drastically increase the amount of aid getting into the current access points into Gaza [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=316.82s)]
*  And so it sounds you know, according to the reports about the call [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=323.74s)]
*  Biden also wanted those changes to be announced immediately and he told Bibi that if they didn't happen there would be consequences that could include [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=327.26s)]
*  Losing US support for the war or maybe the US conditioning aid to Israel's not entirely clear what was said [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=335.46s)]
*  So we do know that Netanyahu quickly announced there would be new crossings for aid to allow aid into Gaza [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=340.96s)]
*  They seem to have allowed more aid at the existing crossings [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=347.22s)]
*  So on Tuesday April 9th Israel says 468 a trucks were inspected and transferred into Gaza on Monday [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=350.5s)]
*  419 on Sunday 322 that is way up from the February average of 98 trucks a day [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=357.62s)]
*  In other Gaza news the CIA director Bill Burns was in Cairo for the latest rounds of talks about a ceasefire and [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=364.14s)]
*  hostage release deal there have been reports that [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=369.41999999999996s)]
*  The negotiators on the Israeli side were mad at Netanyahu for not giving them enough flexibility to make a deal [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=372.5s)]
*  It sounds like that has changed a bit at least [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=378.26s)]
*  According to Axios Israel's latest proposal includes releasing 900 Palestinian prisoners in the deal. That's up from 700 [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=380.94s)]
*  Netanyahu though is still promising to launch a ground invasion into Rafa the city in southern Gaza [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=388.84s)]
*  We're over a million Palestinians are sheltering. He says he has picked the date [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=393.76s)]
*  Save the date. I guess it's a weird thing to do. The defense minister by the way says there is no date [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=398.4s)]
*  It's Mark Ben Gavir the right-wing national security minister says he will withdraw support from the governing coalition if a Rafa invasion doesn't happen [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=403.03999999999996s)]
*  So that's the politics. It's probably why there's a thing about the date. Yeah, that's why there's a fake date on the calendar [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=410.9s)]
*  The US still says this is a terrible idea. We haven't seen a plan to protect civilians. So hope it doesn't happen [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=415.64000000000004s)]
*  So that's like the big ticket policy disputes Ben [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=422.32s)]
*  I do want to get into the broader changes in US political opinion on the war in a second [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=424.72s)]
*  But I'm wondering how much do you think these well, I don't know if it's quick inaction [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=429.52000000000004s)]
*  I don't know if it was quick action or quick announcements from Netanyahu at this point stems from the fact that Biden [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=434.42s)]
*  Finally laid down the law on this call or how much of it is like six months of public opinion turning against them [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=440.72s)]
*  And just knowing that this like airstrike on aid workers is indefensible. I [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=447.32000000000005s)]
*  Think and first of all, there's an interesting, you know [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=453.28000000000003s)]
*  The you and I were talking before about Miliband's [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=456.56s)]
*  You know what he's hearing from people on the ground not seeing changes versus some of these trucks getting in but part of that [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=460.40000000000003s)]
*  Is that they're also supposed to be these additional crossings [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=465.72s)]
*  Where there may not be changes yet, I do want to say though and I know you hit this on PSA [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=468.8s)]
*  you know [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=475.52000000000004s)]
*  World those were just like you I listened to Pots of America on my drive-in today [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=476.76s)]
*  but it bears [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=481.64s)]
*  emphasis that [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=483.68s)]
*  The strategy as articulated was always like you got a hug BB. You got to only disagree in private [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=486.76s)]
*  We can condition aid [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=493.58000000000004s)]
*  We should recall Tommy that you and I way back in the 2020 campaign [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=495.46000000000004s)]
*  We're trying to get every candidate on the record about would you condition assistance, right? Shut up Bernie [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=498.78000000000003s)]
*  Shut up Bernie was a Pete Pete. Well, you know, remember it was more narrow [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=503.22s)]
*  It was like would you condition aid if it's used to annex the West Bank? Yeah, it was hard to get people to agree to that [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=507.14000000000004s)]
*  so [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=511.18s)]
*  What we've learned is that strategy is bullshit. It is doesn't work. It's so [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=512.7s)]
*  Evidently wrong to say we'll never say that there'll be any conditions and expect you to change [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=518.72s)]
*  The first time that Joe Biden reportedly directly said if you don't do X we might consider why [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=524.2s)]
*  So he didn't even they weren't even specific about will cut off military assistance or offensive military assistance [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=531.28s)]
*  Just him saying that at least led them to announce this change in policy and to get some trucks in [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=537.24s)]
*  So we have learned we now have a data set what happens when you say we're not gonna condition anything [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=545.04s)]
*  But we'll counsel you in private that didn't work for six months [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=551.08s)]
*  Then there's one phone call in which he said that and guess what they changed [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=554.6s)]
*  Yeah [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=558.88s)]
*  And so the lesson that should be taken not just for the next few weeks and not just until there's a ceasefire [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=559.12s)]
*  But forever going for ever forever is that if you have leverage you need to use it and this idea that we [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=564.08s)]
*  Say that we'll use leverage with every other country [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=571.08s)]
*  But not Israel is an insane way of doing policy and not since the George HW Bush administration [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=573.9599999999999s)]
*  Were they very clearly used leverage as did Ronald Reagan by the way, there were threats there was public shaming [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=579.68s)]
*  There was lots of criticism of the Israeli government policies at the time [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=584.76s)]
*  Yeah, you know and what I'd say is, you know, we in the Obama administration [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=587.9399999999999s)]
*  I think could have done more particularly the Palestinian issue to exert that leverage [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=592.0799999999999s)]
*  I frankly would have liked it at times but are on the Iran deal where Netanyahu came and [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=595.36s)]
*  You know gave a speech to Congress opposing it [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=601.52s)]
*  Well, the leverage was we just did you know, like some that you can also take actions that are contrary to what Netanyahu wants [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=604.02s)]
*  So that to me and win those fights. Yeah that to me is like the the headline of this last week [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=609.32s)]
*  And again, we still you know [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=615.4000000000001s)]
*  Haven't even seen a specification of what the consequences would be it seems like it's offensive military aid [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=616.96s)]
*  But but this is a sea change in the Biden administration's approach [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=622.52s)]
*  If they follow through on it and if Israel doesn't follow through on their commitments [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=626.92s)]
*  And then we do really need to see some conditionality not just announced but actually imposed [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=631.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean then the other like quick point I wanted to make on this is it it seems unclear whether these new aid crossings [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=636.84s)]
*  Have been opened yet or not, but it does seem clear that at least by [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=643.94s)]
*  According to these realese about 4x the number of trucks got in the last couple days this week [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=648.36s)]
*  Than got in on average in February. I wanted to read for you a tweet from a guy named Ron Dermer [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=653.62s)]
*  He's a top Netanyahu a really horrible guy on March 26 [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=659.26s)]
*  He tweeted the following those who suggest that Israel has a policy of denying food or basic assistance to the people of Gaza are simply [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=663.8199999999999s)]
*  Spreading falsehoods. It's a blood libel against Israel [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=670.54s)]
*  Well, it turns out that one phone call from Joe Biden can quadruple the amount of assistance allowed into Gaza through the existing crossing [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=673.9s)]
*  So I don't know that that was a blood libel. It seems like it was a policy choice [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=681.9s)]
*  Yeah [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=685.16s)]
*  Well, it's a policy choice to that they announced in the first days of the war like the defense minister was saying no food [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=685.9s)]
*  No water, right? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=691.74s)]
*  I mean, this is something that they went out and announced and and look this is not to excuse anything about Hamas [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=692.5799999999999s)]
*  The reality is Hamas does not control those crossings Israel does that's just basic fact [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=698.9s)]
*  You know, I'm sorry like it's the case that we can see with our eyes [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=705.18s)]
*  That Israel controls everything that gets in and out of Gaza [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=709.74s)]
*  And you sure there may be difficulty in getting aid to some areas if Hamas is operating there [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=712.94s)]
*  But if you talk to Miliband the other point he makes it's really important. Is it this isn't like charity? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=717.86s)]
*  This is international law, right? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=723.14s)]
*  Israel is internationally legally obligated to let this assistance get in that's common practice in war zones [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=725.38s)]
*  And and so also to say it's too hard because it's a war zone [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=731.6600000000001s)]
*  That's not how this works in all war zones the the the warring parties have an obligation to allow for assistance to get to [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=734.94s)]
*  Civilian populations here. And so that's what needs to happen now. This isn't like a siege in the Middle Ages [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=743.0200000000001s)]
*  This is a modern warfare before we move on to the politics in the US [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=747.82s)]
*  I did want to play a clip from Jose Andres from ABC News over the weekend talking about this [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=751.24s)]
*  Devastating attack on his staff and what it meant to him in the organization. Your CEO said this was unforgivable [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=756.9000000000001s)]
*  Despite [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=764.94s)]
*  What happens with the investigation despite? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=766.7s)]
*  However, more is done [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=769.94s)]
*  Is this unforgivable? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=772.62s)]
*  It is unforgivable. I [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=775.3800000000001s)]
*  will have to [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=778.2600000000001s)]
*  Live with these the rest of my life. We all will have to live with these the rest of our lives. I've seen firsthand [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=779.82s)]
*  What has been happening in Ukraine? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=786.0600000000001s)]
*  Entire towns and cities being wiped out by Russia and by Putin [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=788.9000000000001s)]
*  What Prime Minister Netanyahu is doing is exactly the same, you know [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=793.2s)]
*  So I think we both have been we both have been lucky enough to meet Jose [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=796.6s)]
*  You know not just in the context of his restaurants in DC [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=800.0s)]
*  But also just through the humanitarian work you did and you can hear that the guy's just you know devastated by this [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=802.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I met him a number of times including he won with us to Cuba [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=807.6800000000001s)]
*  Actually had a very memorable dinner in Cuba with Jose Andres [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=812.32s)]
*  That was a special event [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=816.52s)]
*  But I think he's emerged as an important moral voice here [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=818.28s)]
*  And and I think he would agree with the fact that it is unforgivable that these world central kitchen aid workers are killed [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=822.92s)]
*  It is also unforgivable that [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=830.36s)]
*  Over 15,000 Palestinian children have likely been killed. It's unforgivable that food has been used as a weapon of war [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=833.24s)]
*  It's unforgivable not just that these Westerners were killed but that we've been seeing this [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=840.0799999999999s)]
*  I mean again as Miliband said to me like [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=846.24s)]
*  There's not another time in recent history where a population went from no risk of famine to the [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=849.24s)]
*  Doorstep universe this fast, you know, like this is not normal. It's not [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=855.88s)]
*  It's just not something that we can [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=860.68s)]
*  Can sit and watch and think that that this is just how things work, you know [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=863.76s)]
*  this is not how things work and I think you know, he's a good sign of I [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=868.16s)]
*  mean to take a positive from this Tommy like [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=872.88s)]
*  A lot of people out there kind of feel like world events are going in this bad direction [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=875.88s)]
*  Politics is going in this bad direction. There's nothing I can do. This guy was a chef [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=880.56s)]
*  We were in DC at a few good restaurants, you know [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=886.0s)]
*  OML hello, whatever and and he looked at the world and was like, you know, I'm gonna do something [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=889.64s)]
*  I'm gonna try to help feed some people and over a course of years that grew into this [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=894.24s)]
*  Massive sprawling humanitarian institution. It is a sign that like people can step up and do something, you know [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=899.36s)]
*  And so yeah, that's the example. I hope people take from Jose Andreas [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=904.96s)]
*  Yeah, and look Jose has changed the politics on this war in Washington personally more than any of us [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=907.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but it's also it's hard to overstate how much the politics were at large have changed in the last couple days or weeks [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=913.48s)]
*  According to Haaretz a quarter of house Democrats now back conditioning aid to Israel [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=919.6800000000001s)]
*  Congressman Gregory Meeks the ranking member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=924.6s)]
*  Said on CNN that he wants to see Israeli assurances regarding [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=928.4000000000001s)]
*  Civilian casualties and how weapons are gonna be used before he's willing to greenlight future weapons sales [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=932.36s)]
*  Including items like f-15 fighter jets that wouldn't be delivered for years [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=937.6800000000001s)]
*  Got Nancy Pelosi signing on to a letter with 40 House Democrats [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=942.48s)]
*  Asking Biden to withhold additional arms transfers until there's an investigation [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=946.64s)]
*  Into the world central kitchen airstrike and Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she believes Israel's war will be considered a genocide [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=950.96s)]
*  So that's incredibly, you know, she's leaning very far forward on this [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=959.88s)]
*  But in case you hear that listen think like oh, that's just a bunch of liberal Democrats [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=963.84s)]
*  Please listen to this this medley of comments by the former Council of Foreign Relations [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=967.4s)]
*  Chairman or president Richard Haas Joe Scarborough and Democrat Chris Coons these attacks are continuing and yet [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=973.38s)]
*  So are us arms transfers to Israel without conditions. They've been going on for six months [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=980.48s)]
*  Why does Israel need 2,000 pound bombs to be used in high-density populated areas then 10 days ago? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=985.64s)]
*  What does Israel do it expropriates 2,000 acres of land in the West Bank for settlement construction? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=992.16s)]
*  Where is the White House reaction to that? Let me ask you this [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=998.08s)]
*  Why did Benjamin that in Yahoo and Donald Trump know in 2018? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1001.64s)]
*  the sources of Hamas is illicit funding and [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1005.96s)]
*  They still did nothing [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1010.24s)]
*  They wanted that money to get the boss I'd like to know why because we don't know in America [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1012.64s)]
*  Is or have there been any investigations in Israel at this point? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1017.6s)]
*  If Benjamin Netanyahu prime minister were to order the IDF into Rafa at scale [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1021.28s)]
*  They were to drop thousand pound bombs and send in a battalion [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1026.72s)]
*  To go after Hamas and make no provision for civilians or for humanitarian aid that that I would vote to condition aid to Israel [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1030.76s)]
*  I've never said that before I've never been here before [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1038.72s)]
*  So Richard Haas worked in the Bush administration both of them actually Joe Scarborough was a Republican congressman [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1041.2s)]
*  He was in that clip was ripping into the Israeli economy minister Chris Coons is a moderate Democrat [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1046.96s)]
*  He's very very close to President Biden. So then like as you were saying a minute ago [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1053.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm very glad that the DC foreign policy consensus is moving to a better place [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1056.92s)]
*  It is very gross that it took the killing a bunch of white Western aid workers to get us there [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1062.76s)]
*  Well, I know let's talk about that [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1068.0s)]
*  What do you think that tells us about US foreign policy or maybe lessons learned to kind of speed up this evolution in the future? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1070.12s)]
*  You know and for people who are tearing their hair out saying like how did reports of thousands of kids dying not move the kind of? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1077.2s)]
*  DC blob faster [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1084.44s)]
*  Yeah, I have a lot of thoughts and feelings about this Tommy [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1086.64s)]
*  Because it is important and I'm glad it's happening. But before I get to that piece of it [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1091.64s)]
*  This was all obvious months ago, you know, so I'm glad you know Richard Haas [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1097.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm sure who eats at Jose Andres restaurants. I'm really glad he's out there saying what he's saying, but like he you know [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1101.16s)]
*  Why was the 2000-pound bomb? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1107.24s)]
*  That was dropped on a refugee camp early in the war that was in November. It was in November [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1109.76s)]
*  We talked about that we talked about the time and we were talking about conditioning aid. And so that that's just to say I [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1114.8400000000001s)]
*  Wish this happened earlier and I wish it didn't take Jose Andres as people getting killed for it to happen [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1122.0400000000002s)]
*  and I think that that's important to note because a lot of people now are looking at where this is going and [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1128.24s)]
*  They're trying to get on the right side of history [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1133.8000000000002s)]
*  They're trying to get on the right side of public opinion at this time [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1135.8000000000002s)]
*  And again, that's good and actually part of what that shows is that the pressure [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1139.0400000000002s)]
*  That young people in particular and that Arab and Muslim communities have put from the bottom up is now being [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1143.16s)]
*  Manifested from the top down because these are kind of the the pinnacle of the kind of DC world [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1149.6799999999998s)]
*  Expressing these views and that is very good and to speak to the people in Congress [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1155.36s)]
*  Chris Coons not exactly, you know someone you know, he's been very close to Israel over the years Greg Meeks [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1159.1599999999999s)]
*  These are not the squad, right? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1165.76s)]
*  These are this is a sea change in kind of the middle of Congress now being for conditioning assistance [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1167.6399999999999s)]
*  And and that that's a massive shift that we're watching take place [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1173.56s)]
*  I think again the question and it's the same thing with the [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1177.48s)]
*  Biden call the question is [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1181.68s)]
*  does that continue as [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1184.44s)]
*  the memory of this [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1187.0s)]
*  strike on the World Central kitchen fade if [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1188.8s)]
*  Israel just make some announcements but continues to do what they're doing right does that pressure stay up? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1191.32s)]
*  There's the muscle memory of like political fear of a pack [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1195.64s)]
*  Yeah [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1198.8s)]
*  does it return stick around and also like because another thing that's important to note is that a [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1199.28s)]
*  Lot of this has become kind of personalized to BB which is understandable like we personalized a lot of criticism to be on this show [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1205.24s)]
*  But you know if there's a Benny Gantz in there [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1213.04s)]
*  We should have the same concerns about settlements in the West Bank in violence against Palestinians and obviously about the situation in Gaza [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1215.92s)]
*  So I do think that this is I've never seen anything like this in my life as it relates to the US relationship with Israel [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1224.0s)]
*  There seems to be [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1232.56s)]
*  a tipping point that was reached and [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1234.76s)]
*  That is you know put even Joe Biden in this position where he's shifting [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1237.24s)]
*  You know when Joe Biden is background she wants the war to end like something is changing [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1240.68s)]
*  That is an interesting piece of this folks haven't seen there's some reports that the first lady was pushing Biden the hardest behind the scenes to change positions on the war [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1245.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, which? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1252.48s)]
*  You know says a lot again [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1255.2s)]
*  about where this is and and it does again it really matters because I [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1257.28s)]
*  Just don't think that that the Israeli government could sustain what they're doing in Gaza [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1262.6000000000001s)]
*  If the US were to withdraw support and withdraw offensive weapons [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1267.6000000000001s)]
*  Not just practically that they want the deliveries of those weapons [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1271.32s)]
*  But the degree of isolation that they would find themselves in Nenya's whole case as we've talked about it's always been like I'm the guy that [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1274.56s)]
*  Can basically speak smoothly to the Americans and just do what the right wing in this country wants to do and that is now [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1280.16s)]
*  No longer the case yeah [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1287.0800000000002s)]
*  Trump was on Hugh Hewitt show friend of the pod Hugh Hewitt. He was asked about Gaza again Trump [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1289.24s)]
*  We talked a week or two back about how Trump did this interview with Sheldon Adelson's newspaper in [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1295.1599999999999s)]
*  Israel he these like I think they're actual settlers there were super far right wingers conducting the interview Trump's answers freaked them out [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1300.8799999999999s)]
*  They interpreted it as him cutting off support for Israel, so he would ask him again. Here's a clip of Trump's response [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1308.52s)]
*  Well, that's all the advice you can give I mean that's the advice you got to get it over with and yeah [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1314.0s)]
*  You have to get back to normalcy, and I'm not sure that I'm loving the way [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1319.08s)]
*  They're doing it because you got to have victory you have to have a victory and it's taking a long time and [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1324.1999999999998s)]
*  The other thing is I hate they put out tapes all the time every night [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1331.76s)]
*  They're releasing tapes of a building falling down. They shouldn't be releasing tapes like that [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1335.62s)]
*  They're doing that's why they're losing the PR war they Israel is absolutely losing the PR war [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1340.56s)]
*  That's how I read your interview I read your interview is saying they're losing the PR war [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1345.64s)]
*  They've got to stop releasing bad video and win the war by going into Rafa [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1349.8600000000001s)]
*  they're releasing the most heinous both horrible tapes of buildings falling down and [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1354.8600000000001s)]
*  People are imagining. There's a lot of people in those buildings or people in those buildings and they don't like it [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1361.3200000000002s)]
*  And I don't know why they release you know wartime shots like that. I guess it makes them look tough [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1367.98s)]
*  But to me it doesn't make them look tough. They're losing the PR war [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1373.88s)]
*  They're losing it big [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1377.52s)]
*  But they've got to finish what they started and they got to finish it fast and we have to get on with life [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1378.92s)]
*  So I think I mean every Trump interviews a Rorsach tests. You know he says [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1384.8000000000002s)]
*  Nothing, he's like finish it the war but end it. He's not complaining about the death toll [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1389.92s)]
*  He's complaining about the PR around the death toll [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1395.7s)]
*  Never mind that Israel is not actually allowing reporters into the Gaza Strip to cover what's happening [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1398.88s)]
*  So I don't know maybe he's mad about like social media. That's being released by the IDF soldiers on the ground [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1403.72s)]
*  I don't know what he's talking about, but I I find it kind of interesting Tommy because [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1410.24s)]
*  You heard Hugh Hewitt who once he's like bloodthirsty. You know like yes, so Hugh Hewitt comes in [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1415.52s)]
*  He's like I hear you saying that they should go to Rafa and Trump's like no they shouldn't release tapes like he Trump didn't [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1420.84s)]
*  You know what I hear there and I think Democrats should hear this as a warning, right? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1427.52s)]
*  Donald Trump doesn't know much about it this you know, he probably doesn't know what Rafa is, right? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1433.28s)]
*  But he knows this is hurting Joe Biden [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1438.4599999999998s)]
*  He knows it's dividing Democrats and he's trying to do the same thing that he did on abortion, right? [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1440.3999999999999s)]
*  In the sense that he's not he's gonna he'd be worse than Joe Biden on this issue [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1446.32s)]
*  Like he wouldn't be trying to get any aid in he wouldn't give a shit [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1451.08s)]
*  But he knows politically that this is bad for Joe Biden so he doesn't want to be out there [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1454.4s)]
*  I mean, he's actually been pretty restrained. He's not saying go in there and kill him all and stuff [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1460.28s)]
*  he's trying to step back and stay out of it and [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1465.92s)]
*  And let Biden just be in this political box that he's in [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1468.96s)]
*  I think that's a big warning right that they smell a problem for Biden and they don't want to let Biden out of that box [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1472.6s)]
*  By saying the difference, you know, he doesn't want to articulate a difference from Biden on this thing [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1480.64s)]
*  You know, and he doesn't want to get BB's back [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1487.0s)]
*  I think in part because of the politics you described then he knows that it's bad for Biden [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1488.8000000000002s)]
*  But also he's still pissed in it in Yahoo for not [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1492.6000000000001s)]
*  Remember right after October 7th, he was like, oh, you know [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1496.68s)]
*  BB's terrible. He didn't go along with the Cosm Soleimani assassination. He said husband is smart. He started attacking the Israelis [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1500.3200000000002s)]
*  Well, yeah, so again, I want to be clear [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1507.1200000000001s)]
*  I think Trump would be worse, but I'm just saying this to me is like a political warning more than anything else said like [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1509.16s)]
*  You know when Donald Trump is not taking the bait that Hugh Hewitt's offering to try to say yeah [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1516.24s)]
*  I would be tougher. I'd go in a Rafa, you know [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1522.1200000000001s)]
*  He's he's trying to kind of you know, keep a step back on this thing. Yeah a couple more quick things [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1525.0400000000002s)]
*  I'm just Gaza. By the way, what tapes is he? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1530.72s)]
*  Anyway, I'm not sure I think there are like videos from the IDF of them like hitting targets and shooting [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1533.2s)]
*  That's probably being released to domestic Israeli media to show how tough they're being and their response [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1539.16s)]
*  Yeah, but um, it's weird that that's what surface [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1544.72s)]
*  So we mentioned this at the top we are still waiting to see if Iran [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1550.76s)]
*  Retaliates to the Israeli airstrike over the week last week. They killed a bunch of top Iranian generals in Syria [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1554.68s)]
*  There were a bunch of scary stories over the weekend about an imminent attack [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1560.0800000000002s)]
*  The Israeli government was scrambling GPS service across the country to try to protect themselves [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1563.8400000000001s)]
*  So the AP reported that Iran's foreign minister said that the US's failure to condemn the attack on the IRGC generals [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1568.76s)]
*  Quote indicates that Washington had given the green light to Israel to commit this crime and quote [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1577.0s)]
*  The US denies having advanced knowledge of the strike other news outlets have reported that Iran has said to the US that if we can [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1582.64s)]
*  Broker a ceasefire in Gaza, they won't respond militarily. So I guess we'll just all wait and see here [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1588.96s)]
*  Huffpo had a fascinating interview with two top Hamas leaders [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1593.32s)]
*  It's worth reading in full but one important takeaway was that one of the Hamas guys Abu marzouk [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1596.8400000000001s)]
*  Said Hamas would reject and fight any force in Gaza, including an Arab led force which complicates that path [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1602.1200000000001s)]
*  There were you know, international Arab led peacekeeping force [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1609.0s)]
*  And then finally been this magazine plus 970 magazine. They published [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1613.1200000000001s)]
*  This extensive investigation into the IDF's intelligence collection and targeting in Gaza. It is quite disturbing [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1618.3200000000002s)]
*  It's this long piece but some takeaways are one that the IDF was using artificial intelligence to select targets and [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1624.92s)]
*  selecting enormous numbers of them [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1631.24s)]
*  To that they were intentionally bombing the homes of low-level fighters and killing their families because they knew it was easier to find them [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1633.64s)]
*  In the home three and the fighters like if you're a fighter, you're probably not at home [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1640.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's like literally they watch you walk in the door and then they just blow up these buildings according to report [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1645.16s)]
*  Three that the acceptable number of civilian casualties for a strike involving a low-level Hamas operative was as high as 20 [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1650.3200000000002s)]
*  And in one instance the army authorized killing 300 civilians in a strike targeting a senior commander [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1658.8400000000001s)]
*  So again, it speaks to the total disregard for civilian casualties. So look, I don't I haven't seen anyone else confirm [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1665.0800000000002s)]
*  The anecdotes in this report but pretty disturbing dystopian stuff here [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1671.96s)]
*  That would help explain that staggering death toll but look anything else jump out of you before we move on from the Gaza section [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1676.2s)]
*  Well on the well the AI stuff is chilling and at some point we should have a longer conversation about the need to develop some norms [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1682.24s)]
*  Really? The use of AI and war the this degree of tolerance [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1689.52s)]
*  War does something to obviously above all the civilians were impacted by it [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1694.68s)]
*  But it also does something to the countries that are carrying it out [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1699.44s)]
*  You know, I don't think it's been healthy for the United States to be in the war on terror for near two decades [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1702.32s)]
*  and yet, you know [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1708.32s)]
*  we [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1710.9199999999998s)]
*  One of the reasons we didn't take a strike at the bin Laden compound but sent in a seal team at risk [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1712.0s)]
*  Was to avoid the civilian casualties of bin Laden's family [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1718.56s)]
*  Their tolerance is 20 for a low-level person and 300. That's that's just [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1723.6399999999999s)]
*  That's not again, it's not normal that's not rules of engagement [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1730.1599999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah, there are civilian casualties in war. The US has caused all men or civilian casualties in war [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1732.9199999999998s)]
*  I'm not like suggesting that Israel is the only country that but this this kind of degree of tolerance [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1737.9599999999998s)]
*  Is it's not good for Israel to be in a place where they think that's okay, you know [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1746.0s)]
*  on the regional conflict, I think [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1751.8s)]
*  Look the Iranians [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1755.1599999999999s)]
*  This does feel like we'll have to wait and see what they do [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1757.3200000000002s)]
*  There were reports of them getting more involved in the West Bank and trying to get more, you know military assistance in there [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1761.48s)]
*  They clearly intend to do something the one point I'd make while we wait for this is this can get worse [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1768.96s)]
*  Like, you know, it seems like you know, the the war is somehow peaking and on the way to a ceasefire [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1774.76s)]
*  Rafa would be a massive escalation Gaza and if Iran hits Israel proper [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1780.44s)]
*  it's likely that Israel would feel the need to hit Iran proper and return and then all the sudden you could have [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1785.48s)]
*  Literally a war between Iran and Israel or Hezbollah could do it and it's a war between Israel and Hezbollah [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1792.0s)]
*  so this can get worse and it's all the more reason to get this to a ceasefire because [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1797.3999999999999s)]
*  You know the worst-case outcomes that we've already seen [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1802.32s)]
*  You know could pale in comparison to the scale of suffering in Gaza with Rafa going forward or the scale of [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1805.88s)]
*  instability in the region if the you know, the Iranian response [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1812.6000000000001s)]
*  Precipitates, you know an even wider war. Yeah, so we have this wild story out of Ecuador that has created a diplomatic crisis all across Latin America [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1816.88s)]
*  Here is the backstory Ben. So last week [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1825.2s)]
*  Ecuadorian police broke into the Mexican Embassy in Quito and arrested a guy named Jorge glass [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1827.8400000000001s)]
*  He is Ecuador's former vice president glass is a leftist he served with President Correa from 2007 to 2017 [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1832.6399999999999s)]
*  Then he spent nearly five years in jail for corruption charges and was about to be arrested again [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1839.96s)]
*  When he entered the Mexican Embassy back in December according to the Financial Times glass was finally granted asylum on [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1845.12s)]
*  Friday and was reportedly about to flee the country with the Mexican ambassador when Ecuador security forces finally raided the embassy [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1852.36s)]
*  Now folks just know forcibly entering a foreign embassy is a huge deal [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1860.64s)]
*  It's a violation of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations, which is the foundational legal framework for all global diplomatic relations [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1864.92s)]
*  We discussed this a bit last week in the context of Israel bombing Iran's diplomatic [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1872.52s)]
*  Yeah, sure we did Syria and we said we were kind of concerned with this new norm your norm pretty big violation [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1877.76s)]
*  Yeah, but as you know, we noted like embassy grounds are legally considered to be that country's foreign soil [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1882.76s)]
*  So you could consider this an act of war? [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1887.08s)]
*  No one can enter an embassy without the ambassador's permission. So this raid, you know kicked up a shitstorm [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1889.1999999999998s)]
*  Mexico severed ties with Ecuador. They withdrew their diplomats [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1894.84s)]
*  The US condemned Ecuador's actions as did a bunch of countries in Latin America and Europe though [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1897.76s)]
*  I asked a lot of folks Daniel Niboa Ecuador's president is only 36 years old. He took office in November of last year [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1902.96s)]
*  He's the son of this billionaire, you know banana tycoon guy [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1909.9399999999998s)]
*  He was elected in a snap election to serve out the rest of the last president's term [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1913.84s)]
*  So he's gonna face elections again in 2025 [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1917.16s)]
*  Much like night Buckeye Lee and El Salvador Niboa has you know launched a war on drugs and on crime [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1921.0800000000002s)]
*  He's authoritarian but that has made him popular. So Ben [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1926.5600000000002s)]
*  It sounds so squishy and dorky to complain about violations at the Vienna [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1929.8400000000001s)]
*  Diplo speak but it is hard to convey how big of a deal this is and also, you know [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1936.3600000000001s)]
*  So two questions for you one take a swing at you know explaining that too. I wonder how much of this is [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1940.28s)]
*  Also a fracture along ideological lines because you have glass [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1946.56s)]
*  He's a leftist like omlo who is the most outraged about not only the the breach of his diplomatic facility [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1950.3999999999999s)]
*  But also sort of a fellow traveler getting caught up in raids and even a boa who's conservative and you know [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1956.8s)]
*  It's sort of a ideological opponent. But what do you think? [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1962.12s)]
*  It's just generally not a good thing to have this norm. I know the word norm sounds squishy [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1965.3999999999999s)]
*  I know the Vienna's convention sounds squishy [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1970.32s)]
*  This just doesn't happen though, this isn't like the kind of thing that periodically happens [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1973.1599999999999s)]
*  I mean we went through the Cold War like the Soviets didn't you know go into the US Embassy in Moscow [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1977.32s)]
*  Same thing vice versa. The US didn't do that in our country. We had a whole podcast on this feed [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1984.0s)]
*  About a Chinese dissident who went into the US Embassy in Beijing [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1990.36s)]
*  Right, like they didn't come get him out of there the Ecuadorians [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1993.8799999999999s)]
*  Ironically hosted Julian Assange people will recall in their embassy in London [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=1997.8600000000001s)]
*  And when the Brits suggested they might try to go in to get him [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2003.7800000000002s)]
*  There was a huge international uproar and rightly the Brits backed off, right? So this kind of allows for [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2007.3200000000002s)]
*  countries to have embassies in in [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2014.3000000000002s)]
*  Hostile or confrontational adversarial places and so if all of a sudden you can kick down the door of the embassy [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2018.0200000000002s)]
*  It becomes almost impossible to have an embassy somewhere other than like an allied nation, you know [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2024.4199999999998s)]
*  And then how can you conduct diplomacy with that? [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2028.98s)]
*  I mean diplomacy the ability of countries to sit down and negotiate things or just to have an embassy that you can help facilitate [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2032.34s)]
*  Visas and services for your citizenry. It depends on this norm being protected [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2039.1799999999998s)]
*  And I think that what is disturbing is this bukele model, right? [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2044.34s)]
*  You put your finger on it that that this guy is probably naboa is probably more popular for having done this [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2048.46s)]
*  I mean be interesting to watch that is what's the Ecuadorian public reaction? [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2054.1s)]
*  But bukele is kind of like this new guy young guy comes along and just breaking every rule [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2057.58s)]
*  Makes him seem like he's getting the shit done and I worry about a world in which the political lesson is oh that works [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2063.58s)]
*  And so the way for me to be popular is to come in break rules kick down embassy doors [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2069.86s)]
*  Arrest, you know my own Parliament, you know [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2075.66s)]
*  Just do extrajudicial things to show that I'm the man of action [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2078.78s)]
*  That that's a slippery slope here [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2082.82s)]
*  You know and not one that I think is good for Latin America or for and and I should say, you know [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2085.54s)]
*  Argentina's right-wing government [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2091.2200000000003s)]
*  They did condemn this however me like yeah [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2093.3s)]
*  It does kind of show [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2097.98s)]
*  That there's not it's not just the leftists in Latin America are upset about this [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2100.06s)]
*  Yeah, and like we're also we're obviously talking about this in a diplomatic context, but imagine all right [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2103.46s)]
*  Ecuador has a corruption problem [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2108.1s)]
*  Glass was got concurrent sentences totaling eight years. He served five [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2110.66s)]
*  He allegedly had a drug trafficker bribe a judge to get him released early [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2114.9399999999996s)]
*  And that's what he was about to be rearrested for the former president [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2119.7s)]
*  You know Correa was sentenced on corruption charges in absentia. It is currently chilling in Belgium hiding out [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2122.9199999999996s)]
*  So clearly there's a problem and clearly there's probably some resentment among elites. This is but we're talking about a diplomatic sort of [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2128.06s)]
*  Problem but like imagine if this kind of principle was applied in the US like it would have been great for Barack Obama [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2134.7799999999997s)]
*  To kick down a door on Wall Street in 2009. Yeah, grab a fucking banker [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2140.38s)]
*  Yeah, throw him in jail for you know [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2144.66s)]
*  A long time just to show a tough we were on corruption a lot of us would have loved to have done that [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2146.62s)]
*  It might have benefited the country but like you know [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2151.1s)]
*  You can't just act extra judicially whenever you want in service of your politics and it seems like that's what's happening [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2153.2999999999997s)]
*  You're like Bucaylee when he stormed [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2158.54s)]
*  Troops into the Parliament building. Yeah. Yeah, no, that's I mean wait till well not wait [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2161.54s)]
*  If if Donald Trump wins, you know, and you know, he starts kicking down doors and arresting people [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2166.9s)]
*  That might be super popular with his base, but you know mid-quick and media a little difficult workplace, you know [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2172.74s)]
*  but it's like [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2180.9s)]
*  When such a dangerous populist moment because people are right to be pissed you're right [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2183.2599999999998s)]
*  Like I'm sure this guy's corrupt, you know, but that doesn't mean you kick down the embassy door and and and so the question is [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2187.7799999999997s)]
*  Is this populism gonna be a wave that kind of crashes over any boundary? [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2194.14s)]
*  It's shocking to me that these boundaries kind of held by and large [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2198.58s)]
*  I mean all across the board through like the Cold War, you know, and and but in this kind of weird world [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2202.54s)]
*  We're now it's like no all bets are off crazy story. This guy's now sitting in like a supermax prison [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2207.3599999999997s)]
*  yeah, the pictures I mean the pictures of this guy getting dragged away by like [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2213.54s)]
*  super [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2218.02s)]
*  Armed dudes like military. Yeah. Yeah, and they roughed up the Mexican staff [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2219.14s)]
*  I shouldn't laugh. I know is quite often just is so crazy. I know you bust in you beat up some [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2224.8199999999997s)]
*  God it's what a what a world but I again, I think this is the bukele model, you know [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2231.18s)]
*  This is what's happening Mexico clearly like the bigger fish in this fight to you. Anyway, okay. Well, they got cartels [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2235.62s)]
*  I mean, there's a cartel problem. It says, you know, it's sure as the Mexican cartels are reactive in Ecuador [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2241.9599999999996s)]
*  So yeah, Ricardo [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2247.52s)]
*  Explain that to us. Okay a lot of updates on Ukraine which we haven't talked about in a minute [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2249.52s)]
*  So Ben the first is that the Washington Post got a hold or wind of Trump's secret plan for Ukraine such as it is [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2253.74s)]
*  Not really a plan. It is also kind of exactly what we expected [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2260.24s)]
*  Trump according to the post would force Ukraine to cede control of Crimea and the Donbass region in eastern Russia in eastern Ukraine [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2264.56s)]
*  Limit NATO expansion and then there's some nonsense in this story about quote [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2271.56s)]
*  Enticing Putin to loosen his growing reliance on China. So that's part of this [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2276.4s)]
*  So basically it's capitulation it's freezing the lines where they were it's giving Russia another win on NATO and it's pretending Putin [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2282.92s)]
*  Would agree to stop working with China no explanation for how you actually do any of this [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2288.6s)]
*  How you actually forced Ukraine or Europe to stop fighting? [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2293.24s)]
*  back here in reality [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2297.08s)]
*  President Zelensky signed a law that lowers the military conscription age in Ukraine from 27 to 25 and gets rid of some drafting [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2299.08s)]
*  Exemptions the AP quoted an analyst saying that the change would add about 50,000 troops to the Ukrainian military [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2306.04s)]
*  Which is about a tenth of what Zelensky said he needed I think in December of last year [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2311.44s)]
*  Also, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was damaged in a drone strike over the weekend [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2316.84s)]
*  So add nuclear meltdowns in Ukraine back to your list of bedtime anxieties. I remember that one early on [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2321.36s)]
*  Finally the Washington Post reported on leaked internal Russian documents that detail their PR campaign to influence US lawmakers [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2327.56s)]
*  And prevent the US from giving more support to Ukraine [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2335.2999999999997s)]
*  Here's a clip of Republican Congressman Mike Turner chairman of the House Intelligence Committee on CNN talking about it [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2338.7s)]
*  We see directly coming from Russia [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2345.2s)]
*  attempts to mask communications that are anti Ukraine and [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2348.42s)]
*  Pro-russia messages some of which we even hear being uttered on the House floor [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2351.94s)]
*  I mean there are members of Congress today who still incorrectly say that this conflict between Russia and Ukraine is over NATO [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2355.58s)]
*  Which of course it is not [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2361.18s)]
*  Vladimir Putin having made it very clear both publicly into his own population that his his view is that this is a conflict of a [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2363.22s)]
*  much broader claim of Russia to Eastern Europe and including claiming all of Ukraine territory as Russia's [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2370.7799999999997s)]
*  To the extent that this propaganda takes hold [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2378.2999999999997s)]
*  It makes it more difficult for us to really see this as an authoritarian versus democracy battle [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2381.3399999999997s)]
*  Which is what it is [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2387.14s)]
*  So [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2387.78s)]
*  Speaker of the house Mike Johnson is reportedly told donors that he wants to get Ukraine funding passed [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2388.7400000000002s)]
*  But the political reality is that Marjorie Taylor Green has threatened to oust him as speaker if he moves forward with Ukraine funding [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2393.78s)]
*  So she could be the one who ultimately decides whether the US supports her abandon these guys. What a world [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2401.32s)]
*  Yeah, and she's the kind of person that like repeats, you know, it's not just the NATO point. I mean there's been cases of [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2407.5400000000004s)]
*  Republican members of Congress like literally retweeting like Russian propaganda [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2414.76s)]
*  Yeah, you had David Cameron [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2421.44s)]
*  The Foreign Secretary and former prime minister of the UK flying to Mar-a-Lago to try to you know [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2423.76s)]
*  Unlock the supplemental that that's weird. Oh, that was he he was lobbying for this [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2429.76s)]
*  He was a little like he was lobbying Trump to lobby John or to tell Johnson that it's okay to let this pass [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2434.64s)]
*  You know interesting and that just shows you where we're at interesting how strange this is and and the thing about Trump that [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2439.96s)]
*  You know, this plan is is nonsensical, right? [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2446.28s)]
*  The the Ukrainians would never agree to it [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2449.36s)]
*  It's not America doesn't have the capacity to like deliver Eastern Ukraine and Crimea to Putin [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2451.7400000000002s)]
*  And the idea that that Russia is gonna get any less close to China when in fact Russia's gotten much more [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2457.56s)]
*  Dependent on China throughout this war for all their technology and all their economy essentially [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2463.64s)]
*  It just shows like that they're living this other planet [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2468.8s)]
*  I do just wish like something has disappeared which is some regard for the Ukrainian people [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2471.1600000000003s)]
*  I mean the people that are living in Russian occupied territories, particularly in in the Donbass [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2477.2000000000003s)]
*  You know their children being stolen and sent into Russia that we've seen reports of war crimes [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2482.96s)]
*  So this isn't just like a casual game of risk, you know where it's like, right? [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2487.84s)]
*  I will move our piece off this part of the board [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2491.48s)]
*  I mean, they're their real lives at stake here and I do worry with the you saw these [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2493.4s)]
*  You know as the front lines frozen, you know, the nuclear plan is the extreme case, but the Russians are now trying to essentially [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2498.28s)]
*  Decapitate Ukrainian energy you got the Ukrainians hitting Russian refineries [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2506.76s)]
*  This war could continue to kind of escalate in strange ways [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2510.8s)]
*  In the in the coming months here [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2514.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2516.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean this was this week was the two-year anniversary of the Russians finally pulling out of Buccia [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2516.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah that city near Kiev where there were just horrible atrocities committed war crimes by Russian troops [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2521.96s)]
*  Indiscriminate massacring of Ukrainian civilians. So that speaks to why it would be politically impossible for Zelensky [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2528.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah to just say oh, yeah, absolutely. You could have the Donbass [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2535.1000000000004s)]
*  And also, you know to your point though about like what is doing to society the average soldier on both sides is over 40 [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2537.84s)]
*  the Ukrainians are worried about lowering the draft age because basically if they take too many young people out of [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2544.44s)]
*  Their economy out of the workforce the country just won't be able to continue going [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2550.4s)]
*  Won't have an economy anymore, yeah in Russia meanwhile says 16,000 people signed up [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2555.08s)]
*  For the military in the wake of the Moscow concert call attack. So they're not having these [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2560.08s)]
*  Problems of recruiting or at least recruiting in air quotes. Yeah [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2566.6s)]
*  Conscripting soldiers into their armed forces. Yeah, and but the Russians have their own problems [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2571.4s)]
*  I mean there was a great report in the New York Times of the weekend about all these convicts that they brought into the [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2575.76s)]
*  Russian military in the Wagner group offensive [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2581.8199999999997s)]
*  Some of them have now returned back to communities and guess what they're doing [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2584.7799999999997s)]
*  They're killing people and these are people that are already, you know killers or criminals before and God knows what kind of [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2587.66s)]
*  Things they saw on the front line [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2593.98s)]
*  You're gonna have deeply traumatized [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2596.42s)]
*  communities in in both countries and obviously are some of these are with [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2599.5s)]
*  Ukraine because Russia's the aggressor [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2604.46s)]
*  That are gonna reverberate for years and decades to come yeah two more quick things [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2606.66s)]
*  So again Marjorie Taylor green might be the one who decides whether the US supports Ukraine or not [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2611.28s)]
*  On April 5th the day of the DC earthquake [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2616.18s)]
*  She tweeted God is sending America strong signs to tell us to repent earthquakes and eclipses and many more things to come [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2618.6s)]
*  I pray that our country listens. So good to know this is in her hands. Also Ben. Here's a clip [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2624.06s)]
*  from the new Republican National Committee chairman Michael Watley [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2629.5s)]
*  From some TV show look I think that we are seeing right now that this election truly truly matters on [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2633.86s)]
*  National security on every one of these issues when America is weak [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2640.7s)]
*  The world is a far more dangerous place and right now Joe Biden's feckless leadership has shown [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2644.5s)]
*  China has shown Ukraine has shown Iran that they can feel free to be much more aggressive on the world front to the point [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2650.78s)]
*  Where even they will try and meddle with our elections here [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2657.7400000000002s)]
*  Maybe as a Freudian slip or maybe he really thinks Ukraine is an aggressor that needs to be confronted [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2660.6s)]
*  Not a country that was invaded. It's what they I mean, it's what they think [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2665.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean they they they remember the the what about ism on Russian interference [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2669.2799999999997s)]
*  Is that the Ukrainians that actually interfere remember they had the DNC server? [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2674.64s)]
*  I mean, there's a broken brain syndrome on the right about the Ukrainians that that is totally bizarre [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2677.88s)]
*  You know, they think they're anti-christian [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2685.52s)]
*  There have been all these conspiracy theories about Zelensky and you know what like he's persecuting Christians and he's persecuting journalists again [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2687.76s)]
*  There's like there's a weird information [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2694.88s)]
*  Information stream whatever their information sources. It's not this podcast [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2697.92s)]
*  Yeah [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2702.0s)]
*  It does explain why Mike Turner the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee went on CNN to say some of his colleagues are [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2702.4s)]
*  Repeating Russian propaganda. I think we just heard a couple of them there [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2708.94s)]
*  Okay, so Ben we've also been watching how the war in Ukraine impacts politics across Europe [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2712.1600000000003s)]
*  And there's some bad news out of Slovakia where a pro-russian candidate named Peter Pellegrini [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2716.68s)]
*  Won the presidential election on Sunday with nearly 54% of the vote the position of president doesn't have much power in Slovakia [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2721.56s)]
*  But he's an ally of the pro-russian prime minister Robert Fico who halted Slovakia's arm shipments to Ukraine [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2728.36s)]
*  Pellegrini says Slovakia is gonna stay the course. They're gonna be in the EU [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2735.44s)]
*  They're gonna stay in NATO [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2739.4s)]
*  But it is an indication of the strength of the argument the nationalist isolationist message in parts of Europe [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2740.36s)]
*  So not great for the Ukrainian side and again just like a data point [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2747.36s)]
*  We're watching as we head into these European parliamentary elections in June [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2751.36s)]
*  Yeah [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2754.52s)]
*  I know and I was in Bratislava the capital Slovakia a few months ago right after the prime minister was elected and [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2755.04s)]
*  There was a real sense of foreboding there and part of what happens is you have you know, Bratislava is the kind of more urban [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2761.28s)]
*  You know [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2767.2000000000003s)]
*  Globalist if you will [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2768.72s)]
*  Capital of the country but then out in these rural areas you have right-wing Russian-backed media [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2771.72s)]
*  You know, you've got a lot of forces coming in to support this. It's it's happening in part [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2776.9599999999996s)]
*  Yes, there's some fatigue or fear about supporting Ukraine, but there's also a lot of effort being put into kind of turning [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2782.8399999999997s)]
*  segments of these populations to this kind of urbanist [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2790.6s)]
*  Worldview and you know Slovakia bordering Hungary there if they become kind of part of a growing block of countries [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2794.76s)]
*  That are in the kind of more more pro-russian camp more hostiles of the EU that gets really complicated [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2800.6800000000003s)]
*  And the reality is to the EU [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2807.92s)]
*  Depends on kind of consensus decision-making, right? [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2810.44s)]
*  You know as is NATO by the way, which we saw Erdogan holding up [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2812.84s)]
*  You know the cession of Sweden if enough of these countries start just kind of throwing sand in the gears [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2815.86s)]
*  It could also really mess up the functioning of Europe. So this is not not it's not an unexpected development, but it's not a good one [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2820.8s)]
*  Yeah, no or bond can screw up the EU for everybody [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2827.2400000000002s)]
*  Imagine if there's a bunch of a bunch of little mini or bonds. Yeah, not great [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2829.92s)]
*  Let's turn back to the US Ben because president Biden is hosting Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida for a state visit on Wednesday [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2833.32s)]
*  He will also host a trilateral summit with the US Japan and the Philippines on Thursday [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2840.48s)]
*  Japan is Biden's fifth state visit the US and Japan [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2845.44s)]
*  They're gonna talk about military cooperation space cooperation. Apparently Japan wants to put an astronaut on the moon. So do it [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2848.76s)]
*  Let's do it. Yeah, they'll hash out a disagreement over whether a Japanese company is gonna be allowed to take over the US Steel Corporation [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2854.36s)]
*  See about that the trilateral meeting is gonna it's like I don't know do we care an election area? [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2861.44s)]
*  Yeah, probably not the trilateral meeting will focus primarily on China [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2866.7200000000003s)]
*  Ben so the Biden team has put a lot of time into bolstering these alliance in the Asia Pacific the US [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2871.48s)]
*  India Australia Japan they call it the quad. I remember there being another quad, but whatever. Yeah [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2876.84s)]
*  They also did a bunch of work trying to calm tensions between Japan and South Korea [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2882.48s)]
*  How you feeling about the Indo-Pacific these days bolstered robust? I feel like there's a [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2886.96s)]
*  Word, I think there's a series of robust partnerships that are creating synergies and a network among our alliances [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2892.7999999999997s)]
*  In the region that have never been stronger. This is hard because it's really important, but it's so [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2899.4s)]
*  No, the reality what's interesting is two things one is they clearly you want Japan and Japan is wants to [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2904.16s)]
*  Play this kind of more assertive role like and you saw the Japanese Prime Minister, you know [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2911.7999999999997s)]
*  Talking about in bolstering defense spending and this is a country with a fundamentally pacifist constitution [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2916.62s)]
*  Largely written, you know with the an American looking over their shoulder after World War two and and you feel like Japan is now [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2922.08s)]
*  You know looking at the threat from China and North Korea and saying hey [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2930.0600000000004s)]
*  We we're gonna get more on our front foot here in terms of defense spending and being a defense [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2933.94s)]
*  Partner not just the United States, but the Philippines meeting is interesting right because the Philippines has this [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2938.6200000000003s)]

*  Defense build up in Japan and what that does in the region it shows you that that the concerns about China [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2982.9s)]
*  Are not limited to the United States, frankly, right? Yeah, some long-term risk to a military buildup in Japan. Yeah [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=2988.5s)]

*  Without the kind of like extreme rhetoric and extrajudicial killing of Duterte. It's interesting how much they have kind of [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3016.98s)]
*  You know embraced Marcos not maybe embraces a strong word but like they've definitely saw [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3024.54s)]

*  Please listen, but some of MBS is ideas are smart. They do need to diversify the country's [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3052.12s)]
*  Economy away from fossil fuels others are [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3058.52s)]
*  Ridiculous boondoggles. My favorite such boondoggle. Yeah is a project called the line [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3061.72s)]
*  Which is conceived of being one day a 105 mile long linear city [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3066.52s)]
*  So imagine a building longer than the distance between New York and Philly that is taller [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3072.4s)]
*  Than the Empire State Building. So Ben you'll be shocked to learn that this project is behind schedule [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3078.56s)]
*  The government wanted to have 1.5 million people living in the line city building by 2030 [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3085.4s)]
*  They've scaled back that ambition to less than 300,000 and now only 2.4 of the planned [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3091.48s)]
*  170 kilometers will be done by 2030. So very sad news for [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3097.84s)]
*  Consultants everywhere who want to get paid for this thing [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3103.2000000000003s)]
*  This is just it continues to be the craziest story out there in a lot of ways because it is just clearly like Mohammed bin Salman [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3107.1200000000003s)]
*  You know, like he's a Roman Emperor who wants to just like leave some physical manifestation of his greatness behind [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3114.4399999999996s)]
*  Yeah, and I don't know what on earth you saw what sci-fi movie or PowerPoint? [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3120.48s)]
*  presentation [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3127.3999999999996s)]
*  This is a 1.5 trillion dollar project [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3128.7999999999997s)]
*  I think when you add up the whole cost at budget [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3131.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah at budget at budget like that there'd be no overruns to actually know this vision [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3134.56s)]
*  And and to what purpose does this serve like, you know? [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3138.96s)]

*  Nominated in the pre meeting to be the one who has to go tell MBS. Hey that like cool [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3159.76s)]
*  You know model we showed you is is actually gonna be [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3164.96s)]
*  You know one what a one-third the size if that you pick the guy with the Kevlar vest on go from there [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3168.5s)]
*  Yeah, I wouldn't want to deliver that news. I mean you're right though. It is it is pyramid like yeah, it's crazy [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3174.72s)]
*  Like yeah, I mean we interviewed Ben Hubbard about this New York Times writer Istanbul bureau chief wrote one of the best books [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3179.46s)]

*  Well, you know cities like Jeddah or you know, they just like don't have good sewer systems [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3188.1s)]
*  I mean you could improve the quality of life of citizens so easily just by [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3192.9s)]
*  Refurbishing the things you have instead of this neon project which also includes a plan to [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3196.22s)]
*  Create man-made snow on mountains in Saudi Arabia so that you can ski three months a year basis [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3202.1s)]
*  Yeah, so MBS and you know his real family types can go ski. Yeah, it's just [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3207.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you could spend a trillion dollars making people's lives a lot better, you know, and they have a large young population in Saudi Arabia, but [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3214.66s)]
*  Or you could build neom or whatever is called he's also like MBS seems like a smart enough guy actually [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3222.38s)]
*  I think he is a smart guy [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3228.34s)]
*  How do you not know this is a bullshit idea? Well, he had it pretty like, you know, he [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3230.02s)]

*  It's got their autocrat to try this right like in Burma [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3239.86s)]
*  They built an entirely new city because some astrologer told them it was unsafe to live in the current capital [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3242.2200000000003s)]

*  right to the government buildings from the airport and we're driving like a hundred miles an hour or something because it's like a [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3260.06s)]
*  It's like a 20 lane highway. I can't tell you why this thing is with no cars on it, you know [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3266.18s)]
*  Not a best in a country where people are starving, you know, I got a feeling they'll be like [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3272.3399999999997s)]
*  One kilometer of line building that will live in the desert. Yeah, I mean the emirate is like like they when they're not kind of financing [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3277.62s)]

*  I mean, I guess they don't have a lot of land to use but I mean build up Riyadh or Jeddah [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3289.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean, yeah, I don't get it man [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3294.14s)]

*  Thanks to be truly stupid now deleted Tory party tweet [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3301.02s)]
*  So this was it was a subtext in an image the image they put out looked like [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3304.3199999999997s)]
*  Kind of like a garage sale poster you might have made in high school with like clip art on your you know home computer [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3309.24s)]
*  It said quote Britain is the second most powerful country in the world. It included photos of Rishi Sunak [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3315.9199999999996s)]

*  Director whose name is escaping me [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3332.6s)]
*  So people on social media pointed out that one of the fighter planes featured was an f-35 which is made by the US [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3334.4s)]
*  That the poster was supposed to be about the United Kingdom [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3342.56s)]
*  But it only includes the English soccer team and the photo they used of the team was from a game [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3345.6s)]
*  They just lost to Brazil. So I guess in fairness that does fit well at the number two narrative [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3351.1600000000003s)]
*  There's no women featured [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3355.6400000000003s)]

*  the head of the International Rescue Committee former Foreign Secretary of the UK and [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3612.98s)]
*  A leading voice on all manner of international issues David. Thanks so much for joining us. Of course Ben [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3618.34s)]
*  Thanks. Thanks for having me on so want to start with the situation Gaza [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3623.9s)]
*  IRC has obviously been active as one of the leading [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3629.1800000000003s)]
*  humanitarian organizations in the world [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3632.9s)]
*  Before we get into some of the specific issues that have obviously been front-and-center [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3635.46s)]
*  Just what is your sense of the current state of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and how is the IRC? [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3639.62s)]
*  On the ground trying to address some of these needs. Well, sadly, it's very simple to describe [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3647.5s)]
*  it's a catastrophe that's getting worse and [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3652.9s)]
*  What we know is that there's no precedent for a country that had no famine [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3657.18s)]
*  To turn into a situation where half the population are facing literally famine in the space of six months [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3663.26s)]
*  But that's happened in the Gaza example [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3669.1s)]
*  You'll have seen two or three weeks ago the International Phase Classification, which is a very conservative small-sea conservative [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3671.86s)]
*  technical technocratic institution that has assessed half of the population are at International Phase Classification level 5 which is catastrophic levels of hunger [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3677.98s)]
*  And the rest of the population at levels 3 & 4 which are crisis and emergency and the situation is getting worse because [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3687.82s)]
*  Famines happen slowly [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3696.5s)]
*  but they then are very hard to turn around and [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3698.66s)]
*  It's beyond [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3702.94s)]
*  Awful that there were announcements on Friday that there would be a new crossing opened in Erez [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3705.3s)]
*  that there'd be a new access from the [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3712.38s)]
*  Port of Ashdod, but there's been no benefit I checked with our teams overnight. There's no benefit of that. And so what you're seeing is [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3715.7799999999997s)]
*  famine [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3723.8199999999997s)]
*  Death on a very large scale 33,000 people directly from the fighting [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3725.02s)]
*  Desperation and then of course all of the illness that goes with those kind of conditions because it's a public health emergency and [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3731.1s)]
*  Those factors produce massive disorder as well [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3740.42s)]
*  And so I listened to or yeah was on I think was in the Economist this week some that there was a quote of someone who's [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3743.1800000000003s)]
*  Just gone back to their house in Khan Eunice a Palestinian civilian and he said [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3748.98s)]
*  we are [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3755.42s)]
*  It's life as if we were dead. Hmm, and I think that brings home quite what a [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3756.82s)]
*  Humanitarian catastrophe this is before we get into policy to in just in terms of the IRC [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3762.46s)]
*  Give us a sense of what the IRC has been doing in Gaza [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3767.26s)]
*  But also like how do you make judgments as you know, the leader of this organization? [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3770.58s)]
*  We saw what happened to the World Central Kitchen with their people getting killed. I know you guys have had some [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3775.6200000000003s)]
*  You know some Israeli military [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3783.82s)]
*  Some of the Israeli military operation come your way [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3786.7000000000003s)]
*  What is the how do you make decisions about? [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3789.46s)]
*  Obviously the whole purpose of your organization you wanted to make decisions about [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3792.7000000000003s)]
*  Organization you want to help people but you also have responsibility not put your people at risk [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3795.82s)]
*  How do you what are you doing? And then how do you think through those trade-offs? Yeah, that's a great question [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3801.6200000000003s)]
*  It's one obviously we we think about a lot and fear a lot and there's no world where we work [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3806.98s)]
*  Where there isn't heightened risk and the question is do you have the systems to manage the risk? [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3812.5400000000004s)]
*  We are now into our fifth emergency medical team, which we run with medical aid for the Palestinians who are a UK based charity [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3817.44s)]
*  We have between eight and fifteen doctors who go and work at various hospitals in Gaza [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3824.2s)]
*  we also partner with a range of local NGOs who are trying to [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3831.08s)]
*  distribute non-food items [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3838.04s)]
*  Who are trying to do child protection and women's protection work else around the Gaza Strip? [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3839.8799999999997s)]
*  We did have a Israeli missile hit our guest house on the 18th of January [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3846.04s)]
*  And we said at the time that this showed that the so-called deconfliction system the system by which NGOs tell [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3851.4s)]
*  Competence tell the Israeli authorities in this case [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3858.96s)]
*  Where they are and what their movements are going to be we said it's not working and it's a threat to life and limb at [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3862.32s)]
*  The time I think the death toll among aid workers was around 150 as you'll know the death toll is now over 200 [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3867.32s)]
*  Am I'd workers post the World Central Kitchen event and the deconfliction system simply doesn't work. So we've had to [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3873.8s)]
*  more and more our [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3881.2000000000003s)]
*  Medical team to take that as an example that they find a place to sleep in the hospital [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3883.28s)]
*  They don't leave the hospital. So even guest houses that have been deconflicted which ours was turned out not to be safe and [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3887.92s)]
*  all to all to say that the most basic legal rights of an aid worker to stay alive and a [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3895.52s)]
*  Civilian caught up in war to receive aid are not being honored in this conflict. And so it couldn't be more serious [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3902.8s)]
*  informs our call for a ceasefire on humanitarian grounds a [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3910.56s)]
*  Sustain an immediate but also sustain ceasefire to allow us to do humanitarian work [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3915.2799999999997s)]
*  But it also informs the calls that we're making [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3920.2s)]
*  In the absence of a ceasefire without in any way diminishing our call for a ceasefire for aid to flow in [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3923.92s)]
*  massively greater quantities because it's it's human decisions [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3930.52s)]
*  sometimes bureaucratic sometimes political that are preventing the flow of aid but also [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3934.52s)]
*  More protection for aid workers. You just spoke to a piece of this that I think is important to highlight which is [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3938.96s)]
*  You know, I remember when I was in government you have deconfliction set up to facilitate the delivery of aid in conflict zones [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3947.2799999999997s)]
*  There are legal requirements international legal requirements that go along with that, right? [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3954.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean what what is the the interaction between the obligation to? [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3959.3199999999997s)]
*  Facilitate aid and to pursue deconfliction measures with international law [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3964.72s)]
*  Well, there are international law as you know has four elements to do with military necessity to do with [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3968.8599999999997s)]
*  proportionality to do with distinction between [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3976.0s)]
*  civilians and [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3979.04s)]
*  Competence and to do with [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3981.4399999999996s)]
*  Humanity and that is a well-developed case law [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3983.9199999999996s)]
*  What I would say is that we need an absolute paradigm shift 180 degrees shift in the way [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3988.1600000000003s)]
*  We understand the rights of civilians and aid workers and their rights to receive aid [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3993.82s)]
*  which is that their their protection from danger and damage and their rights to [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=3999.6800000000003s)]
*  Receive aid is not a gift of conflict parties [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4007.6000000000004s)]
*  We've got ourselves into a mindset where we should be grateful that aid is allowed to get through no no no no [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4012.0s)]
*  It's the opposite. There is a responsibility on conflict parties to enable aid to go through and a long time ago [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4018.44s)]
*  We said that the conduct of all parties to this conflict was not honoring those most fundamental commitments [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4025.7200000000003s)]
*  And it's very very important that they are because we know it's not just in Gaza that impunity is raining [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4032.7200000000003s)]
*  It's it's much more wide widely spread and this idea that somehow the protection of civilians or [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4039.8s)]
*  The distribution of aid is something that is a gift a generous gift is just wrong one more piece of this is [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4046.6000000000004s)]
*  Obviously, you know, you've called for a ceasefire [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4052.6400000000003s)]
*  You've talked about these different prongs the need for a ceasefire the need to get aid in [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4055.92s)]
*  Obviously need to comply with international law [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4060.7200000000003s)]
*  It's not though like even if you got to ceasefire that the needs would immediately go away [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4062.96s)]
*  Have you been able to think through it all the medium and longer-term challenges in Gaza that might be confronting the IRC in the international community [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4067.24s)]
*  If we do get to a ceasefire, I mean, I think that the short answer is obviously no because there are so many [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4074.24s)]
*  imponderables, I mean the scale of destruction is absolutely massive the [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4080.56s)]
*  Psychological damage matches the physical damage. We don't know what security arrangements will be in place [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4087.2799999999997s)]
*  You're seeing in the north how difficult that is and [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4093.76s)]
*  Obviously, we're still in a situation where we don't know if this rafa [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4097.4400000000005s)]
*  Offensive is going to go ahead and so all of those factors make it very very hard to think what we know is it [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4101.4400000000005s)]
*  If you think about it for those two million people [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4109.2s)]
*  What they face is the biggest reconstruction job that has existed for generations [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4112.400000000001s)]
*  It's not necessarily the largest number of people who are affected by conflict [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4118.08s)]
*  I mean the conflict in Sudan there's 25 million people in humanitarian need [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4121.44s)]
*  But it's an absolutely massive challenge. What we know is something that's important which we're trying to [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4126.16s)]
*  Spread at the World Bank spring meetings and elsewhere [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4131.5199999999995s)]
*  Effective humanitarian aid is the first step on the road to development stopping people dying is the first step on the road to development [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4134.4s)]
*  basic early childhood [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4140.879999999999s)]
*  interventions to help tackle the trauma that's being faced by young people is [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4143.04s)]
*  Step one the the the tackling of the malnutrition [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4147.599999999999s)]
*  I mean, this is why I started this interview by talking about the famine and malnutrition [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4150.96s)]
*  That's the apex of the pyramid if you like we know that in humanitarian emergencies where there's famine or malnutrition everything else is going wrong [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4154.4s)]
*  As well and obviously Gaza is very unusual in that no one can get out and it's practically impossible to get aid in [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4162.16s)]
*  But we know that these conditions have long-term consequences [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4169.36s)]
*  Yeah, you said I mean one other thing I think that come out of your question you mentioned rafa, I mean [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4173.04s)]
*  It's almost hard to imagine [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4178.8s)]
*  People keep not being able to envision how this could get worse, but I I kind of can't [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4180.8s)]
*  Get my mind around what the situation might look like in the Gaza Strip if that rafa operation goes forward, right? [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4185.92s)]
*  I mean it just it would exponentially complicate everything from aid delivery to [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4191.28s)]
*  immediate needs to freedom of movement for organizations like the United States [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4196.16s)]
*  It's from a humanitarian point of view it's clear look there's a million plus people [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4200.0s)]
*  Who have all pretty much all been moved already once twice three times [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4204.56s)]
*  The scale of loss already is very very high [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4211.2s)]
*  There was a story today that forty thousand tenths have been procured, but there's a million plus people in the rafa. Yeah, and so [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4213.52s)]
*  That's why there's such grave grave trepidation [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4221.6s)]
*  Fear about what's next? [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4225.52s)]
*  Well pulling back the lens obviously the rest of the world doesn't stop [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4227.52s)]
*  Suffering from conflict and humanitarian crises in the midst of what's happening in Gaza [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4232.4800000000005s)]
*  I know irc has been quite active in Sudan [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4237.68s)]
*  The situation that I think in more normal times would be getting a lot of attention [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4241.52s)]
*  How would you describe for people what the the needs are there? What are the needs of the people? [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4246.160000000001s)]
*  What's happening in the civil war in Sudan and how that's kind of spilling over into places like south Sudan [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4250.96s)]
*  Yeah, there's a couple of things to say actually which speak to the wider global sense of I call it a flammable world [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4256.16s)]
*  I mean the world's on fire in various places and it's very flammable [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4262.24s)]
*  And we we produce an annual emergency watch list gaza was number two gaza west bank were number two sudan was number one [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4265.76s)]
*  As I said earlier twenty five years ago [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4272.88s)]
*  I mean I was in south sudan in february and I met a couple who I went to the border or near the border and [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4274.88s)]
*  a couple of flents [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4281.68s)]
*  700 miles from cartou 700 kilometers from Khartoum. She was a hairdresser [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4283.36s)]
*  He was a shoemaker their kids were meant to be going to university [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4288.0s)]
*  And she was a hairdresser. She was a hairdresser. She was a hairdresser [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4291.6s)]
*  She was a hairdresser. She was a hairdresser [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4295.52s)]
*  She was a hairdresser [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4298.08s)]
*  She was a hairdresser he was a shoemaker their kids were meant to be going to university and now they're wondering whether they'll ever go back to their [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4300.0s)]
*  country [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4307.68s)]
*  Um, I think there's a couple of aspects of it that are very striking one. This is not just a sudan crisis [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4308.8s)]
*  It's a sudan south sudan chad. It's the whole of northeast africa [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4314.08s)]
*  crisis [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4318.96s)]
*  and [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4320.96s)]
*  The the second is that those who are much more expert than I in what happened in darfur 20 years ago [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4322.64s)]
*  Will tell you that there are very very dark and chilling echoes in what's happening now [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4329.2s)]
*  Of what happened then so you've got number one. It's it's affecting the neighbors massively sudan [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4333.76s)]
*  South sudan secondly the darfur [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4340.24s)]
*  Element this thirdly every humanitarian emergency is a political emergency. Yeah, and the political emergency in this case [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4342.72s)]
*  Is that you have different regional powers? [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4349.52s)]
*  supporting different sides [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4352.78s)]
*  You have the situation where authority for peacemaking has been devolved from the un security council to the african union [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4354.78s)]
*  So you've got a different set of [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4364.0599999999995s)]
*  uh plays there [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4365.9s)]
*  Which is very involved with different strands of african politics [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4368.38s)]
*  Tying into middle eastern politics because of saudi arabia and united arabia is both very involved egypt [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4372.38s)]
*  And so this political emergency is creating this sense of vacuum where people are really asking whether the country is going to exist [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4378.3s)]
*  after this yeah [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4384.8s)]
*  And and and you i mean you've written and talked a lot about a kind of culture of impunity here [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4386.32s)]
*  um [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4391.12s)]
*  and and oftentimes [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4392.48s)]
*  We end up focusing on you know, the worst actors right the people [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4394.4s)]
*  The militias or the warlords or the warring parties in a civil war [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4398.96s)]
*  um [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4403.12s)]
*  But as you mentioned, there's also these regional powers that are arming different sides backing different sides [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4404.16s)]
*  You know and some of those are you know actors like the emirates the uae that are [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4410.58s)]
*  You know very plugged into global politics. I mean, how do we? [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4414.98s)]
*  try to align [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4419.7s)]
*  Some sense of accountability or some sense of pressure or some sense of incentive [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4421.78s)]
*  for these kind of regional parties in a conflict like sudan [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4426.26s)]
*  um to take more responsibility for [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4429.46s)]
*  For their own choices here [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4432.26s)]
*  I mean to turn off the spigot of weapons and get to the table [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4433.62s)]
*  Of negotiation rather than to just kind of let these fires burn [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4437.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think the starting point is actually getting our own house in order now in this one can [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4440.76s)]
*  Actually point to something that the biden administration done. That's very significant and very positive, which is their own new [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4445.72s)]
*  department of defense guidance [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4450.76s)]
*  on [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4452.68s)]
*  Civilian protection in military operations does actually set a very high standard for what should be expected not just of the u.s [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4453.48s)]
*  But of all its security partners. Yeah, and that's I think really [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4459.64s)]
*  Important secondly to get active on the diplomatic front now there is now a new special envoy [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4463.34s)]
*  Tom pierello is the special envoy [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4469.5s)]
*  For the crisis that's good because it needs the weight of the u.s [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4472.22s)]
*  If there's going to be any diplomatic progress at all thirdly. It's we're back to our old friend [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4476.14s)]
*  leverage [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4482.14s)]
*  And it's about prioritization and leverage and the extent to which then which is which that is used [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4483.26s)]
*  The u.s. Has a number of allies who are engaged in this [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4488.700000000001s)]
*  Conflict the internationalization of this civil war is symptomatic of something that's happening right around the world with civil wars that are burning longer [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4491.84s)]
*  with more [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4500.08s)]
*  ferocity because of external sponsorship [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4501.28s)]
*  And so the u.s. Needs to use its leverage [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4505.12s)]
*  I would argue the west needs to use its leverage more generally and that I wanted to ask you you have a piece out in the [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4507.52s)]
*  Guardian recently that people should check out about the role of uk [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4512.4800000000005s)]
*  And this is an interesting point for the uk we're you know out of brexit a couple years or a few years now [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4516.98s)]
*  You also have an election coming up there [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4523.46s)]
*  David Cameron's flying off tomorrow. I go to meet with Donald Trump. That's a little peculiar [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4526.98s)]
*  He survived. I think he survived. He's had to have been sighting. He's been said. Okay, he's out [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4532.38s)]
*  But what it would you know, the you're not the uk is not part of the EU anymore. Obviously, it's [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4538.259999999999s)]
*  It's kind of floating in this new space [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4544.44s)]
*  I mean you you you know break down for people kind of the role that you see [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4548.679999999999s)]
*  That the uk should be playing in this world of increasing disorder of increasing risk [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4553.4s)]
*  um [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4557.88s)]
*  In a post brexit foreign policy and maybe maybe post tori foreign policy. Well fingers crossed [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4559.08s)]
*  um [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4565.639999999999s)]
*  Look the the uk [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4566.759999999999s)]
*  There are many of us who warned [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4569.08s)]
*  That brexit would be an act of unilateral political disarm [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4571.26s)]
*  And i'm very very sad that in all sorts of ways that's proved to be true. However, brexit is much worse [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4575.26s)]
*  Than even I predicted on the foreign policy front. It's actually [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4582.0599999999995s)]
*  very bad on the economic front [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4586.46s)]
*  as well [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4588.54s)]
*  And I think the uk now finds itself in a position [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4589.5s)]
*  Where it has effectively no relations on the foreign policy and defense front with the european union [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4594.38s)]
*  And it's got all of its chips in the nato basket now on uk the uk has actually played a good and positive role [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4599.92s)]
*  but it's [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4606.400000000001s)]
*  Doubly stupid to have no relations on foreign defense and climate policy with the eu [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4607.360000000001s)]
*  Given that eu nato divisions have been so bridged [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4612.64s)]
*  By the ukraine crisis the eu despite having islands in neutral, but it hasn't stopped weapons being shipped [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4616.240000000001s)]
*  There are six million ukrainian refugees in europe that have rights to to residents and to work [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4621.76s)]
*  The eu is a global trade and climate actor [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4627.9400000000005s)]
*  and so I think the first order of business is a [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4631.14s)]
*  structured serious relationship between the uk and its closest allies [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4634.26s)]
*  Geographically who are in the european union 27 of them [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4640.38s)]
*  Obviously, there's a second aspect to this which is that traditionally the uk has leveraged its relationships in the us [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4644.900000000001s)]
*  for its european [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4652.740000000001s)]
*  Engagement as well and vice versa [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4654.820000000001s)]
*  Those remain very important relationships, but as you know better than I [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4657.9400000000005s)]
*  every country in the world is hedging both on the outcome of your election and [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4662.1s)]
*  Even if the biden administration is re-elected on whether or not [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4667.62s)]
*  Your divided government is going to be able to deliver the kind of [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4671.62s)]
*  patient strategic informed [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4675.06s)]
*  Deliberative international leadership that's necessary. Yeah, and so uk is going to have to adapt what I call or [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4677.3s)]
*  Was not my phrase but the phrase of shashi tharoor the multi-aligned world [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4684.2s)]
*  Yeah, and it's a much more transactional much more fluid set of arrangements [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4688.36s)]
*  Where I think the north star just to finish third point and go back to something you said earlier [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4693.24s)]
*  The north star for our international engagement is the uk I think has to be to uphold the rule of law and to fight impunity [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4698.28s)]
*  Because that is the great danger both to our interests and to our values. Yeah. Well, uh, we'll hope that we get to see [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4703.96s)]
*  A new government in the uk committed to that. I want to just end [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4710.22s)]
*  I mean what I know that the IRC's you know, you have local partners. You have staff around the world [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4714.42s)]
*  I mean, what would you want people to know about? [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4719.9s)]
*  What your your teams are doing in places like Gaza and Sudan like what give us a window into kind of [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4722.46s)]
*  Who the people are that are on the front lines of these conflicts? Yeah [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4728.54s)]
*  I'd love people to listen to the testimony of people like our [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4732.5s)]
*  Head of our emergency health unit [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4737.08s)]
*  Seema, Jilani she did an excruciating interview in the New Yorker about her experience as a doctor in Gaza [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4739.4s)]
*  Which I really recommend that people read look the face of the IRC is now [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4746.84s)]
*  25,000 plus [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDngcTenCTs&t=4753.32s)]
