# Terrorist Threat in the United States Increasing Because of Ongoing War in Gaza
**Pod Save the World:** [June 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY)
*  Welcome to Pot Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Ben Rhodes. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1.68s)]
*  Ben, I'm in your hood. I'm in New York City. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2.56s)]
*  I'm going to be there soon. I'm going to be there next week. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4.0s)]
*  Nice. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=6.08s)]
*  Next Saturday, the annual summer pilgrimage to New York. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=6.32s)]
*  The Rhodes summer pilgrimage, the Hajj. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=8.96s)]
*  We are doing, and this is the first of about two weeks of travel and press [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=10.96s)]
*  to roll out our new book Democracy or Else. It's the first of two trips to New York. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  By the way, Democracy or Else is available June 25th, but you can pre-order it now [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=18.56s)]
*  wherever you get your books, crooket.com slash books. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=22.32s)]
*  And if you do pre-order it, it will really, really help us make the New York Times bestseller list, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=25.28s)]
*  which is a big deal. But Ben, being here, thinking about the book, talking about the book, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=29.04s)]
*  made me think about a question that I get all the time. I know you get all the time, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=33.6s)]
*  which is basically how did you get a job working for Obama? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  What's the best way for me to get involved in politics myself? That's the path. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=40.64s)]
*  And so in the book, we walk readers through like kind of all the escalating steps of political [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=45.04s)]
*  engagement from just kind of being better informed to voting, to donating, to volunteering, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=49.76s)]
*  to working on campaigns and in government. But I thought it could be fun for us just to talk about [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=54.08s)]
*  our individual paths into politics because we started at very different places, but wound up [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=58.56s)]
*  literally in the same office. And so it's kind of an interesting story of a couple [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=64.88s)]
*  options available to people. I really like that in the book because [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=69.2s)]
*  sometimes people ask me all the time, how do you get involved? What more can I do? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=73.28s)]
*  And the book provides both a mixture of stories and then advice about, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  can you get more involved, whether you want to kind of fully make it a career, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=81.28s)]
*  whether you want to just make a difference in politics in some way. For me, I always had kind [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=84.56s)]
*  of these two interests of foreign policy and politics. And actually for me, I was working [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=90.16s)]
*  at a local city council campaign in New York, a Brooklyn city council race on 9-11. And witnessing [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=94.8s)]
*  those attacks, because it was election day in New York and I was working at polling site. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=101.28s)]
*  And witnessing those attacks kind of propelled me down to Washington to look for a job in foreign [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=107.04s)]
*  policy. And I was at a think tank, Tommy, for almost six years. And so I was headed down the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=112.08s)]
*  pathway to being kind of a really a foreign policy nerd. And one of the things I noticed though, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=119.44s)]
*  is that it didn't matter what papers you wrote at the think tank, if George W. Bush was president, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=126.08s)]
*  things weren't going to change. So I wanted to get involved in politics. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  And I kind of entered through the doorway of like the hundreds of foreign policy advisors [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=135.28s)]
*  to a presidential campaign who were often largely ignored by the presidential campaign, let's face it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=139.6s)]
*  But I just kind of kept working. I started offering to do stuff for free essentially. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=145.04s)]
*  I got some small writing assignments. I remember I wrote an op-ed for Obama for some Irish newspaper [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=150.32s)]
*  that was like, call me Obama with an apostrophe or something. And I somehow got to Favreau that way, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=156.48s)]
*  because they're like, oh, this guy can actually write. And so I kind of wrote my way into the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  Obama campaign, volunteering though, in my free time. And ultimately got hired to be a speechwriter [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=168.32s)]
*  with the kind of foreign policy focus and then patching holes in the foreign policy comms team [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=177.12s)]
*  on things like debate prep and responding to whatever crazy thing our opponents said. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=182.16s)]
*  So I kind of came into a foreign policy think tank door that became increasingly political, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=187.2s)]
*  because I was like, well, if you want to change foreign policy, you got to get involved in politics. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=193.2s)]
*  Yeah, no, I mean, the opposite path. I mean, I graduated college in 2002 and I moved to DC [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=196.95999999999998s)]
*  to intern for Senator Ted Kennedy and start applying for jobs in Washington. But my timing [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=201.28s)]
*  was awful. I plopped down into the beating heart of that Bush era, post 9-11 hysteria and the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=206.48s)]
*  politics of fear. And we had the run up to the Iraq War and the creation of the Department of [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=212.88s)]
*  Homeland Security. And then Democrats just got crushed in the 2002 midterms, crushed. So there [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=216.64s)]
*  are quite literally fewer jobs. And so I got a short stint doing field on a campaign on a Senate [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=222.4s)]
*  race in North Carolina. We got destroyed. And then I was sort of literally just like interning, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=227.76000000000002s)]
*  living on my buddy's couch, eating ramen noodles, feeling very sad and sorry for myself when I [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=234.4s)]
*  finally got a job hired to work on John Edwards 2004 presidential campaign. Basically, I'd gotten [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=239.12s)]
*  it down to two options, Ben. I was going to work for Edwards, where I was going to go work at Club [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=244.32s)]
*  Med and be something called a GEO, which I think is when you push kids in the pool and get way too [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=247.84s)]
*  tan. So luckily I got the Edwards job. I was literally like the lowest person on the team. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=255.52s)]
*  I fetched a lot of lunches, but I learned by osmosis. I got sent on the campaign trail. I [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=262.0s)]
*  went to Iowa, New Hampshire. And in the book, we wrote about some of the craziest stories [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=265.68s)]
*  from those days. But even though Edwards got crushed by John Kerry, I met some people who [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=270.56s)]
*  then worked for Obama on that Senate race. Shout out Pichi and Greco and David Axelrod. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=277.44s)]
*  And I harassed them once a week until they hired me, spent a couple of years in the Senate, went [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=282.32s)]
*  to Iowa, the Chicago headquarters, where I met you on the general election in 2008. And then finally, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=286.96s)]
*  four years in the White House. So it was really like the key for me was learning by osmosis, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  gaining the trust of President Obama, the first lady, the senior staff there, and then just [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=297.28s)]
*  you know, working my ass off to prove that I could do it and then I could learn enough to actually [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=301.76s)]
*  survive in that job, which you know, we did okay for four years, we weren't perfect. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=307.12s)]
*  Well, the funny thing is the shorthand for both of us and you're right, I joke about this, right, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=311.03999999999996s)]
*  like the kind of right wing trolls is I got a fiction writing MFA when I was 22 and 23. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=314.32s)]
*  And you drove a van. Yeah, I drove a press van for a month. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=320.8s)]
*  And so it's like van driver fiction writer. I would actually argue though, particularly actually, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=325.52s)]
*  I'm going to come to the defense of van drivers. The point is do everything, do whatever it takes. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=330.64s)]
*  And if you're getting into politics, drive the fucking van. Like, like, do the press clips. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=335.91999999999996s)]
*  I did press clips on my first campaign I worked on. Like, actually, those are not only is that [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=341.52s)]
*  good experience, but it also you got to show you're like, to get into the NBA here, you're [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=347.03999999999996s)]
*  like Drew Holiday on the Celtics or Josh Hart on the Knicks, you know, you're gonna get the loose [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=353.28s)]
*  balls before you start draining the threes. And even the fiction writing, right? I mean, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=356.32s)]
*  writing was a good skill. Like, actually, the way I got hired is I was a good writer. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=360.88s)]
*  There were hundreds of other foreign policy advisors who, you know, had comparable foreign [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=365.44s)]
*  policy experience a few years at a think tank. So, you know, I actually had to push back at the trolls. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=369.44s)]
*  Like, that willingness to try everything and to get a skill and to meet people, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=376.4s)]
*  that's how you get in politics. It's not just, you know, sitting there and waiting to be [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=380.48s)]
*  plucked off your couch. Yeah, it's funny. People, people attack you for having a diverse [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=384.56s)]
*  set of interests and me for working my way up, I guess. But anyway, it's kind of a weird thing [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=389.04s)]
*  if you actually take a step back and think about it. Yeah. But also, like most fun I've ever had [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=393.92s)]
*  in my life, met some of my best friends to this day. And so anybody who says, how do I get involved [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=397.52s)]
*  in politics? I say, go work on a campaign. But anyway, there's lots of great advice, lots of fun [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=402.88s)]
*  stories. There was a time I was in a van that hit a moose in New Hampshire that ended very poorly [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=407.12s)]
*  for the moose and almost for me. So if you want to learn more, preorder now at crooket.com. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=412.64s)]
*  And the profits from democracy or else are going to vote save America and progressive candidates [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=417.44s)]
*  and causes in 2024. So you're doing a lot of good. Ben, we got a great show today. So we're [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=422.56s)]
*  going to talk about last weekend's peace summit in Switzerland that focused on ending the war in [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=427.76s)]
*  Ukraine and see what if any progress is made. We'll explain why Russian President Vladimir Putin [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=432.4s)]
*  is going to North Korea is in North Korea right now, actually, and what a deeper partnership [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=437.28s)]
*  between those two countries would mean for the world. We'll cover the latest in the case of an [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=441.12s)]
*  American journalist being held hostage in Russia, as well as news from Israel and Gaza, why French [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=444.8s)]
*  President Emmanuel Macron's decision to call snap elections in a few weeks is looking like it might [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=449.68s)]
*  be catastrophic for him for his political future and why experts are sounding the alarm about [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=454.32s)]
*  the proliferation of nuclear weapons. I will also cover protests in Argentina. And finally, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=459.68s)]
*  we'll find out if the Pope is funny, Ben. Everyone is wondering if the Pope is funny, maybe a tight [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=464.32s)]
*  five on the Reformation or something like that. And then you just talked with Congresswoman [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=468.96s)]
*  Ilhan Omar. What did you guys discuss? Yeah. So I've talked to Ilhan Omar about [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=472.47999999999996s)]
*  a letter that she's sending to the administration. She's got at least a couple dozen other members [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=477.52s)]
*  of Congress on it that she's actually releasing around her pod save the world appearance, Tommy, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=482.24s)]
*  that calls for humanitarian parole for Sudanese who've been displaced and [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=488.0s)]
*  obviously impacted by the horrific civil war there. So this is something that a program that [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=493.03999999999996s)]
*  we have for Ukrainians and Afghans, so people from those war zones to have the capacity to come [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=497.44s)]
*  find asylum and safety and security in the United States. So we talk about that effort. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=505.28s)]
*  We talk about the war in Sudan more broadly and what other steps the U.S. can take [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=511.36s)]
*  to try to address the underlying causes and provide humanitarian support and hopefully [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=515.68s)]
*  pursue a political resolution there. We frankly then bring in Gaza because a common thread between [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=520.08s)]
*  Sudan and Gaza is that U.S. weapons are being used in both of those wars. And some of the politics [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=525.68s)]
*  around AIPAC getting involved in Democratic primaries coming up on the horizon, then [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=531.92s)]
*  Jamal Bowman's primary in New York. So it's a good interview. And at the end, I think she speaks [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=537.76s)]
*  powerfully about in a time of rising xenophobia and anti-immigrant, anti-refugee sentiment, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=543.28s)]
*  how do you kind of push back on that as well? That's excellent. Well, I'm glad you had the [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=548.88s)]
*  conversation. I'm glad she's doing that. Well, all right, Ben, let's turn to our first story today, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=552.16s)]
*  which is this past weekend, representatives from over 90 countries participated in a peace summit [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=557.4399999999999s)]
*  in Switzerland focused on the war in Ukraine. It was an initiative led by Ukrainian President [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=562.88s)]
*  Volodymyr Zelensky, who is trying to recruit international support for his own larger peace [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=567.76s)]
*  plan. Zelensky's long-term goal is to recruit other countries as intermediaries to put pressure on [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=572.48s)]
*  Russia and to build support for the Ukrainian side. Here's a clip from Zelensky's remarks at this event. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=577.76s)]
*  Now there is no Russia here. Why? Because if Russia was interested in peace, there would be no war. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=583.84s)]
*  We must decide together what a just peace means for the world and how it can be achieved in a [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=594.24s)]
*  truly lasting way. The UN Charter is the basis for us. And then when the action plan is on the table, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=600.88s)]
*  agreed by all and transparent for the peoples, then it will be communicated to the representatives [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=608.72s)]
*  of Russia. So Ben, the good news for Zelensky is he got 82 countries to sign off on three parts of [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=617.92s)]
*  his 10-point peace plan. Those elements focus on nuclear security, nuclear safety, I should say, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=624.0s)]
*  food security and returning POWs or children who were kidnapped and taken to Russia. Vice President [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=629.92s)]
*  Kamala Harris represented for the United States. Jake Sullivan, the national security advisor, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=635.1999999999999s)]
*  was there as well. They announced another 1.5 billion in US assistance. The bad news for Zelensky [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=639.12s)]
*  is that Russia and China didn't attend. And several big countries, including India, Saudi Arabia, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=644.8s)]
*  South Africa, and Mexico, did not sign off on the summit's final communique. So shortly before the [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=650.24s)]
*  summit, Ben Vladimir Putin laid out his own ceasefire deal such as it was. It would require [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=655.84s)]
*  Ukraine to pull its forces out of the four regions Russia had invaded in 2022, drop its bid to join [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=661.12s)]
*  NATO and would require the West to drop all sanctions preemptively. The best response to [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=667.2s)]
*  Putin's proposal was from Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Maloney, who said, quote, it doesn't seem [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=672.4s)]
*  particularly effective to me as a negotiation proposal to tell Ukraine that it must withdraw [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=677.0400000000001s)]
*  from Ukraine. Well said. So Ben, I bet there's some listeners who are thinking like, what the [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=681.2s)]
*  hell is the point of a peace summit if Russia isn't even at the table? How would you sell the [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=686.1600000000001s)]
*  value of this event to them? So I have a piece I mentioned that came out in Foreign Affairs today. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=691.2800000000001s)]
*  I referenced this in the past in a very nerdy way. But I have a piece out in Foreign Affairs today [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=697.76s)]
*  called the Foreign Policy for the World as it is. Check it out online. I think it's actually out [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=702.6400000000001s)]
*  from behind the paywall too, so you don't have to deal with that. But I mention it because actually [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=707.2s)]
*  the basic premise of the piece is if you step back and look at American foreign policy and it's about [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=711.6800000000001s)]
*  kind of what should hopefully in a second Biden term the US approach be, if you step back and look [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=715.84s)]
*  at it, the quote unquote rules-based international order doesn't really exist anymore. So the system [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=721.2800000000001s)]
*  that you use to resolve disputes like this, now you have a kind of US-led group of countries. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=725.9200000000001s)]
*  You've got the Russians trying to tear everything down. You've got the Chinese building their own [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=731.6s)]
*  parallel order. And you have countries like the ones you mentioned, like South Africa, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=735.12s)]
*  they kind of float in between these different blocks. I mention that because in that kind of [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=739.2s)]
*  world what you have to do is you can't just go to the UN and have a peace conference like you might [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=744.0s)]
*  have done 15 years ago because the Russians aren't going to play ball. There are too many [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=748.4s)]
*  disagreements on the Security Council. And so you have to start with the kind of like-minded [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=752.64s)]
*  countries. How many countries can we get to kind of sign on with our position on an issue? And that's [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=757.36s)]
*  what the Ukrainians are doing at the peace summit so that you demonstrate the support for your [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=762.88s)]
*  position. I obviously support Zelensky's core point, which is Ukraine sovereignty should be [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=768.24s)]
*  respected. And then you kind of test how many countries can you bring on to that position. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=772.96s)]
*  And I think that's what was happening at this peace summit. It was like, can we demonstrate [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=778.96s)]
*  long-term support, including financing for Ukraine? Can we demonstrate support for what will be [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=782.8s)]
*  Ukrainian positions at the negotiating table? But then the second and more difficult challenge is, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=787.28s)]
*  that's all well and good, but that agreement doesn't end the war and that doesn't get Russia [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=793.3599999999999s)]
*  out of parts of Ukraine. And so you have to use that platform of what was agreed at that peace [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=797.1999999999999s)]
*  summit and what the Ukrainian plan is as a foundation for then negotiating between these [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=802.7199999999999s)]
*  different blocks. And that means you're going to have to negotiate with Russia. And what we saw [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=807.68s)]
*  from Putin is, that's Putin's starting negotiating position, which is essentially we get to keep all [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=812.16s)]
*  the parts of Ukraine, everything we want, that we want annex, which are more than even what [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=816.88s)]
*  Russia currently occupies in Ukraine. And so the utility of the last week is essentially, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=822.24s)]
*  we have Russia's opening offer and Ukraine's opening offer. And nobody's going to like it, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=827.84s)]
*  but what's going to be necessary going forward is a negotiation between those two positions where, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=832.64s)]
*  let's face it, Ukraine's probably not going to get everything that they want. But if they can [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=838.32s)]
*  maintain a lot of international support, they should be able to get a lot more than what [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=842.4s)]
*  Russia's currently offering. We won't really know how that negotiation goes until after the US [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=846.0s)]
*  election, because the Russians are going to wait to see if they get Trump. If Biden is reelected, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=850.72s)]
*  then I think you probably get pretty soon into a real negotiation that seeks to determine, okay, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=855.12s)]
*  how much territory can Ukraine get back? How much can they be able to choose? Do they want [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=860.96s)]
*  to join the European Union? What's their relationship with NATO? That's where this [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=866.08s)]
*  will all get more difficult. Yeah. And for what it's worth, Zelensky said that Putin's kind of [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=869.52s)]
*  ridiculous opening bid of just keeping four districts of Ukraine, I think, he said helped [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=873.92s)]
*  build support among other countries at the conference because it was like just laughable [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=880.56s)]
*  on its face. But that same strategy was just employed at the G7 where the UK, the US, Canada, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=884.4799999999999s)]
*  France, Germany, Italy, Japan came together and announced a $50 billion loan to Ukraine to buy [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=890.8s)]
*  more weapons and to repair damaged infrastructure. That money will be fronted by the US and other [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=895.68s)]
*  Western countries, but paid off by profits from $300 billion in frozen Russian assets. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=901.28s)]
*  Biden and Zelensky also signed a 10-year security agreement between the US and Ukraine. But [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=907.28s)]
*  unfortunately, that agreement is meaningless if Donald Trump gets elected, like you said. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=912.56s)]
*  And here's a clip of what Trump recently had to say about Zelensky. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=917.4399999999999s)]
*  I think Zelensky is maybe the greatest salesman of any politician that's ever lived. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=921.92s)]
*  Every time he comes to our country, he walks away with $60 billion. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=928.16s)]
*  And I like him, you know, on the impeachment hoax number one, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=935.28s)]
*  he was very good. He said, no, the president didn't threaten me at all. He could have been [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=939.52s)]
*  a grandstander and said, I was threatened, right, Matt? He could have said I was threatened. So I [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=944.48s)]
*  like him. But he's a greatest salesman of all time. He walks in. So now here's the beauty. He just left [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=949.12s)]
*  four days ago with $60 billion. And he gets home and he announces that he needs another $60 billion. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=956.96s)]
*  I said, never ends. It never ends. I will have that settled prior to taking the White House [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=965.44s)]
*  as president-elect. I will have that settled. Got to stop it. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=974.48s)]
*  Sort of a weird, muddled message there. But you know, I think the obvious takeaway is that if [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=980.5600000000001s)]
*  Trump wins, he will say to Zelensky, you're giving up territory. Stop talking about Crimea. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=985.04s)]
*  You're not getting any more money. You're not in NATO. Ball game. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=989.52s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, a lot going on there as usual. I don't know who Matt is. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=993.68s)]
*  I think Matt Schlapp. Was that like CPAC or something? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=997.68s)]
*  I don't know. But it's, you know, on the one hand, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1000.16s)]
*  look, as long as he's not a salesman, he's trying to save his country. And, you know, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1007.12s)]
*  he's not like walking away with like money from a candy store. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1010.64s)]
*  Yeah. This is like money for their survival. And it's never, obviously never enough when you're [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1014.8s)]
*  facing an existential threat. I do want to say, and again, I make this point in this article I [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1020.8s)]
*  mentioned, we have to take Trump's populism more seriously, though. I think sometimes people in [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1025.36s)]
*  foreign policy are like, they turn up their nose and say, well, you know, he doesn't understand [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1029.76s)]
*  the complexity and or he's just a Putin stooge. And those things are true, by the way. But [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1034.16s)]
*  that point he made is like a valid one. Right. How long and how much money does Ukraine need? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1040.3200000000002s)]
*  And what's the plan for this to end? We can't just presume that people will default, want to [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1045.68s)]
*  continue to give 50, 60, 70 billion dollar packages to Ukraine every year. I do think part of what the [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1051.76s)]
*  administration has been trying to do at the G7 too, is it right now it feels like time is working for [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1058.0800000000002s)]
*  Putin. Right. So Russia's bigger. They have more men that they can script and throw at the front [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1062.96s)]
*  line. They've been able to rebuild the military industrial complex. And it looks like time is [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1067.28s)]
*  working for Putin. And all this additional money, this 50 billion dollar loan, this 10 year agreement [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1071.44s)]
*  is meant to signal no, no, no, there are people that are in Ukraine's corner for the long haul. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1077.28s)]
*  The resources are going to be there. We're getting creative. And this is, by the way, one way to [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1081.36s)]
*  address the populist concern. The 50 billion is not U.S. taxpayer. It's going to ultimately be paid [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1085.44s)]
*  back by the credit from Russian assets that are frozen. But at the end of the day, the problem with [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1091.12s)]
*  that is that, as you said, it's not really a long term plan if Trump wins. It's a political messaging [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1100.2399999999998s)]
*  thing today that if Biden wins, yes, then it indicates a long term 10 year commitment that [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1109.12s)]
*  will be continued. But again, I think the common thread between these two things is you're going [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1113.6799999999998s)]
*  to have to bring in diplomacy and negotiation more. I mean, frankly, one way to sustain American [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1119.28s)]
*  public support is to show that you're willing to test diplomacy too, and that you're willing [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1123.68s)]
*  to explore negotiation with Russia, with the Ukrainians along the way here. Just saying we're [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1128.6399999999999s)]
*  going to continue arming them indefinitely in the current status quo, where there's a kind of front [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1134.8s)]
*  line that is creeping in the wrong direction. No, it's not going to. Watch any focus group of [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1139.76s)]
*  swing voters. They're not excited about shoveling 60 billion a year over to Ukraine. But to your [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1143.6s)]
*  point, Ben, while Putin didn't make it to Switzerland, he did have time for a two day [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1148.56s)]
*  trip to North Korea this week. This is Putin's second meeting with Kim Jong Un in nine months. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1152.3999999999999s)]
*  The last one was in Eastern Russia when Putin took Kim Jong Un on a tour of some highly sensitive [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1156.8s)]
*  military and space technology sites. Your kind of classic soft power cultural tourism visit. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1162.56s)]
*  Putin's last visit to North Korea itself was back in 2000. Since the full scale invasion of Ukraine [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1168.3999999999999s)]
*  in 2022, North Korea has transferred over millions of shells, missiles, other weapons to Russia. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1172.96s)]
*  The South Korean defense minister told Bloomberg News that he believes North Korea has exported [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1179.52s)]
*  five million rounds of ammunition. In exchange, Putin has said publicly that Russia can assist [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1183.6000000000001s)]
*  North Korea with satellite launches and other associated technology. That technology would be [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1188.16s)]
*  very helpful with North Korea's ballistic missile program, by the way. The Times, New York Times [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1193.28s)]
*  says Russia has also sent economic aid to North Korea and North Korean hackers are using Russian [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1197.8400000000001s)]
*  cryptocurrency exchanges to launder money. So Ben, you were you were blown up the potty of [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1202.32s)]
*  the world group chat about seven a.m. Monday morning about this story because you're concerned. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1206.56s)]
*  Well, what has he worked up about this this Putin, Kim Jong Un bromance? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1210.08s)]
*  I think it's a bigger deal than people. You know, this is not normal for Putin to go to, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1214.96s)]
*  as you said, he hasn't gone since 2000. And I think it speaks to several things that are alarming. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1219.6799999999998s)]
*  Right. One is my point before about how there's no international order. Like Russia is just [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1224.32s)]
*  flagrantly violating U.N. sanctions that it itself voted for. Right. U.N. Security Council. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1228.64s)]
*  Right. So they're not supposed to be giving any arms to the North Koreans. They're not supposed [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1234.5600000000002s)]
*  to be giving like luxury goods. And we and some of the reporting Kim Jong Un is riding around in [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1239.1200000000001s)]
*  a Russian limousine like that. So it says something about how fractured the system is that Russia is [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1244.64s)]
*  just out in the open violating its own agreements. It's like these things don't matter anymore. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1250.48s)]
*  Then underneath that, I worry about, again, what is North Korea getting? They're clearly getting [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1255.4399999999998s)]
*  military technology. You know, Kim had visited like a space center in Russia during his visit, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1260.24s)]
*  anything that helps them with their ballistic missile program, that helps them kind of [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1266.32s)]
*  fortify their own military, their fuel needs, things like that. I worry about North Korea [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1270.08s)]
*  being in a position where it feels emboldened to start to lash out and engage in provocations [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1275.52s)]
*  at South Korea. Not necessarily invading South Korea, but imagine if Trump's elected and the North [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1282.0s)]
*  Koreans are like, well, we got Russian technology. We got Kim Jong Un's best friend Donald Trump in [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1287.04s)]
*  the White House. That may be the time that they start to, I don't know, let's sink a South Korean [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1291.44s)]
*  ship or let's shell a South Korean island. And I worry that the Korean peninsula could suddenly [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1296.32s)]
*  become a hotspot again. And then also I wouldn't sell short the value to Russia of all these North [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1300.56s)]
*  Korean armaments they're getting because North Korea had basically prepared for decades to fight [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1306.48s)]
*  kind of an artillery war, among other things, on a frontline between North and South Korea. So they [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1311.44s)]
*  have a lot of stuff that is clearly helping to make the Russians whole. So all in all, this is, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1315.84s)]
*  you know, there'll be funny pictures and, you know, we can surmise how awkward the small talk is [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1320.8s)]
*  between Putin and Kim Jong Un, some generational differences there, some probably differences in [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1326.16s)]
*  how they like to hang. But the reality is, it's a huge challenge to South Korea, to the United States, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1331.68s)]
*  to Ukraine, and to the international order that it seems to have unraveled here. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1337.3600000000001s)]
*  Yes, agreed. And one last story coming out of Russia. We wanted to update you guys on the [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1341.68s)]
*  detention of Wall Street Journal reporter, Evan Gershkovich, who has been held hostage in Russia [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1345.8400000000001s)]
*  for about 15 months now. A Russian court announced that Evan will stand trial on charges of espionage. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1350.0s)]
*  The trial begins on June 26. It's going to happen behind closed doors at a venue, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1355.68s)]
*  I think more than 1100 miles east of Moscow. And if convicted, Evan could face up to 20 years in [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1360.0s)]
*  prison. So for about 15 months, Russia didn't even pretend to offer evidence of Evan's guilt. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1365.52s)]
*  Now prosecutors say the FSB has evidence that he was acting on CIA instructions to collect secret [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1371.28s)]
*  information about a Russian tank factory that is self-evidently bullshit. We spoke with Anton [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1376.48s)]
*  Troyanovsky. He's the Moscow bureau chief for the New York Times, who is currently based in Berlin [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1381.76s)]
*  and a good friend of Evan's who spent years getting to know him when they were both reporting [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1386.24s)]
*  in Russia. Here's what he had to say about how Evan is doing through all this. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1389.52s)]
*  Evan is very much staying strong. I think the most important thing is for him to [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1393.36s)]
*  remain a part of life outside the prison walls. So, you know, he's so interested in [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1402.48s)]
*  just like daily life. What are his friends up to? What was our mutual friend's 30th birthday party [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1412.48s)]
*  like recently? Cummings and goings, where are people moving? Who's getting together with whom? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1420.96s)]
*  So that's the kind of stuff that Evan is interested in and, you know, just daily life stuff. And [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1426.88s)]
*  and for him to be aware of that is really important because it also, you know, I think it's just so [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1434.24s)]
*  important to make sure that Evan knows we're all still thinking of him and he does very much remain [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1443.1200000000001s)]
*  a part of our lives. So then, you know, over the last 15 months or so, there's been lots of talk [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1450.64s)]
*  about a potential prisoner swap for Evan because this is obviously just a fake case. Russia has [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1456.5600000000002s)]
*  suggested that a swap could only happen after a verdict in the case has happened. So I guess the [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1461.92s)]
*  question is whether, okay, is Russia proceeding with this prosecution? Bad news because it means [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1467.04s)]
*  they're just going to forge ahead with a sham trial or could it be good news because moving the [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1473.6000000000001s)]
*  case forward, getting a verdict is a prerequisite for Russia, then releasing Evan in a prisoner [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1478.5600000000002s)]
*  swap. Do you have a view on that? I think that, I mean, first of all, the clip reminds you that [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1484.16s)]
*  there's a human being here and it's not just like a name and a piece on the chessboard. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1488.32s)]
*  Look, I think that usually Russia goes through the process like with Brittany Greiner, you know, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1495.36s)]
*  they had to kind of go through the process to legitimize why they detain this person. So I do [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1499.9199999999998s)]
*  think it's not necessarily bad news because they kind of feel the need to prove that their version [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1504.48s)]
*  of events is somehow validated by their judicial system. I do worry about just the, you know, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1510.96s)]
*  it's election season, Putin's rooting for Trump. Trump's out there saying like essentially don't [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1516.96s)]
*  release Evan or like I'll deal with this when I get in, you know? So let me read you his truth. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1522.56s)]
*  This is from a truth social post from May 23rd. He said Evan will be released almost immediately [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1526.96s)]
*  after the election. He said Evan will quote, will be home safe and with his family, Vladimir Putin, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1532.08s)]
*  the president of Russia will do that for me, but not for anyone else. And we will be paying nothing. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1536.32s)]
*  So to your point, nowhere in there did he offer to, I don't know, help out now, get Evan out, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1540.8s)]
*  regardless of wins the election. Yeah. And the wink wink to Putin is that for no one else will [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1545.52s)]
*  they do that, i.e. Joe Biden, right? And so, you know, Trump is literally making it harder, I think, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1549.28s)]
*  to get an American home for all the, you know, bloviating that Trump does about trying to get [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1553.84s)]
*  hostages out. And so I do worry that this kind of period up to the election, it's unlikely to see [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1559.12s)]
*  something happen because, you know, Putin has every incentive to just wait this out and Trump is [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1565.36s)]
*  giving him that incentive. He certainly is. One last quick Trump thing, just an aside, Ben. Last [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1570.4s)]
*  week, we made a huge mistake on our show and we forgot to update listeners on Jared Kushner's [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1574.16s)]
*  planned real estate deal in Serbia. We talked about it a few months back, some like half a billion [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1579.92s)]
*  dollar real estate deal he's trying to negotiate with the government. We mentioned this to friends [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1584.3200000000002s)]
*  of the pod subscribers, but not everyone. According to a report in Spy Talk magazine, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1588.0800000000002s)]
*  this real estate deal includes a commitment by Jared Kushner to construct a quote, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1592.24s)]
*  memorial dedicated to all the victims of NATO aggression. This is referencing the [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1596.64s)]
*  US led bombing campaign against Slobodan Milosevic, a man who was charged with genocide, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1601.36s)]
*  war crimes and crimes against humanity. So that's what Jared's up to. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1606.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And look, the reality is, you know, if Barack Obama like visited Vietnam to do work, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1609.9199999999998s)]
*  they'd be like, he's on an apology tour, right? Jared Kushner is literally trying to profit off [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1615.76s)]
*  of the construction of memorials against NATO aggression. Literally, he's creating monuments [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1620.56s)]
*  against like the United States and its foreign policy in the past. This is kind of the apology [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1627.04s)]
*  tour taken to an extreme of like a real estate apology tour. If it benefits Jared Kushner's [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1633.04s)]
*  wallet and bottom line, like there's no line that this guy won't cross. And I think it's a sign that [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1640.16s)]
*  smaller country that doesn't get as much attention, but given all the business that's happening with [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1645.92s)]
*  the pro-Russian Serbian government, I wouldn't shock me to see that part of [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1650.64s)]
*  Europe deteriorate a little bit if you get Jared and his buddy Rick Rennell back in charge of [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1657.5200000000002s)]
*  things. Yeah, Rick Rennell, who the New York Times reported is looking to explore ammunition [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1663.1200000000001s)]
*  manufacturing opportunities in the Balkans, which is just, I don't know, the most corrupt [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1667.0400000000002s)]
*  sound anything I've ever heard. But anyway, that's why we can't let those guys win. But we digress, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1671.2800000000002s)]
*  Ben. So let's turn to Gaza because I look, I don't know what to say week after week is just [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1676.5600000000002s)]
*  getting steadily worse. Last week, we talked about how Benny Gantz, a relatively moderate political [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1680.0s)]
*  figure, former general, decided to withdraw from Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu's war cabinet, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1685.68s)]
*  along with another former top military leader. On Sunday, Netanyahu disbanded the war cabinet [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1690.48s)]
*  altogether. It seems pretty clear he did so to avoid having to include a far right extremist [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1695.84s)]
*  members of his coalition government in this war cabinet, guys like the national security minister, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1701.28s)]
*  Itamar Ben-Gavir, who had demanded he be included in these in these negotiations. But regardless of [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1705.2s)]
*  Netanyahu's motivation, the net results looks like it's just going to concentrate more power in his [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1710.48s)]
*  hands and Bibi's hands. That has not stopped Netanyahu, though, from blaming others for how [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1715.76s)]
*  things are going. On Sunday, the Israeli military announced it would pause fighting during the [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1719.8400000000001s)]
*  daytime in some parts of southern Gaza in an effort to facilitate the entry and distribution [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1724.56s)]
*  of more aid into the Gaza Strip. This was like a pretty limited step, basically a pride to like [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1728.96s)]
*  seven miles worth of road that is critical for getting aid in and out. But relief organizations [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1733.52s)]
*  were hopeful that it would help them not only get aid in, but also distribute it without getting [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1738.32s)]
*  hit with airstrikes. Unfortunately, that hope was pretty quickly dashed when the Israeli government [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1742.8s)]
*  leaked that Netanyahu had learned about this daytime pause plan in the press that he wasn't [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1748.0s)]
*  happy about it. And so it seems like it's sort of partially walked back. A lot of people think [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1753.28s)]
*  Netanyahu is lying and just kind of talking out of both sides of his mouth here, but who knows. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1757.28s)]
*  Meanwhile, Ben, Israel and Hamas don't seem to be any closer on the ceasefire agreement that [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1762.32s)]
*  has been proposed. Tensions keep ratcheting up between Israel and Hezbollah. According to the AP, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1767.36s)]
*  Israel says it has targeted 4,500 Hezbollah sites in the past five months. The IDF has taken out [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1772.32s)]
*  several senior Hezbollah leaders in recent weeks, and more than 60,000 Israelis have had to evacuate [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1777.52s)]
*  from northern Israel because of this cross-border fighting. So the status quo is just awful. Ben, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1782.56s)]
*  do you get the sense that Netanyahu's political position has improved after Gantz's departure [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1788.08s)]
*  from the war cabinet, or is it just status quo? Is it worse? What's your take? [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1792.8s)]
*  Well, I think you have to keep in mind that Netanyahu's play is always to try to divide [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1796.6399999999999s)]
*  his opposition and cling to power with his relatively small base of support in Israel. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1800.56s)]
*  Even long before October 7th, we consistently saw him bring centrists into some kind of cabinet. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1805.9199999999998s)]
*  This happened with Yair Lapid. This happened with Zippy Livni. This happened with Ehud Barak. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1811.9199999999998s)]
*  Those people always leave the cabinet less popular than they came in. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1816.96s)]
*  Here, I think the alarming thing is that Gantz is leaving, the war cabinet is dissolving. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1821.76s)]
*  And so Netanyahu is just, when he's in small rooms making decisions, he's more likely to be in even [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1829.28s)]
*  smaller rooms, just him and a couple of people like Ron Dermer, his close aide. Or he's going [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1835.1999999999998s)]
*  to have to listen to these far-right people who always had, let's face it, the sway in his [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1840.96s)]
*  government. I mean, people listening should know Benny Gantz was not a part of the coalition that [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1844.64s)]
*  is the governing coalition in Israel. So his withdrawal doesn't kind of collapse the government [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1849.44s)]
*  in any way. Netanyahu has always been beholden to stay in power to those far-right guys. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1854.16s)]
*  So in some ways, I don't think things really change substantively that much. The Israeli [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1860.24s)]
*  government is what it is. But you're right, he's now going to be even more beholden or kind of more [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1864.8000000000002s)]
*  likely to only listen to those voices to his far-right. He's kind of weathered the backlash to his [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1870.96s)]
*  leadership after October 7th. And he's clearly trying to drag this thing out. This is the open-ended [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1877.3600000000001s)]
*  war that we were all afraid of. And just a couple of other things on the points you mentioned, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1883.3600000000001s)]
*  we saw with the ceasefire, for instance, we talked about this last week. Sure, Hamas absolutely is [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1888.8s)]
*  not playing ball. They're not agreeing to the terms the US is presenting because they want an [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1895.3600000000001s)]
*  Israeli agreement to end the war up front. But it's also been the case that Netanyahu has never [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1898.8s)]
*  been able to endorse what the administration said was an Israeli proposal. The aid thing reminds me [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1902.96s)]
*  of that because Netanyahu is unable to stand up and say that aid should get into Gaza. He has to [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1909.28s)]
*  act like either he was surprised or he's acting like he's surprised. This is not leadership. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1914.8s)]
*  If you can't stand up, and it can't be the US standing up and saying, Israel's doing this, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1920.56s)]
*  Israel's letting aid in. Why can't the Israeli prime minister be able to stand up in front of [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1924.8s)]
*  his own people and say, we support the ceasefire deal or we think aid should get in? It's indicative [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1929.04s)]
*  of a political leadership that is not really committed to doing the right thing or the thing [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1934.3999999999999s)]
*  that the US wants it to do in all these spaces. And that brings in his blood because, look, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1938.8s)]
*  we can talk about the back and forth on the border. It's a political problem for Netanyahu, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1944.08s)]
*  that tens and tens of thousands of Israelis have been displaced for this whole time. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1948.1599999999999s)]
*  But the reality is until you have a ceasefire in Gaza, you're going to have this kind of [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1951.6s)]
*  liberal conflict that could escalate in Lebanon. We haven't even talked about the fact that [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1955.36s)]
*  there's basically been an ongoing naval battle between the United States and the Houthis [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1959.52s)]
*  and the Red Sea. So long as the war in Gaza continues, the Red Sea, Lebanon are going to [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1963.76s)]
*  continue to be sources of violence and potential escalation. Yeah. I mean, on the Houthi point, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1969.36s)]
*  there was a story in maybe the Wall Street Journal the other day about a commercial ship [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1974.24s)]
*  in the Red Sea that had been attacked by basically a Houthi sea drone. Essentially, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1978.56s)]
*  what the Ukrainians are using is the Russian fleet. And then they got hit with the Houthi [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1982.0s)]
*  missiles. These guys had to just sort of sit there and think they were going to die for 10 hours [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1985.76s)]
*  before being rescued by the US Navy. But I think one person is still missing and presumed dead. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1989.52s)]
*  But then more broadly, I mean, I think listeners probably, like anyone who's listened to the show [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1994.0s)]
*  knows that we both think this war is a humanitarian disaster. We've been critical of Biden's refusal [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=1997.12s)]
*  to put any sort of real pressure on Netanyahu. We think the only path forward is both sides agreeing [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2002.24s)]
*  to a hostage release deal and a ceasefire deal that ends the war that gets to a permanent [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2006.56s)]
*  cessation of hostilities. And this Israeli stated goal of quote unquote eradicating Hamas is just [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2011.12s)]
*  not achievable. It's not realistic. But I do want to give folks just another reason why I think the [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2016.56s)]
*  war needs to end, which is we are hearing more and more top intelligence officials say that the war [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2022.3999999999999s)]
*  in Gaza is drastically increasing the risk of a terrorist attack on the United States. There was [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2028.6399999999999s)]
*  a piece in Foreign Affairs by an academic named Graham Allison and then the former Deputy CIA [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2034.16s)]
*  Director Michael Morell. The headline was the terrorism warning lights are blinking red again. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2039.1200000000001s)]
*  And this is not based on like classified sources. These people aren't in government anywhere. They're [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2044.3200000000002s)]
*  talking about testimony from senior national figures like the FBI Director Christopher Ray or [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2047.8400000000001s)]
*  the head of CENTCOM who said Christopher Ray said after October 7th, quote, we've seen the threat [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2054.4s)]
*  from foreign terrorists rise to a whole nother level. Ray is particularly concerned about [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2059.68s)]
*  terrorists or ISIS linked people getting into the US through the southern border. The US recently [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2064.72s)]
*  arrested eight Tajik nationals believed to have connections with ISIS. We don't know if that is [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2069.12s)]
*  true, but these guys entered through the southern border. They requested asylum. And then according [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2073.12s)]
*  to good analysis of ISIS-K by CNN, this is an organization that is primarily run by Tajiks. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2077.9199999999996s)]
*  They basically try to radicalize and inspire attackers sort of out in the world. They're not [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2087.28s)]
*  trying to train and recruit people, like teach them how to fly a plane like 9-11. They're trying to [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2092.64s)]
*  say, get to the US, radicalize you there, buy a gun off the shelf, you know, anywhere in this country, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2096.48s)]
*  you'll go to a Walmart, get an AR-15 and do something horrific. So I just think the full [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2102.64s)]
*  takeaway is the war in Gaza is putting American lives at risk in the United States, full stop. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2107.12s)]
*  No one's working to end it. In fact, Congress has greenlit an $18 billion sale of F-15s to Israel. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2114.2400000000002s)]
*  Now, I don't think those will be there in time to be a part of this war, but there's just zero [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2119.12s)]
*  momentum seemingly to pressure Israel to just get to a ceasefire. Yeah. I mean, there's this alarming [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2122.96s)]
*  ISIS wing that seems to be in part in Afghanistan, seems to be recruited heavily from Tajikistan. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2128.2400000000002s)]
*  We saw the Tajik members of ISIS carry out an attack, looked like in Russia. Yeah. People [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2135.04s)]
*  remember that attack that took place in Moscow. And look, stepping back, you make the core point [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2142.08s)]
*  here, which is one of the questions that people don't even bother to ask is, is the war in Gaza [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2147.92s)]
*  in America's interest? Clearly, no. It's making us less safe at this point. It's badly damaged our [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2152.72s)]
*  international credibility. It makes us look like hypocrites when we're arguing for a rules-based [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2160.16s)]
*  approach to the war in Ukraine. It's causing all this instability across the Middle East, [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2165.44s)]
*  which by the way, has cost the United States tens or billions, certainly of dollars, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2170.56s)]
*  in four deployments in the Red Sea with the Houthis or moving assets to the region. This is not in [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2174.96s)]
*  our interest. And so why do we continue to provide the weapons that sustain the war? [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2180.0s)]
*  I made three points trying to step back in that Foreign Affairs article of mine [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2188.24s)]
*  about the mindset that needs to shift and what they are quickly, Tommy, is one, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2192.72s)]
*  the kind of political analysis that I can't break from Israel. That's an outdated view [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2197.2s)]
*  of American politics. I would argue it's more costly. Yeah, it's more costly to give Israel, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2202.96s)]
*  this Israeli government in particular, a blank check than it would be to actually have a policy [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2208.72s)]
*  in line with American interests. The second problem is signing on to maximalist objectives. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2213.68s)]
*  And if you support the war continuing with the stated goal of destroying Hamas, well, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2219.12s)]
*  the war is never going to end because you're not going to ever destroy Hamas. It's an idea. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2225.44s)]
*  It's a movement. It's not just in Gaza itself. And then the third thing is we need to be able [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2229.44s)]
*  to look at our own policy from the outside in. What does this look like? If the swing state [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2233.6s)]
*  audience, to take a political analogy in the world, is the global South, just imagine what [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2238.08s)]
*  the war in Gaza looks like in terms of double standards. So for all these reasons and the [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2243.12s)]
*  terrorist threat, I think, makes it acute, it's time to look at this war through the prism of [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2247.52s)]
*  American interests here. And there's no interest in a kind of open-ended war in Gaza that the US [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2253.28s)]
*  is fully supporting. Totally agree. It's a complete and total madness. Speaking of which, Ben, [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2257.76s)]
*  let's turn to France. How about that transition? Last week, we talked about French President [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2263.0400000000004s)]
*  Emmanuel Macron's surprising and very risky decision to call snap elections in France after [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2267.52s)]
*  his party got crushed in the elections for the European Parliament. Now it increasingly looks [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2273.36s)]
*  like the results of these snap elections could be disastrous for Macron. So there's two key data [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2277.84s)]
*  points. First is that the four far left parties in France, the communists, the socialists, the [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2282.48s)]
*  greens, and a party called the LFI, have decided to come together and run under one platform called [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2287.92s)]
*  the New Popular Front. What that means in practice is that these parties won't be competing with each [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2292.96s)]
*  other in these French, basically congressional districts, they're going to run one candidate [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2297.6s)]
*  in each district to avoid splitting the vote. And then the second data point is some recent [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2301.92s)]
*  polling, which shows that Macron's party is in deep trouble. The far left coalition is getting [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2305.76s)]
*  about 25% of the vote. National rally, the far right party is getting like 30 to 35% of the vote. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2310.8s)]
*  But Macron's party is getting less than 20% of the vote. And so again, French parliamentary [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2316.48s)]
*  elections have two rounds. The first round, I think is June 30th. The second round is July 7th. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2320.7200000000003s)]
*  If no candidate gets 50% in the first round, which very rarely happens, then candidates who get over [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2326.4s)]
*  12.5% of the vote get to compete in the second round in the runoff. Macron gambled that his [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2331.92s)]
*  coalition would end up pitted against the far right and these runoffs, and then he could win [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2337.76s)]
*  those races. But if this polling is accurate, it looks like his coalition might not even make [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2341.92s)]
*  the runoff in most districts, let alone win seats. The campaign may end up being primarily far left [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2346.88s)]
*  coalitions versus far right coalitions. And so look, we're talking about 577 different elections [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2352.96s)]
*  in different districts with different elect, you know, people involve local issues, etc. So [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2358.5600000000004s)]
*  it's hard to predict. And there's some questions about how strong this left wing alliance really [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2363.2799999999997s)]
*  is. Will people listen to their leaders or will they just do their own thing? But when the runoff [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2368.16s)]
*  is over on July 7th, some French political analysts are predicting that Macron could go from having [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2372.56s)]
*  250 seats in the assembly to less than 100. Le Figaro newspaper, which I read all the time, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2378.3999999999996s)]
*  did some modeling based on the European Parliament elections that found Macron's coalition might only [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2384.72s)]
*  make it to the runoff in 41 National Assembly districts out of 577. So this would just be like [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2389.44s)]
*  a wipeout for this guy. And so Ben, I think that raises the question, if this happens, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2395.6s)]
*  do we need to revisit our conversation last week about whether Rishi Sunak's decision to skip D-Day [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2400.64s)]
*  was the biggest cell phone in recent political history? [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2405.76s)]
*  Well, we very well may, although again, for Rishi Sunak, it's a little more existential because that [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2409.84s)]
*  guy will be out of the job after July 4th. Whereas Macron, even if he gets pasted, he can still be [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2414.08s)]
*  president, still live in the Elysee, still preside over the Olympics opening ceremony as president [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2419.6s)]
*  for a couple of years. But yes, if I was arguing the kind of Macron five dimensional chess point [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2424.3199999999997s)]
*  of view last week and you were arguing the catastrophe, the early returns are certainly good [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2429.7599999999998s)]
*  for the catastrophe argument. It does just feel like Macron, his party, the movement that he [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2434.08s)]
*  started, the kind of neoliberal centrist politics, that's just not where the French are right now. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2440.8s)]
*  I will say the left come coalescing, I think is a good thing in the sense that you've had this kind [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2447.6000000000004s)]
*  of fracturing of left wing parties, the traditional socialist party kind of collapsed, and then you [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2453.28s)]
*  have all these different parties. I generally think it's actually good that people are saying, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2458.6400000000003s)]
*  let's band together, give more of a coherent choice. And that could be a positive aspect of this. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2462.48s)]
*  And I'll also say there is this kind of weird benefit that could happen, which is that even [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2470.08s)]
*  if the far right wins, and I mentioned this last week, then they kind of are responsible for [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2476.0s)]
*  governance to some degree for a couple of years. I would rather they win this parliamentary election [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2481.36s)]
*  and lose the next presidential election, given the French system putting so much power in the [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2486.72s)]
*  presidential presidency. So that's still the medium term thing to watch. But yeah, man, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2490.96s)]
*  Macron does not seem to have his finger on the pulse of the electorate. Let's just hope that [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2495.92s)]
*  enough French people coalesce around candidates so that the far right doesn't get kind of a clear [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2500.64s)]
*  majority in the assembly. That would be a win at this point. Yeah. I mean, look, this would be like [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2505.12s)]
*  President Obama calling a snap election just days after the 2010 midterms when we got our asses [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2509.92s)]
*  handed to us. And even in the near term, Ben, the French stock market dropped like 6% last week, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2514.64s)]
*  because everyone is worried about the potential of the far right to rise. And look, I'm with you, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2520.32s)]
*  listen, if given a choice between Marine Le Pen's party and literally anyone, I will vote for anyone [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2525.36s)]
*  else, but there are some pretty odious members of this far left coalition too, who kind of welcomed [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2530.72s)]
*  October 7th and said some awful things. But you're right. Oh yeah. Interestingly, Macron came out of [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2536.56s)]
*  nowhere to kind of create this centrist party. He just made it up on his own, Elmarche, and he kind [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2542.88s)]
*  of exploded French politics. In the process, he kind of killed off the traditional French Republicans. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2550.0s)]
*  And after this election was announced, the traditional Republican party, Les Republicans, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2558.48s)]
*  when the party leader announced they would do a deal with Le Pen, the rest of the party lost [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2565.2s)]
*  their mind. They said, no, you won't. These guys, half the party members stormed the Les [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2568.56s)]
*  Republicans office and they tried to physically enter his office and push him out. They were [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2573.76s)]
*  tweeting that he'd been kicked out of the party. There was another Twitter account where he was [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2578.48s)]
*  saying, no, I have not. I'm still here. It's just like complete disaster and a mess. So I don't know. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2582.96s)]
*  Well, I guess we'll know for sure, but it's ugly. And I guess the good news, I'll give you guys some [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2588.2400000000002s)]
*  good news. There is a lot of energy against the far right. So last weekend, I think there's about [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2593.84s)]
*  a quarter of a million people on the streets protesting against Marine Le Pen and the far right. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2597.6s)]
*  And they also got a boost from the captain of the national soccer team, Kylian Mbappe. Let's listen [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2602.08s)]
*  to a clip of that. I'd like to address all the French people, especially the younger generation. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2606.96s)]
*  We are a generation that can make a difference. Today, it's clear that the extremes are on the [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2612.32s)]
*  doorstep of power. We have the opportunity to choose the future of our country. And that's [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2617.44s)]
*  why I'm calling on all young people to go out and vote to really realize the importance of the [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2622.56s)]
*  situation. We need to identify with values of diversity, tolerance and respect. Good from [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2627.68s)]
*  Mbappe, man. I'm sure he will take some real heat for being an athlete, especially a black athlete, [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2634.96s)]
*  talking about political issues. But well said, thoughtful, courageous thing to say, I think. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2640.4s)]
*  Yeah. I think that takes real guts. And we haven't seen a lot of athletes in Europe, [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2645.28s)]
*  in soccer players, particularly where big followings take that step. And look, I mean, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2650.16s)]
*  I always think the French getting pretty xenophobic here in their immigration politics [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2653.84s)]
*  and their racial politics. And yet they seem to have no, Le Bleu, the French national soccer team, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2659.52s)]
*  let's just say that looks like the benefits of diversity manifests in a community that the French [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2664.8s)]
*  people care about. So good for him on calling that out. And it does speak to like, again, [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2671.2000000000003s)]
*  the challenges. Macron tried to push everybody the far left and far right by owning the center. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2676.8s)]
*  And I think part of what you want to see is not just the mobilization that Mbappe is calling for, [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2682.88s)]
*  but the left needs to reestablish itself and deal with some of the strangeness. And it's fine, [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2687.52s)]
*  I'd frankly like to see a healthier center right than Marine Le Pen there. And so hopefully if more [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2694.56s)]
*  people get involved in politics, then you're not just kind of leaving it to the far left and the [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2699.44s)]
*  far right. And then this guy, Macron, that's kind of what has to happen. Well, at least the medium [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2703.7599999999998s)]
*  term in France. But good to see people like that speaking out. I'd like to see more of that in this [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2708.8799999999997s)]
*  country and more of that around the world. Yeah. Mbappe was born in Paris, I believe, but his father [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2713.68s)]
*  is from part of Cameroon. His mother is Algerian. So yes, he is sort of exactly the picture of the [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2719.68s)]
*  diversity that you're talking about. And the Euro soccer tournament is happening right now. So [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2728.24s)]
*  as French citizens decide whether to vote for Marine Le Pen, they're watching Mbappe play and [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2733.7599999999998s)]
*  cheering him on. Ben, speaking of protests, let's turn to Argentina, because there were huge protests [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2739.12s)]
*  there last week after President Javier Mille narrowly pushed through two massive reform bills that [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2744.88s)]
*  he claims are necessary to pull Argentina out of its decades long economic spiral. So these two laws [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2750.32s)]
*  would grant the president the power to declare a state of economic emergency, cut pensions, [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2756.2400000000002s)]
*  privatize some state owned firms and weaken labor protections. Mille has faced stiff opposition from [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2761.6000000000004s)]
*  political opponents within Congress to this plan and some violent protests outside of it. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2766.96s)]
*  Dozens of protesters were hospitalized after clashes with police, including five opposition [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2771.76s)]
*  MPs who are part of the crowd. Mille was elected president last November with about 55% of the vote. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2776.32s)]
*  He described himself at the time as an anarcho capitalist who is willing to take a chainsaw to [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2783.0400000000004s)]
*  public spending and basically the political system itself. In fact, he used to love to bring an [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2788.0800000000004s)]
*  actual chainsaw to events and hold it up looking like a psycho Wolverine style X-Men character. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2792.48s)]
*  But since getting elected, he's taken a bunch of steps. He's devalued Argentina's currency. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2798.56s)]
*  He's slashed the size of government. He's cut fuel subsidies. We spoke to Buenos Aires based [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2802.56s)]
*  freelance journalist Daniel Politi about what these austerity measures are looking like for [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2807.36s)]
*  ordinary Argentinians. Here's a clip. The social stuff that's happening in Argentina, [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2812.0s)]
*  I think, is interesting. It's not getting that much attention in the way that what austerity has [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2816.0s)]
*  meant to the people of Argentina. A strong austerity that Mille has ushered has meant [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2821.92s)]
*  soup kitchens are empty pretty much. The government has pretty much stopped sending money to soup [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2831.2000000000003s)]
*  kitchens at a time when poverty has increased. Figures have shown that poverty has increased. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2836.48s)]
*  Mille has managed to decelerate inflation. I mean, last month's inflation numbers just came [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2841.92s)]
*  out. They were the lowest since 2022. Argentina still has almost 300% annual inflation rate. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2848.48s)]
*  He's really using this. He came into office promising a lower inflation rate. He's delivering [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2858.16s)]
*  in that sense what cost and the cost of austerity, what's happening to unemployment. Unemployment [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2863.92s)]
*  has already started to increase. I think for now, Mille still has this breathing room. He's still, [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2869.92s)]
*  if we can call it, in this honeymoon period. The big question is, how long will it last? [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2875.92s)]
*  How long will Argentinian people be willing to put up with this pain in order for some [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2881.76s)]
*  promised better future? As you mentioned, the spending cuts have moved Argentina from a fiscal [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2888.16s)]
*  deficit to a surplus. The month-over-month inflation rate fell to about 9%. Again, [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2892.88s)]
*  annual inflation is 300%, which is unthinkable for us. Argentina owes the IMF about $44 billion. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2898.4s)]
*  They've got a steep hill to climb. Mille has become a celebrity in right-wing circles in the [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2904.96s)]
*  US. He spoke at CPAC earlier this year. There's a clip of him giving Trump this big, weird, [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2910.56s)]
*  enthusiastic hug. He was also in the US meeting with big tech leaders, including Elon Musk, [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2914.8s)]
*  who he's been buddy-buddy with on Twitter as well. Elon basically just wants access to Argentina's [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2920.8s)]
*  supply of lithium, which is a key component for electric vehicle batteries. Musk has called [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2925.76s)]
*  lithium the new oil. Mille is a departure from some of the right-wing populists we talk about [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2930.88s)]
*  often who are successful because they combine these conservative positions on social issues [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2937.12s)]
*  like abortion or immigration, along with an expansion of social programs in the welfare [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2942.96s)]
*  state. Mille is very much not doing that. He's basically pairing super conservative social views [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2947.6800000000003s)]
*  with austerity measures that you might expect from the Tory party in the UK or Macron in France. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2954.08s)]
*  Do you think that's going to work? It seems like it's got the potential to make nobody happy to me. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2960.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think that's going to work. I mean, he's got the tear it all down [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2966.0s)]
*  right-wing populism of other leaders, but then he has this kind of extreme libertarian, [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2969.92s)]
*  Milton Friedman kind of ... I mean, you mentioned Elon Musk. Mille could fit right in on the all-in [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2975.52s)]
*  pod, Tommy. You could slide right in there next to David Sacks. But put that aside. I think the [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2981.2s)]
*  concerning thing here is that when Mille got elected, it was like, how far is he going to go [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2989.6s)]
*  in two areas? One is in terms of his libertarian fantasies, his anarcho-capitalist fantasies [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=2993.8399999999997s)]
*  of austerity and gutting the state. And then two was how undemocratic was he going to be and how [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3000.7999999999997s)]
*  much was he going to challenge institutions of Argentina's democracy. And unfortunately, [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3007.2s)]
*  after a relatively restrained beginning, it seems like he's accelerating in both spaces, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3012.16s)]
*  because he's really beginning to take that chainsaw to the Argentina state. And that's [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3018.56s)]
*  going to have a long tail in terms of declining social services, poverty, people really suffering [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3024.64s)]
*  because of those policies. But also, it's a national economic emergency. He's kind of [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3031.84s)]
*  ramming this stuff through. It does feel like we're now seeing the person that people were [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3037.52s)]
*  concerned about. And honestly, I feel like that's going to end badly for everybody, including Mille. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3042.64s)]
*  If you've got huge economic disruptions, you're going to get more street protests and more [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3048.96s)]
*  instability in that way. And if he's going after the functioning of the state, well, he doesn't [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3054.0s)]
*  have a big political party backing him. So I think he could end up being quite isolated. But the [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3059.3599999999997s)]
*  problem is it's probably not going to be very good for people in Argentina in the immediate future. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3065.92s)]
*  He definitely needs to get inflation under control. But man, it's going to be [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3071.6s)]
*  unbelievably painful to get there if this is how he's going to do it. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3074.88s)]
*  And then finally, Ben, listeners might have opened Instagram or Twitter in the last week and wondered, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3078.4s)]
*  why is every single late night TV host or comedian from the 90s hanging out with the pope? [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3084.0s)]
*  It turns out that is because Pope Francis invited more than 100 comedians from around the world to [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3091.3599999999997s)]
*  visit to, quote, establish a link between the Catholic Church and comic artists. Yes, the [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3096.08s)]
*  famously lighthearted funny Catholic Church. Some of the American attendees include Jimmy Fallon, [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3101.92s)]
*  Stephen Colbert, Chris Rock, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Whoopi Goldberg. Here's a clip of Whoopi [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3107.52s)]
*  Goldberg talking about the meeting. I thought, OK, I'm going to walk into [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3112.72s)]
*  this building and I'm going to burst into flames. But as it turns out, I did not. And [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3116.72s)]
*  I brought him some stuff from from Sister Act and he requested. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3124.56s)]
*  He asked for it. Everybody loves Sister Act. The pope. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3129.52s)]
*  It's a great movie, but both of them. The pope later with the G7. He delivered a speech and [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3134.56s)]
*  reportedly asked for stronger guardrails for artificial intelligence. I'm sure that was a [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3138.64s)]
*  highly technical conversation. Then the pope met with Biden one on one. Biden's obviously the [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3143.52s)]
*  second ever Catholic president and deeply religious person. I'm guessing they didn't [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3148.96s)]
*  discuss reports that the pope has been repeatedly using anti-gay slurs during meetings at the [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3154.32s)]
*  Vatican. Ben, why is the pope doing influencer outreach? Is that what's happening here? [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3159.04s)]
*  It appears to me what's happening here. I mean, I guess they were thinking like there's [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3164.08s)]
*  going to be a big spotlight on Italy, on Rome and on the Vatican. And so we might as well do [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3167.92s)]
*  whatever we can to make use of it. I mean, look, I will say that on balance and you mentioned these [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3173.44s)]
*  slurs that he used behind closed doors. So this is not to kind of look at the pope [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3179.76s)]
*  wholly with rose colored glasses. I do think you have to look at it relative to [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3183.92s)]
*  the history of the Catholic Church and frankly, relative to other leaders around the world. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3188.96s)]
*  The good thing about Pope Francis is he seems to continue to be trying to provide some degree of [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3193.12s)]
*  moral leadership in the world. He's been outspoken on climate change. He's now raising issues around [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3199.44s)]
*  artificial intelligence and guardrails that frankly, I think political leaders need to take on [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3204.08s)]
*  as the kind of challenge almost up there with climate change in terms of protecting humanity [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3208.96s)]
*  going forward. Well, maybe not that close, but it's definitely in the next tier down. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3213.92s)]
*  And actually, he's taken some steps to open up a little bit the Catholic Church on issues around [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3219.12s)]
*  LGBT. Hopefully, the reports of these slurs can push him in the right direction on those issues. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3223.44s)]
*  And so I think he was trying to kind of use this platform to get attention on how he's trying to [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3230.32s)]
*  change and evolve the Catholic Church. Reaching out to a bunch of comedians, probably almost all [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3236.0s)]
*  of whom have told Catholic jokes or done something that the church wouldn't like in the past. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3240.64s)]
*  I think that's in line with Pope Francis kind of signaling, hey, we're in a new era. We're trying [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3246.88s)]
*  to have a sense of humor about ourselves. We're trying to kind of open up to kind of audiences [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3252.48s)]
*  that have reach with younger populations, but also that might have once been at odds with us. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3257.52s)]
*  But I was kind of, Tommy, I know you've done Colbert and we love Stephen Colbert. And frankly, [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3263.2000000000003s)]
*  I like all these light-night hosts. It was like very late night forward. It was like Conan O'Brien, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3269.36s)]
*  Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon. So again, no offense to the late night hosts whatsoever, [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3274.8799999999997s)]
*  but that's a slightly older demographic. It was kind of our generation of comedians too, [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3282.8799999999997s)]
*  Chris Rock. So they got to find who the kids these days think are funny. The next one is going to [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3288.16s)]
*  have to have some YouTubers and TikTok comedians. Yeah, I think Colbert is a deeply religious guy [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3294.0s)]
*  and a Catholic. Yeah, you're right. I'm not excusing anything the Pope said. I do think [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3300.24s)]
*  when you compare him to his predecessor, Pope Benedict, he does seem like a much better influence [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3305.2799999999997s)]
*  in the world. I think it's kind of interesting, frankly, that the Catholic church is doing [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3311.4399999999996s)]
*  influencer marketing. I mean, that's the thing that political campaigns have just started doing [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3317.8399999999997s)]
*  as well. And if you think about it, Ben, Jesus was the original influencer. So there's a long [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3322.4799999999996s)]
*  history there. But yeah, I guess good for them. It was an incredible experience. I initially [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3327.12s)]
*  thought Biden invited all these guys. Like what's happening? Well, it's a sign by the way that [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3332.24s)]
*  of the allure of the Pope, right? Of both that office, right? But also Pope Francis, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3338.08s)]
*  that all these people went. Totally. There are not many places in the world or people in the [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3343.6s)]
*  world that could say, hey, we want to have a bunch of comedians and that kind of star power shows up. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3347.2799999999997s)]
*  So it does remind you that I think particularly Pope Francis, but also the institution itself, [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3351.2s)]
*  it matters. And insofar as it's incrementally opening up, that's to the good. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3356.56s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. That's it for the news section. We're going to take a quick break. But when we come [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3362.56s)]
*  back, you will hear Ben's conversation with Congresswoman Ilhan Omar about all things Sudan [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3366.08s)]
*  and Gaza. So stick around for that. We are very pleased to welcome back to Pod Save the World, [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3370.56s)]
*  Congresswoman Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who has always got a lot of interesting things to say, [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3375.7599999999998s)]
*  but also today is going to talk about and frankly announce a letter that she's sending [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3380.24s)]
*  to the administration when this podcast drops. But Congresswoman, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3387.52s)]
*  Thank you for having me, Ben. Okay. So we've been talking about the situation, [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3392.56s)]
*  the horrific humanitarian situation in Sudan. And one of the things that people have really [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3397.44s)]
*  been struggling with is what can we do? What more could be done to help people, [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3403.6s)]
*  such a tremendous amount of people are in such horrific needs. You've now called for there to be [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3408.72s)]
*  a humanitarian parole program for people impacted by the war in Sudan, similar to what we've had for [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3415.28s)]
*  people from Afghanistan and Ukraine. Just to begin, explain a bit about what that means, [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3421.36s)]
*  who that affects and why you took this step. Yeah. Well, thank you again for having me and [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3428.2400000000002s)]
*  for spotlighting our work in regards to Sudan, what is taking place, the civil war in Sudan is [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3433.28s)]
*  probably one of the most horrific civil wars that we've seen in a really long time. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3439.52s)]
*  It's experiencing one of the worst famines in 40 years that has been recorded. There's millions [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3445.6800000000003s)]
*  and millions of people that are being displaced. There's again, the accusation of genocide that's [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3451.44s)]
*  taking place in Darfur. And I think there are a couple of things that the United States obviously [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3456.48s)]
*  can do. One of them is to provide parole, which is a relief for so many people. It allows for them [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3462.1600000000003s)]
*  to be able to come to the United States. I think when we were thinking about just the horrors of [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3470.64s)]
*  what people are experiencing and our ability to have already done it for the people that were [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3478.32s)]
*  fleeing Afghanistan after the withdrawal, the people of Ukraine after the invasion of the Russian [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3485.2s)]
*  troops, I think it is time for us to allow for that same relief to be provided to the Sudanese [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3493.6s)]
*  people. I am grateful to Sarah Jacobs, who is the co-lead on this letter that we are sending to the [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3501.8399999999997s)]
*  administration. We have about two dozen of our colleagues that are on this letter and the letter [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3510.16s)]
*  goes out today. And what do you think the possibilities are that the administration [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3517.7599999999998s)]
*  will be open to this kind of approach? This is actually exactly what the humanitarian [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3523.12s)]
*  parole program was designed for this kind of circumstance where there's no question about the [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3528.0s)]
*  vulnerability of the people who are impacted or facing everything from genocidal violence [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3533.3599999999997s)]
*  in Darfur to famine conditions in parts of the country. At the same time, we've obviously seen [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3541.44s)]
*  kind of a building anti-immigrant, empty refugee sentiment and even border policies getting much [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3547.2799999999997s)]
*  firmer out of the Biden administration. Are you hopeful that you can make some headway here in [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3554.48s)]
*  opening some doors to some people who desperately need literally asylum? [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3559.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we've had some preliminary conversations with the administration. We've [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3563.52s)]
*  had this conversation with the envoy that was assigned to deal with the civil war in Sudan. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3570.88s)]
*  We feel that the administration might be receptive. I don't know how quickly they [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3582.2400000000002s)]
*  might be able to get it done. Our hope is that this sort of compassion has been present with the [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3586.1600000000003s)]
*  Biden administration and we hope that that compassion is going to be extended to the [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3594.48s)]
*  Sudanese people, as you said, who are experiencing just severe atrocities and the world seems to [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3599.52s)]
*  not be paying attention. I think the humanitarian crisis in itself, to see so many millions of [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3608.64s)]
*  people cross the border into South Sudan, into Chad, into Ethiopia, that is also experiencing [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3615.7599999999998s)]
*  atrocities, to have millions internally displaced, I think it is imperative for us to show care and [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3624.08s)]
*  compassion to the Sudanese people who have suffered for a really long time. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3637.92s)]
*  Just stepping, taking a bigger view of things, this would obviously help people who can get here. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3642.64s)]
*  Hopefully there's people with family, there are people with connections in the US who may try to [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3649.12s)]
*  find safety and security, but there are obviously, in any case, still so many vulnerable people. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3657.92s)]
*  There's 10 million people displaced, as you've said, that's beginning to create challenges in [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3666.16s)]
*  neighboring countries. A horrific death toll already that the US envoy, Tom Perriello, [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3670.96s)]
*  suggested it could become as high as 150,000. And yet there seems to be no end in sight to the war. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3677.2000000000003s)]
*  What policy tools would you like to see the US using? What can be done from the perspective [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3686.88s)]
*  of the international community to try to address both the humanitarian needs but also the political [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3693.6s)]
*  dispute and some of the regional powers have been pouring in weapons? What tools are available to [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3699.2000000000003s)]
*  the US that you'd like to see us be using? Well, obviously there are always tools available [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3704.72s)]
*  to the United States. One is to look at, there are two entities that have really some real leverage [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3712.24s)]
*  that we have a relationship with. One is the Saudis. The Saudis really want to be at the table [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3724.24s)]
*  and the leads in negotiating a ceasefire. And they've been an obstacle to [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3735.04s)]
*  the support that some of the other ones that are leading or have attempted to lead a ceasefire [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3743.2s)]
*  negotiations, whether it's the Egyptians or the Kenyans or other players within the region that [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3750.64s)]
*  have had a few conferences so far in trying to get the RSF and the Sudanese army to really [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3761.28s)]
*  stop taking up arms and the civil war and eventually transition into a civilian-led [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3775.6800000000003s)]
*  government. So we could pressure the Saudis to either fully carry out the negotiations that [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3783.8399999999997s)]
*  they want to carry or step aside and allow for the other regional entities that are designating [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3794.0s)]
*  themselves to be able to lead those negotiations. The other one is the United Arab Emirates. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3805.36s)]
*  They are accused of being the primary suppliers of the RSF in regards to weapons. We know that [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3815.52s)]
*  those weapons that have been spotted have been weapons that the UAE has purchased from the United [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3827.28s)]
*  States. I've led an effort for us not to sell them weapons until they stop arming the RSF. I know that [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3834.72s)]
*  my colleague, Congresswoman Sarah Jacobs, is leading a renewed effort into doing that. I think those [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3844.8799999999997s)]
*  are quick steps that we can take and I think in regards to supporting the Sudanese people as they [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3853.8399999999997s)]
*  struggle is to increase the humanitarian aid that we are providing to give more support to our envoy, [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3861.28s)]
*  to do the parole that we just talked about. We are not without tools in our toolbox in trying to [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3875.92s)]
*  help address the civil war that is happening in Sudan. It sounds like if you take a kind of [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3883.52s)]
*  comprehensive approach like you described, you have diplomatic leverage on some of the parties [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3888.32s)]
*  that are like the Saudis and the Emiratis have been both arming and fueling the conflict. You [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3892.2400000000002s)]
*  have the need for more humanitarian assistance and then you have the need for this kind of generosity [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3899.1200000000003s)]
*  in terms of humanitarian parole. A common thread between Gaza and Sudan is that the U.S. is providing [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3903.6800000000003s)]
*  these arms to the Emiratis and Saudis that find their way to the RSF, to Israel that have been [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3912.32s)]
*  used in Gaza. Is there a growing appetite to take a look at, because U.S. foreign policy [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3918.6400000000003s)]
*  people are often wondering why doesn't the Global South support our foreign policy agenda? Why is [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3927.52s)]
*  it so hard to get countries to care about Ukraine? And yet, this is kind of staring us in the face [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3932.0s)]
*  that part of the issue is that it's U.S. weapons that are being used and right now the two most [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3936.96s)]
*  terrific alongside Ukraine conflicts in the world. Is there something that could be done to take a [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3941.2s)]
*  more holistic look at who we're arming and what the actual tools are? Because in Israel, [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3949.3599999999997s)]
*  there are tools like the Leahy Law and things that would suggest that we should be restricting those [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3955.52s)]
*  arms flows. Is there a way to surface those more in Congress? Are people willing to take a harder [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3960.96s)]
*  look at this? Yeah, I mean, that's why I introduced the Stop Arming Human Rights [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3965.92s)]
*  Violators Act, the SARA Act. And I think it's important for us to have a holistic look [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3970.96s)]
*  and be able to make the determinations on the front end instead of meal piecing [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3980.0s)]
*  the approach that we've had instead of continuing with the approach that we've had in place. I think, [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3986.96s)]
*  you know, speaking of the Leahy Law, that we know that that's now being violated in by the Israeli [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=3997.36s)]
*  army and we haven't taken any action. And I think if we are serious, we should bring back [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4005.76s)]
*  that leverage and the legislative tools and oversight to members of Congress. And the fact [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4014.8799999999997s)]
*  that we have relegated our power to be able to have oversight to make those decisions to the [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4024.9599999999996s)]
*  executive branch really shows that there are not too many members of Congress that are too concerned [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4032.9599999999996s)]
*  in overseeing the pieces of legislation that they pass and making sure that those pieces of [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4042.16s)]
*  legislation are carried out in the way that they were designed to be carried out. So on Gaza, [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4048.3199999999997s)]
*  specifically, you've called for a halt to providing weapons to Israel for some time now. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4054.16s)]
*  You know, that's a position I've advocated. At the same time, I want to kind of bring together [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4061.3599999999997s)]
*  the politics and policy of this because at the same time that we see this kind of building concern, [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4065.92s)]
*  obviously, from the Biden administration rhetorically, they've yet to kind of really [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4071.2s)]
*  take that step. You know, they've withheld, you know, I think one shipment of offensive weapons. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4075.2799999999997s)]
*  And now we see at the same time that the war cabinet is unraveled in Israel, the one place [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4080.96s)]
*  where Bibi Netanyahu can seem to get a big welcome is in the United States Congress with the [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4087.2s)]
*  bipartisan leadership inviting him to speak to Congress. And so we have this kind of interesting [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4093.3599999999997s)]
*  intersection of a policy that is not working because if one of the goals of the policy is to [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4099.92s)]
*  limit the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, get more aid in and get to a ceasefire, you know, [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4106.56s)]
*  that has not worked. Pretty clearly, a big piece of that is Prime Minister Netanyahu himself. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4111.6s)]
*  And at the same time, though, we see this kind of political embrace of Netanyahu. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4117.68s)]
*  We also see in the Democratic Party, AIPAC, spending a lot of money in primaries, and that [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4122.4800000000005s)]
*  may come your way. They're focused right now on Jamal Bowman, Bowman seat in New York, but that's [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4128.8s)]
*  not the only one where AIPAC is trying to kind of punish people that don't take a wholly supportive [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4133.2s)]
*  line of the Israeli government. Where do you see the political and policy debate in the Democratic [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4138.8s)]
*  Party on support for the Israeli government right now? Because on the one hand, you're seeing more [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4146.8s)]
*  criticism than we've seen before, given what's happened in Gaza. And on the other hand, not much [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4151.52s)]
*  has changed substantively or in terms of even the optics of inviting Netanyahu. And we still [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4156.24s)]
*  have AIPAC kind of getting involved in Democratic primaries. So where do you see, you know, on the [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4160.719999999999s)]
*  spectrum, the current state of the Democratic Party's view of this relationship with the Israeli [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4165.12s)]
*  government? I mean, we have, as you said, we haven't seen a shift and we might not see a shift in a [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4171.44s)]
*  really long time. You know, I've come to the realization that this is a very entrenched policy [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4177.68s)]
*  position that Democrats, Republicans, regardless of whatever administration we have, regardless of, [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4186.96s)]
*  you know, where members of Congress represent that this is sort of, you know, our ally, we do [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4194.56s)]
*  whatever it is that they ask. And we're not going to see a shift in that until we change the people [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4201.52s)]
*  who are in these seats, right? And we have to make sure that they are not people who get there with [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4206.88s)]
*  the support and the financial backing of AIPAC so that they can be, they can have the independence [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4215.599999999999s)]
*  to make decisions that are both good for our country and sort of allow for them to lead [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4222.799999999999s)]
*  with their conscience, with their humanity and their morals intact. It is quite unfortunate to [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4231.44s)]
*  see so many of our Democratic colleagues put out these statements calling for a ceasefire saying, [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4238.4s)]
*  you know, Netanyahu is not a partner for peace, saying we should condition aid, saying Netanyahu [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4244.719999999999s)]
*  should not be invited. And then when push comes to shove, they'll vote for the aid. They will sign [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4252.24s)]
*  on to the letter of invitation, just like Chuck Schumer did. You know, we were all really excited [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4258.96s)]
*  about the moral clarity that he showed when he made that speech on the Senate floor. And then [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4266.72s)]
*  months later, to actually invite the man that he said was not a partner of peace to come address [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4272.88s)]
*  the, to give him the honor of having a joint session in front of Congress really shows you [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4280.4800000000005s)]
*  how much of a disconnect there is between what people are willing to say and what they're willing [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4287.6s)]
*  to actually do. And the fact that their actions do not, are not in lockstep with their words, [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4293.280000000001s)]
*  shows you how much pressure is out there. We know that that pressure mostly comes from AIPAC. And [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4300.96s)]
*  I think in order for us to be able to withstand that pressure, we have to take the financial [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4309.84s)]
*  incentive that is attached to that pressure away. And that's why big money and dark money in politics [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4317.12s)]
*  really has shifted the way in which this country is governed. And it is, I think, a detrimental and a [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4325.28s)]
*  threat to democracy, to a representative democracy and something has to give. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4333.76s)]
*  Well, you know, I'm going to ask you one more question that kind of ties back to [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4342.88s)]
*  where we began, but obviously Gaza is a part of it. You know, we've seen, for instance, [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4348.08s)]
*  on the National Defense Authorization, which is the massive spending bill that Republicans love [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4352.8s)]
*  to attach very problematic amendments to, you know, there's something barring, I think, you know, [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4357.84s)]
*  any Palestinians from coming into the country, you know, kind of vindictive policies like that. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4363.2s)]
*  But we've, I mean, generally seen, you know, xenophobia kind of creeping in. Obviously, [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4367.76s)]
*  it's kind of a feature, not a bug of Republican politics, but also kind of public opinion, [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4376.24s)]
*  you know, turning against, you know, asylum procedures. It's World Refugee Day coming up [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4381.76s)]
*  on June 20th. You obviously, you know, your personal story, you're a former refugee from [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4390.88s)]
*  Somalia. You've seen in your district, I know, the benefits culturally and economically to having a [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4396.4800000000005s)]
*  vibrant immigrant community. How do we kind of reintroduce the benefits, both moral and humanitarian [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4402.8s)]
*  benefits of compassion, but also the necessity to, you know, both global stability, but also [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4412.8s)]
*  the domestic economic and cultural benefits of an orderly migration system that includes [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4422.24s)]
*  compassion for refugees in an environment where there are lots of concerns that people have about [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4429.28s)]
*  the border and there's kind of the pendulum has swung against compassion. Yeah, I mean, [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4435.2s)]
*  Republicans have now developed a brand of punching down and it's really unfortunate. I think, [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4440.32s)]
*  you know, for me, I've been in this country now 29 years. In 1995, our family was fortunate enough [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4448.96s)]
*  to be resettled in the United States and benefit from the Refugee Resettlement Program, which, [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4456.16s)]
*  since the Obama era has not really fulfilled its promise and the number of slots that have been [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4464.24s)]
*  allocated have never really been fully taken advantage of. You know, people are not showing up [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4471.92s)]
*  at our border. People are not showing up at borders throughout the world and be made into [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4480.96s)]
*  refugees because it is fun. It is something that they want to do, right? People are being [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4489.6s)]
*  displaced because of war. People are being displaced because of the climate crisis. People [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4495.76s)]
*  are being displaced because of violence, lack of opportunity. And so these are people who have to [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4500.320000000001s)]
*  leave everything that is known to them in order to seek shelter. And so there's no one more grateful, [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4508.160000000001s)]
*  no one more hopeful, no one more joyful than a refugee who has lost their home and everything [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4516.16s)]
*  that they knew that is now given an opportunity to start over and to find shelter, to find [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4522.96s)]
*  access to food and to resources. And that gratefulness shows up in their service. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4532.08s)]
*  That gratefulness shows up in the educational opportunities that they provide to the societies [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4538.4s)]
*  that they are placed in. That shows up in the economic opportunities that they create because [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4544.88s)]
*  most of them have entrepreneurial spirit. That shows up in the way that they really uplift [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4549.76s)]
*  that American story of America being a beacon of hope. And I think, you know, when I talk to, [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4558.32s)]
*  you know, my staff, my constituents, my relatives who all have an immigrant story [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4566.56s)]
*  from, you know, decades, generations, they all remember, you know, my great grandmother migrated [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4579.4400000000005s)]
*  here. You know, my husband's relatives left Ireland because of the potato famine. Like everybody [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4587.04s)]
*  remembers, there's this pride, there's this story about, you know, they came here with $20 [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4594.24s)]
*  in their pocket. They came here through, you know, Alice Island. So all of those stories are stories [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4599.36s)]
*  that make the American story. And people need to be reminded that this is, unless you are Indigenous [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4606.88s)]
*  or you're someone who is a descendant of the enslaved and you came here in shackles, everyone [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4615.5199999999995s)]
*  else made their way to this country from another part of the world and made it their home and made [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj3gi49tRY&t=4622.24s)]
