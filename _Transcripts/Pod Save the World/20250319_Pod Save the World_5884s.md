Video Description: Tommy and Ben discuss Bibi Netanyahu restarting the war in Gaza as he creates a new domestic political crisis, why Trump's airstrikes against the Houthi rebels in Yemen are likely to fail, and the gutting of Voice of America. They also cover the latest in Trump's efforts to harness the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged gang members to El Salvador, how Putin continues to play Trump in negotiations over Ukraine, Serbia's wave of student-led protests over government corruption, and why patrons at a popular Chinese hotpot chain are getting more than just a full refund. Then Ben speaks with Pankaj Mishra, author of The World After Gaza: A History, about how Israel's relationship with the legacy of the Holocaust has shifted, decolonization in the 20th century, and how a writer can be of service in these dark times.

*  There's lots of things happening in the world one of those weeks where we could have done two hours [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=156.16000000000003s)]
*  Yes, unfortunately, um today we're gonna explain why israel's resumed bombing in gaza and how netanyahu has created yet another domestic political crisis [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=159.68s)]
*  In his efforts to evade accountability for october 7th. We're going to talk about the trump administration following [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=168.4s)]
*  Uh president biden's lead once again in bombing the houthi rebels in yemen [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=174.24s)]
*  We'll cover the impact of doge gang gutting the voice of america and some new reporting about the impact of usaid cuts [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  And then trump just got off the phone with vladimir putin will fill you in on how it went [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=185.84s)]
*  And tell you if there's any progress towards peace in ukraine [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=190.24s)]
*  And then we're going to talk about why there is a massive protest movement in serbia [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=192.4s)]
*  And why a restaurant chain in china is going to have to cut a big check to customers [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=196.0s)]
*  For an unfortunate reason and then ben you did our interview earlier today. What'd you talk about? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=200.48s)]
*  Yeah, I talked to uh pankaj mishra who is a really extraordinary writer and thinker [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=203.92s)]
*  He has a book out now called the world after gaza [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  And so we talked about the resumption of the war in gaza. Uh, we talked about [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=212.64s)]
*  Um the different flavors of anti-semitism in the world today [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=217.92s)]
*  Obviously the focus on hamas and kind of campus anti-semitism, but also the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=222.0s)]
*  Ethnonationalism and far-right anti-semitism that seems to get less attention [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=227.26s)]
*  we talked about [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=231.04s)]
*  The kind of synergies between netanyahu and the israeli right and some of the other right-wing movements around the world like the hindu [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=232.8s)]
*  Nationalists in india a lot of that today's episode unfortunately a lot of ethnonationalists in today's episode [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=239.66s)]
*  We and we we talked also about like the global south perspective on not just israel gaza, but [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=244.96s)]
*  Everything that's happening in the world [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=251.28s)]
*  Whether or not there's ideas coming from within the global south that might help us [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=253.36s)]
*  Find the next global order so pretty wide-ranging conversation. We've talked about the role of the writer in this world today [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=257.92s)]
*  So it was like, you know put on your thinking caps and uh stick around for it is really smart conversation [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=263.92s)]
*  Definitely excited to listen to that. It must be weird to write a book called [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=269.12s)]
*  Uh the world after gaza and then have the war flare up. Yeah [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=272.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I shouldn't be laughing but I mean essentially [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=275.76s)]
*  Um, that was my first question, you know, um, so we are not after gaza. Yeah, no, unfortunately [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=278.15999999999997s)]
*  So let's start with that. I mean some terrible news overnight [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=283.28s)]
*  Which is that israel broke the gaza ceasefire and launched this massive series of airstrikes on the gaza strip that reportedly killed [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=285.84s)]
*  At least 400 people and wounded hundreds more. I think I saw estimates of over 500 wounded [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=291.92s)]
*  Hamas said that at least five senior officials in the organization were killed as were many children and innocent people [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=297.12s)]
*  Uh israel said the strikes were in response to hamas's intransigence during the ceasefire extension talks [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=302.88s)]
*  Ben it's it's hard not to notice that these strikes also come as netanyahu is in the midst of a domestic political crisis [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=308.23999999999995s)]
*  Thanks to him trying to fire the head of the shin bet their domestic intelligence service [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=314.79999999999995s)]
*  But we'll get that get to that in a second. Um with respect to the peace talks themselves though [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=318.64s)]
*  Israel wanted a seven-week extension of the ceasefire in exchange for hamas releasing half of the living hostages [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=323.44s)]
*  In the remains of half of the dead hostages still in gaza [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=330.32s)]
*  The hamas position was no let's work on phase two of the original agreement [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=334.0s)]
*  We all signed which would have led to a permanent end to the war [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=338.15999999999997s)]
*  But as we've discussed many times netanyahu does not actually want to end the war because he will get attacked from the right wing [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=341.68s)]
*  Of his political coalition and the israeli position is also basically that hamas must not have any power going forward [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=346.32s)]
*  Which is understandable after october 7th, but also clearly kind of a hard pill for hamas to swallow [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=352.15999999999997s)]
*  So, you know that's leads us to this moment [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=358.15999999999997s)]
*  In the first phase of the ceasefire hamas released 25 living prisoners in the remains of eight hostages while israel released 1500 palestinians [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=361.12s)]
*  They had in captivity. Um, so ben this is [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=367.92s)]
*  We're the really tough part of the talks right because of course you could understand each side's position [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=371.28s)]
*  Israel wants to permanently eradicate the threat of a hamas attack [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=375.36s)]
*  Uh hamas wants to continue to exist as a political organization [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=379.2s)]
*  But also as a military wing and they want the idf out of gaza [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=382.4s)]
*  I guess where I lose my kind of empathy for the israeli position is the idea that resuming the bombing campaign is going to [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=386.15999999999997s)]
*  Do much besides lead to the deaths of innocent people and the remaining hostages, but I don't know. How are you analyzing? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=393.84s)]
*  uh [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=401.03999999999996s)]
*  Netanyahu's move over the weekend. Well, you summed up what happened in terms of the breakdown of talks well in the sense that [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=401.84s)]
*  technically hamas was just [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=408.4s)]
*  Sticking to the original agreement, which is that there was this phase one [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=410.88s)]
*  And then you move to phase two and the additional hostage releases are tied to making agreements in phase two [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=414.32s)]
*  Which is about kind of the end of the war israel wanted to just extend phase one and [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=420.47999999999996s)]
*  You know make more exchanges, uh within that framework [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=426.47999999999996s)]
*  And and those we've talked about this a lot. I mean essentially [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=429.84s)]
*  the real rubber hits the road because [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=434.4s)]
*  Hamas once the end of the war and israel doesn't and you can't really move to the next phase [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=436.96000000000004s)]
*  Unless you're willing to entertain the end of the war and israel is not willing to do that [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=442.08000000000004s)]
*  Obviously there's a inherent tension between israel having a continued objective of [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=447.44s)]
*  Essentially destroying hamas and hamas having to agree to this. So I don't know how you ever [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=452.0s)]
*  Cross that bridge unless you're willing to entertain hamas [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=458.0s)]
*  Continuing in some fashion inside of guys which they're going to probably do anyway because there's a lot of support from us [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=462.47999999999996s)]
*  um [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=469.28s)]
*  They a couple of things i'd add to it in terms of the israeli political context you mentioned [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=470.15999999999997s)]
*  The kind of uproar over him firing the head of shin bet something has not happened before [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=475.03999999999996s)]
*  Um because of investigations ever in israel history ever in israeli history. So this is not normal [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=479.36s)]
*  But also, um, the israeli government is supposed to pass a budget [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=483.91999999999996s)]
*  By the end of the month and if they don't that's one of the things that can kind of trigger the collapse of the government [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=487.36s)]
*  There's a lot of reasons that bb needs to kind of return to his [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=491.36s)]
*  tried and true card of like playing to his own far right and resuming [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=495.52s)]
*  Bombing is a way to do that as ghoulish as that may be and you know the way in which this was broken [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=500.32s)]
*  You know in the middle of the night bombing campaigns literally violating the the ceasefire [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=506.64s)]
*  um [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=511.76s)]
*  You know just I [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=513.04s)]
*  Obviously we are sympathetic to the idea that there is inside of israel [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=515.2s)]
*  A great degree of fear or opposition to hamas [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=520.24s)]
*  Being in charge in gaza at the same time [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=524.64s)]
*  There is no way shape or form in which there's any risk whatsoever of another october 7th happening tomorrow [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=526.88s)]
*  Like these these strikes did not end some threat that was facing israelis. This is punitive. This is [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=532.88s)]
*  obviously causing huge civilian harm and [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=540.56s)]
*  And there's no clear end game other than just more war more suffering for the people of gaza [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=543.92s)]
*  The last thing i want to say to him is that keep in mind this comes on top of [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=548.4000000000001s)]
*  Weeks now where we've had a complete cut off of food and aid getting into gaza [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=552.08s)]
*  Electricity so this is not happening even in a vacuum. It's happening in terms of an already worsening humanitarian situation [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=557.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and we should just be clear that you know [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=562.8000000000001s)]
*  This is a decision made by the israeli government that is not backed by the israeli people [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=565.44s)]
*  I mean [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=569.5200000000001s)]
*  There's some reason polling the funds 70% of israelis want the ceasefire and hostage talks to continue even if it means israel releasing [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=569.6800000000001s)]
*  Terrorists and having to end the war permanently [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=577.44s)]
*  So it meant yahoo is just way off sides with the people he's ostensibly governing including yard and b-boss [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=579.44s)]
*  We've talked about the b-boss family before this was the entire family that was kidnapped [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=585.76s)]
*  Yarden b-boss's wife and two little children were murdered by hamas or died in the gaza strip [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=589.6s)]
*  Uh, i'm gonna say they were murdered because if you take children hostage you are responsible for their life and if they die it's on you [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=595.0400000000001s)]
*  He put he posted on facebook. We must stop the fighting and bring everyone home [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=600.88s)]
*  So there's this groundswell of support for continuing these negotiations getting the rest of these hostages home [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=605.12s)]
*  I think less than less than half of the 59 hostages [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=610.24s)]
*  Still in gaza are alive [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=613.68s)]
*  But unfortunately, you know, once again the united states president president trump has enabled the continuation of this war [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=616.08s)]
*  I think we've shipped over what like eight or twelve billion dollars worth of weapons [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=622.32s)]
*  Yeah to the israelis and interestingly then I mean there's a trump official who had done some direct talks with hamas this guy adam bowler [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=625.68s)]
*  Who had been nominated for this, you know senate confirmed [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=631.76s)]
*  Uh hostage negotiations or a released job. He seems to have been demoted or his position changed to some sort of special government employee [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=635.76s)]
*  um [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=643.76s)]
*  That is no longer a senate. Are you confusing him with uh rubio? No [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=644.8s)]
*  Oh the secretary sort of secretary. Yeah. Yeah. No. Yeah, so it's it's it's confusing [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=648.9599999999999s)]
*  I mean it just it's it seems like there's a critical mass of things showing [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=654.2399999999999s)]
*  Uh diplomacy kind of petering out here [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=657.92s)]
*  Yeah, it feels like there was this push by trump and and and steve witkopf his envoy to get a ceasefire in place right around [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=660.5600000000001s)]
*  His inauguration because they wanted the on optic of him coming in and things getting better [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=666.88s)]
*  Obviously they wanted some hostage releases, but they never really seemed that committed [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=671.44s)]
*  To actually ending the war and they certainly didn't seem committed to addressing the underlying [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=676.24s)]
*  Question, I mean witkopf said something about two-state solution, but nobody's talking about that right now. I mean, so I think the questions going forward are [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=680.8000000000001s)]
*  Does this bombardment continue? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=687.5200000000001s)]
*  Do the aid cutoff continue that alone is enough to bring massive suffering on the palestinians? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=689.68s)]
*  Do you see in the context of that bombardment trump start to talk about? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=694.72s)]
*  You know ethnically cleansing the gaza strip again trying to move them into egypt or jordan [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=700.0799999999999s)]
*  There's some noise about trying to find african countries. I know the palestinians too. That was a little worrying [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=704.56s)]
*  There's a question of whether there's a ground invasion which netanyahu I think would probably want trump sign off on it [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=709.84s)]
*  He didn't care what joe biden thought but with trump he probably wants to make sure that trump's on side with that [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=715.84s)]
*  But I think what this indicates is that gaza is just this kind of open-ended [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=721.28s)]
*  I don't want to call it a war because hamas isn't really fighting [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=727.1999999999999s)]
*  Let's be clear. They've responded to this bombardment. I mean at some point i'm sure they'll fire some rockets [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=730.3199999999999s)]
*  But there's this kind of ongoing bombardment of gaza. It's just going to be open-ended [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=734.64s)]
*  maybe stop and start and [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=739.36s)]
*  Actually negotiating some kind of end to this [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=741.92s)]
*  It seems to have been de-prioritized. Yeah, and you mentioned it happened during ramadan and like 2 30 in the morning [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=745.36s)]
*  So it's terrifying for civilians [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=750.56s)]
*  The political crisis that I referred to was bb trying to fire ronan bar the head of the shin bet [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=752.88s)]
*  So this announcement happened suddenly on sunday. It's the latest example of netanyahu [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=758.24s)]
*  Demanding accountability from everyone but himself for october 7th. So, you know, they pushed out the defense minister [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=762.96s)]
*  They pushed out the idf chief of staff [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=767.92s)]
*  The the shin bet has launched [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=770.4s)]
*  Also, we should just point out the shin bet has launched a bunch of investigations into netanyahu's staff including allegations [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=772.7199999999999s)]
*  That the qatari government paid money to some of netanyahu's top aides seems relevant here [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=778.16s)]
*  They're also looking into the leak of sensitive intelligence documents to a german newspaper [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=782.9599999999999s)]
*  Which netanyahu then used to uh as like a pretext to blow up the the hostage talks [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=787.28s)]
*  We talked about that at the time was to build this german outlet [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=792.4s)]
*  On top of all that though then the shin bet has publicized a summary of its own failures in preventing october 7th [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=795.5999999999999s)]
*  Which talked about like their internal mistakes [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=801.5999999999999s)]
*  Uh that not taking seriously enough intelligence about hamas planning to attack southern israel [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=804.24s)]
*  But they also pointed the finger at political decisions by the netanyahu government for letting hamas getting funding from qatar [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=809.76s)]
*  For failing to target hamas's leadership and then just sort of like general chaos [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=817.1999999999999s)]
*  Around the netanyahu's political moves during the judicial coup that we talked about a bunch that just made israel look weak and divided basically [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=821.2s)]
*  You know, they're talking about how the netanyahu government's policy was contain hamas hamas [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=829.12s)]
*  Kind of prop them up in some sense to keep the palestinian movement divided and weaken the palestinian authority that obviously ended [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=834.4s)]
*  catastrophically for everyone involved [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=841.74s)]
*  Um, but instead of accountability for netanyahu [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=843.6s)]
*  What seems to be happening is he is consolidating power by pushing out other leaders in government [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=846.5s)]
*  Even though a recent poll found that 70 of the country wants him to resign [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=851.54s)]
*  Uh, however instead we're talking going back to these same tactics [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=855.3000000000001s)]
*  And you know kind of pushing out other people in other power centers and consolidating so on wednesday the day this episode comes out [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=859.22s)]
*  The cabinet will vote on ronin bar's dismissal [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=866.9s)]
*  The attorney general the israeli attorney general said bb can't fire ronin bar unless it goes through a process to determine [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=869.62s)]
*  whether [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=875.6199999999999s)]
*  Doing so is lawful. We'll see if you know netanyahu goes along with that ruling from the ag or else [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=876.66s)]
*  We might have a constitutional crisis brewing [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=882.02s)]
*  but [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=884.02s)]
*  I mean bed. What did what did you make of this? I mean it's for us now [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=884.9799999999999s)]
*  It's pretty familiar to see like uh unpopular right wing kind of autocrats driving countries into a ditch, but this feels um [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=888.0999999999999s)]
*  Feels like a real escalation to me and memory holding their own [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=895.38s)]
*  crimes or [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=898.8199999999999s)]
*  With nanyahu's case there's a lot to look at there's literal crimes and then there's him doing everything he can to memory hole his own [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=900.42s)]
*  Massive and glaring failures around october 7, you know, why was the idf up in the west bank chasing around? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=907.4599999999999s)]
*  Settlers to commit violence against palestinians instead of guarding that border, you know, why was all this money essentially [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=914.0s)]
*  Used to prop up hamas with nanyahu himself telling members of the lecrute party. We want hamas [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=921.78s)]
*  It's a justification for their never being a palestinian state [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=927.62s)]
*  It's a justification for keeping the palestinian leadership separated [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=930.02s)]
*  You know, those are things that he wants to just kind of literally sweep under the rug [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=933.14s)]
*  And I think part of what is so concerning here is he has learned the lesson of the last, you know year and a half [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=936.74s)]
*  That perpetuating this war is a way to constantly keep the political pressure off of himself [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=944.18s)]
*  And to kind of placate the far right that once kind of an open-ended can brutalist israeli policy [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=949.86s)]
*  Right now tommy we are looking at the bombardment of gaza resuming [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=955.7s)]
*  Israel continues to be in southern syria [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=960.74s)]
*  Where they've done all kinds of they've taken land. They've bombed targets [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=963.46s)]
*  They are making threats about the iranian nuclear program. So there's a potential front there [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=967.3000000000001s)]
*  Obviously in lebanon, there's a tenuous ceasefire on that border. We're talking like multiple countries where nanyahu has this capacity to [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=972.1s)]
*  Turn the dial up or down [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=980.02s)]
*  And every time he feels political pressure, he seems to turn the dial up and that's not some conspiracy [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=982.02s)]
*  That's literally what's happened the last, you know, whenever he feels politically cornered [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=987.22s)]
*  Something is you know going to get hotter somewhere else right now. Nobody's even fighting back, right? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=992.1s)]
*  You know hamas isn't fighting back the syrians aren't fighting back. There's a you know ceasefire in lebanon [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=996.82s)]
*  The iranians are trying to get into nuclear talks, right? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1001.86s)]
*  Um, and and it's only the houthis which we'll talk about except the houthis. Yeah, which we're [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1005.22s)]
*  Teaming this up for the transition. But the reality is [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1009.38s)]
*  like [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1012.58s)]
*  There are more places including iran where this could escalate further the more the you know, the political pressure builds on him [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1013.46s)]
*  The more you might expect to see him or the west bank for that matter the more you might expect to see him do dramatic things [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1020.82s)]
*  To kind of get the attention off of his own political fortunes and he's also I mean the man has [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1026.8200000000002s)]
*  Fought an independent review of october 7th. What has happened is independent [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1031.94s)]
*  Components of the israeli like security state have done their own [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1036.88s)]
*  Investigation and reviews into their own conduct, but he has just evaded any real accountability by you know, a sort of 911 [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1040.96s)]
*  Commission style look back at how october 7th. It's it's I mean, it's probably why he's at a 70% disapproval rating [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1048.74s)]
*  But it's just infuriating. Yeah, but not surprising not at all surprising. Um, okay, so [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1055.6200000000001s)]
*  Ben, uh sort of in the neighborhood. Let's check in on our own anti-war president. Yes, donald trump [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1061.0600000000002s)]
*  So over the weekend trump the trump administration [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1065.78s)]
*  Launched a major series of airstrikes on hufii rebel targets in yemen, which local authorities say killed 53 people and injured nearly [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1068.74s)]
*  A hundred more those strikes included targets in the capital of sana [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1075.78s)]
*  This came after the hufis threatened to resume attacks on ships in the red sea [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1080.1000000000001s)]
*  They did not actually resume attacks on ships in the red sea [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1083.78s)]
*  But you have to imagine there was some intelligence that the trump people were preempting was I think that's been reported [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1086.66s)]
*  Um the hufis say these attacks on ships in the red sea are in response to israel cutting off humanitarian support into gaza [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1092.42s)]
*  And if you go back further, which we will you know, the whole pretext around these firing missiles at red sea ships [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1099.38s)]
*  Was around the gaza war this came after the hufis threatened to resume attacks on ships in the red sea [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1105.46s)]
*  Which they say are in response most recently to israel cutting off humanitarian support into gaza [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1110.74s)]
*  Listeners probably remember that back in november of 2023 the hufis started attacking ships in the red sea including u.s [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1116.02s)]
*  warships calling this an act of solidarity with gaza [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1122.74s)]
*  So at the time the biden administration retaliated against the hufis with strikes on hufii targets [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1125.86s)]
*  Most of which were designed to destroy military infrastructure in anti-ship missiles, but trump may have started something bigger here [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1131.7s)]
*  Here's a clip of marco rubio [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1139.94s)]
*  Discussing their plans on cbs news over the weekend, but this is not a message [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1141.94s)]
*  This is not a one-off. This is an effort to deny them the ability to continue to constrict and control shipping [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1146.66s)]
*  And it's just not going to happen [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1153.94s)]
*  We're not going to have these guys these people with weapons able to tell us where our ships can go where the ships of all [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1155.78s)]
*  The world can go by the way. It's not just the u.s [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1161.54s)]
*  We're doing the world a favor [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1163.3s)]
*  We're doing the entire world a favor by getting rid of these guys and their ability to strike global shipping [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1164.9s)]
*  That's the mission here and it will continue until that's carried out that never happened before the biden administration didn't do that [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1169.78s)]
*  All the biden administration would do is they would respond to an attack these guys would launch one rocket. We'd hit the rocket launcher [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1176.02s)]
*  That's it. This is an effort to take away their ability to control global shipping in that part of the world [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1181.54s)]
*  That's just not going to happen anymore. So we're doing the world a favor by getting rid of these guys sounded a little [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1186.98s)]
*  Regime changey to me been but then I also noticed pete hexath secretary of defense [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1192.3400000000001s)]
*  Said the bombing campaigning at the hooties will end if the hooties stop shooting at u.s ships [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1196.74s)]
*  So that is clearly more limited but hexeth also said quote [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1201.6200000000001s)]
*  We don't care what happens in the umeni civil war, which is very nice of him [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1204.98s)]
*  So ben, what do you make of this? Uh old but new war from our anti-war president. Are we back in regime change mode? [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1209.22s)]
*  Or is this more limited? I mean first of all marco rubio [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1216.42s)]
*  Despite his very best efforts [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1221.54s)]
*  Sounds like the least tough person on the face of the earth [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1224.5s)]
*  You know, you can tell he kind of rehearsed this in the mirror [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1229.3s)]
*  And he wanted to sound like a tough guy and he wanted to say things like these guys a bunch of times [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1233.06s)]
*  And he literally just sounds like the kind of kid [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1238.42s)]
*  What he that voice doesn't sound like someone threatening hooties [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1242.5s)]
*  It sounds like a kid who ran in from the school yard to tell the teacher on somebody else or something [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1245.54s)]
*  These guys are trying to mess up international shipping, you know, like she's careless with his word choices [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1250.4199999999998s)]
*  I just don't get it. But anyway, put put uh general rubio aside for a second here [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1254.5s)]
*  The thing that worries me about this is I look [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1260.02s)]
*  The biden policy wasn't the clearest policy in the world [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1263.06s)]
*  There was every now and then we'd just go bomb a bunch of the hooties in their infrastructure [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1265.3s)]
*  but part of what is like troubling to me is that [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1269.6999999999998s)]
*  The messaging from trump on down to rubio [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1272.74s)]
*  And you know, because you know rubio is on whatever messages he's been commanded to deliver [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1275.7s)]
*  so [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1280.34s)]
*  He has to take that shot at biden, you know [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1281.3s)]
*  It just seems to be informed by like our strikes on the hooties are going to be a little bit bigger than joe biden [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1283.94s)]
*  So we can say that they're bigger, you know [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1288.82s)]
*  And there's not really any logic if you if you unpack what he said because the hooties have you know [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1291.06s)]
*  They kind of stop shooting at ships and then they do this is not a new thing kind of stop and start from them [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1296.74s)]
*  They've tied it to the resumption of hostilities in gaza [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1301.78s)]
*  um [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1304.74s)]
*  There's no indication that one round of airstrikes is going to like make the hooties go away or change their fundamental calculus [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1305.38s)]
*  I was talking to an expert today who said he thinks that trump was almost certainly told by like sent com or some of his [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1311.94s)]
*  military advisors that all we need to do sir is take the gloves off stir and stop caring about civilian casualties and get [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1316.98s)]
*  rid of these biden restrictions, sir [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1323.0600000000002s)]
*  And then we'll take these guys out and it's just [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1325.14s)]
*  Bullshit. Yeah, like they might be attacking leaders. They might have found intel on leaders [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1327.8600000000001s)]
*  There seem like they're hitting warehouses or other targets in cities [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1331.22s)]
*  But they're I just don't think that they're going to make a material difference here [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1333.8600000000001s)]
*  And I think I think what happened to tommy you're right and like i'm talking to some people it seems like [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1337.6200000000001s)]
*  There were some people at sent com that wanted the more maximalist option that did include for instance [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1344.42s)]
*  Trying to hit individual hootie leaders [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1351.06s)]
*  Like you said and sometimes you actually don't have good intel on where those guys are [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1353.94s)]
*  Sometimes you might but like you might kill a whole bunch of civilians in doing that and they went mr [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1357.94s)]
*  Trump sir. Joe biden was afraid to take out these guys, but the reality is that the hooties [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1362.82s)]
*  Are are people that live in yemen like they're not even analogous to isis with the last time trump wanted to prove [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1367.6200000000001s)]
*  He was tougher than someone basically just took the same obama plan and loosened some restrictions on civilian casualties [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1372.82s)]
*  Which I think is not a good thing [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1378.1000000000001s)]
*  But the isis was foreign fighters, right? [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1379.7s)]
*  They're not going to go away in yemen unless you you know go commit a genocide or something like they're they're people that live there and [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1382.42s)]
*  And so I don't really think if anything worries me about this [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1389.78s)]
*  it's [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1393.62s)]
*  Trump doing the opposite of what you know, he said about getting set of wars [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1394.98s)]
*  in a situation in which you have [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1399.62s)]
*  A war in gaza. Like I said, you've got syria like there's sectarian violence picking up there. The israelis are occupying southern syria [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1402.26s)]
*  Um, there are people stirring the pot there and the government can't really get its legs under it because there's sanctions [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1410.74s)]
*  Yemen you got an act of civil war and this hootie thing [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1416.9s)]
*  You've got the iranians like trying to avoid a war over their nuclear program [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1419.54s)]
*  But it's not clear whether there's a deal like this whole region could still if trump's impulses to continue to [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1423.54s)]
*  Show that he's tough by like saying yes to the most [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1430.42s)]
*  You know square jaw general that like calls him sir like we you know, this could be worse nickname exactly [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1433.54s)]
*  What they uh, who's our new chairman? I I forgot the nickname already nail bag. Yeah, yeah adam and mozal. Yeah [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1440.3400000000001s)]
*  Erasmus or something that was our guy [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1447.46s)]
*  Nick yeah [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1450.18s)]
*  I mean just to really like hammer home the point you're making about the who's these living in yemen [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1450.5800000000002s)]
*  They they are they're a tribal group from northern yemen tribe [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1454.74s)]
*  You know, yeah [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1458.3400000000001s)]
*  They practice the form of shia islam and like the hootie movement emerged in the 90s in part in opposition to like saudi influence [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1458.8200000000002s)]
*  And hardline saudi religious practices [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1465.54s)]
*  But then they came on to like the international community's radar in a big way in 2014 [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1467.8600000000001s)]
*  When they seized the capital of yemen when they forced the yemeni president, uh at the time to run for his life by 2015 [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1471.46s)]
*  The hooties controlled a big chunk of yemen's territory [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1476.9s)]
*  And in 2015 the saudis decided to launch this major military operation to dislodge them [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1480.82s)]
*  And that proved to be a catastrophic failure on a military and a humanitarian level [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1486.42s)]
*  It led to hundreds of thousands of yemenis dying either in the fighting [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1491.06s)]
*  And or from the famine and by 2022 the saudis were like, all right, we're good on bombing [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1495.3000000000002s)]
*  we're going to try to cut a deal and [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1500.5s)]
*  You know, I think everything was reawakened by october 7th now [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1503.94s)]
*  Like everyone points out that the hooties get a lot of support from iran. That is true [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1507.5400000000002s)]
*  Um, it's also I think important to say then that like there are some quarters of the left that embrace the hootie rebels [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1512.9s)]
*  because they were seen as [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1518.98s)]
*  Doing something to end the war in gaza, but we should say these are not good guys [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1520.9s)]
*  They are authoritarian [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1526.26s)]
*  They have kidnapped and killed, uh aid workers. They've terrorized the population like no one should cheer for them [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1527.8600000000001s)]
*  but [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1535.7s)]
*  Back to the military campaign then I mean I this expert I was talking to and other people who left the biden administration [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1536.5800000000002s)]
*  Have said the same thing to me, which is that by the end of their hootie military campaign [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1541.7s)]
*  They realized that like you can't deter these guys [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1546.74s)]
*  Yeah, like you can you can degrade them you can take away some of their capabilities [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1549.78s)]
*  Yes, you can degrade them. You can set up like defensive infrastructure in the red sea. You can like create a [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1553.7s)]
*  missile defense wall around israel, but like really [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1559.06s)]
*  Dismantling them is a years-long project with way better intelligence some sort of ground campaign [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1562.48s)]
*  Like it's a disaster the saudis and the amirates have fought a war for nearly a decade against these guys [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1567.94s)]
*  With plenty of u.s [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1574.18s)]
*  Support and they were somehow stronger at the end of that process than they were at the beginning [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1575.38s)]
*  And also trump and this is why the iran part worries me in his like truth socialing [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1580.0200000000002s)]
*  Which is I guess where we announced military operations now. He was like this is a message for iran all caps or something, right? And [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1585.46s)]
*  The iranians do not control the hooties. They it's a very important. This is so important like [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1593.38s)]
*  This is actually not like hezbollah or something. They do give them some weapons and they have [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1597.8600000000001s)]
*  And maybe they could stop doing that I don't think that would impact the hooties behavior that much, you know [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1602.18s)]
*  They they they do their own thing these guys, you know [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1608.02s)]
*  And and what is trump exactly saying in certain the message to iran the message that we're gonna bomb you next [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1610.82s)]
*  I mean this whole thing could get could go sideways pretty fast and and and let's also point out [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1616.5s)]
*  Whether we're talking about gaza or yemen or wherever [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1622.82s)]
*  Uh, we used to think about what we're doing to obviously civilians from a humanitarian perspective [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1626.8200000000002s)]
*  Also from like a just multi-decade anti-american sentiment radicalization perspective [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1632.26s)]
*  Like this kind of the casual nature of of these pretty large-scale bombing [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1637.22s)]
*  I mean these aren't even these are not like drone strikes and people should give us plenty of shit about those, too [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1642.1000000000001s)]
*  But this is like, you know, we're dropping huge ordinance on multiple countries or we're giving israel to ordinance to do that [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1647.22s)]
*  And I just I don't know. I don't like where this is probably headed for the middle east, you know [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1654.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that that tweet from trump blaming iran saying you're responsible for anything the hooties do they're not they're just not yeah [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1659.06s)]
*  Apparently the hooties the pentagon says the hooties have fired 174 [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1666.26s)]
*  projectiles at u.s [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1670.32s)]
*  Navy ships since 2023 and like 150 more at commercial ships [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1671.46s)]
*  So they've been firing off a lot of stuff and if we're holding iran responsible for all of that [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1674.98s)]
*  Uh, that's a problem because to your point [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1679.38s)]
*  I mean they have a hooties have a high degree of autonomy and this person was this hootie expert was telling me that after the [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1681.78s)]
*  solomani assassination [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1688.1s)]
*  That kind of strategy of more distributed authority and autonomy to their kind of so-called proxy forces [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1689.94s)]
*  Has seems to have been a policy because it allows them not to have to like have such close ties or create, you know [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1696.66s)]
*  Intelligence channels that can be intercepted etc [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1703.1399999999999s)]
*  But it is also allowed for a lot of proliferation of missile and drone technology [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1705.54s)]
*  Like there's some concern that the hooties could be sharing this stuff with al-qaeda or al-shabaab [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1710.26s)]
*  And that's what I mean about terrorism coming our way. Yeah, because if you start to really go after these guys [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1715.14s)]
*  Um, you know, they're not going to surrender and and this this imagine trump after a terrorist attack [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1720.1000000000001s)]
*  Oh, I just this none of this makes me feel good [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1725.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and then just in terms of yemen itself like there's not [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1728.98s)]
*  A lot of good options to deal with the youth with these right now [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1732.02s)]
*  But the current plan if we just sum it all up is [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1734.9s)]
*  israel resuming the war in gaza with [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1738.58s)]
*  You know eight or twelve billion dollars worth of additional u.s [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1741.38s)]
*  weapons trump gutting usaid and cutting off parts of yemen to humanitarian support and now we're bombing the shit out of yemen again [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1744.66s)]
*  Uh, and that's just like that is catastrophic to the point where even the saudis are like [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1752.26s)]
*  Do not do this like we went down this path the saudis are saying that you know [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1756.82s)]
*  And the usaid point's really important because in the kind of you know, pretty dark [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1760.4199999999998s)]
*  contradictory reality of american foreign policy [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1765.76s)]
*  USAID was a huge donor to addressing humanitarian needs in yemen and now that's gone [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1768.9599999999998s)]
*  So a lot more people are going to suffer [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1774.5s)]
*  Than even suffered in past bombing campaigns. Yeah, it won't be the houthis who I think represent like 15 of the population [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1776.5s)]
*  It'll be women and kids and civilians who always get hurt. Yeah, who will blame america will blame america [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1782.26s)]
*  Ben speaking of kind of the gutting of u.s power abroad including soft power. Let's talk about the voice of america [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1789.1399999999999s)]
*  Um voice of america or voa was founded in 1942 during world war two to be counterweight to nazi propaganda [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1795.6999999999998s)]
*  The idea was to provide news and information and cultural programs to audiences literally around the world while also promoting american [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1801.9399999999998s)]
*  Values like press freedom democracy, etc after world war two ended voa's mission evolved into a tool to combat communism in the soviet union [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1809.22s)]
*  More recently that mission evolved further. They are doing programming in the middle east asia [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1818.0200000000002s)]
*  There's combating extremism china iran, etc, right? So [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1823.6200000000001s)]
*  That was until friday last week trump released an executive order targeting voa's parent organization [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1828.3400000000001s)]
*  The u.s agency for global media which also funds other u.s-backed news outlets like radio for europe radio for asia, etc [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1835.46s)]
*  Combined these outlets reach 420 million people in 100 countries in broadcast in 63 languages [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1842.66s)]
*  the impact of this eo is that [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1849.3s)]
*  Nearly all of voa's 1300 staff members have been put on paid leave their programming is gone [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1852.5800000000002s)]
*  It's been replaced by like musak or you know dead air or whatever [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1857.46s)]
*  Trump has installed the failed arizona senate and gubernatorial candidate kerry lake to run voa [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1861.46s)]
*  Basically with the mission to destroy it. Um, ben, do you want to talk about? [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1867.6200000000001s)]
*  The mission of voa and the impact of these news services [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1871.7s)]
*  Being eviscerated. Yeah [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1875.8600000000001s)]
*  So the numbers begin to tell a story over 400 million people in over 60 languages [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1877.6200000000001s)]
*  um [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1883.7s)]
*  And I think what people have to realize is think of voa is something like a wire service largely [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1884.74s)]
*  Like it's pretty straight news to the point that we actually used to get shit [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1889.7s)]
*  Like why aren't you doing your own propaganda like rt is so much better at propagandizing [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1893.6200000000001s)]
*  But part of the idea behind it is a lot of the places sure we can focus on the places where [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1897.88s)]
*  You know, we're trying to get information into like the iranian people [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1904.5200000000002s)]
*  Um or places where there's geopolitical tension a lot of these are places where there's no other [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1908.0400000000002s)]
*  Access to straight news to knowing what the fuck is going on, you know [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1913.8000000000002s)]
*  That's why you do in all these languages and and if you think that that seems like a luxury [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1917.72s)]
*  Consider the fact that we're living in a world in which people are constantly bombarded on social media or through various propaganda channels [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1922.76s)]
*  With garbage, you know and people trust more important than ever [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1930.44s)]
*  Yeah, I know people in southeast asia for instance who are living in pretty tough places but in yanmar [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1933.3999999999999s)]
*  Cambodia places where you you have civil conflict or you've got dictators who put out all kinds of disinformation all the time [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1939.1399999999999s)]
*  Or misinformation and people could trust [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1945.3999999999999s)]
*  Voa product or radio free asia product, right if you remove that not only is that just denying [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1948.0400000000002s)]
*  You know credible news source to people it is opening the door for people to be further radicalized or brainwashed essentially through disinformation [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1954.8400000000001s)]
*  You know, it's just literally pulling the plug on on hundreds of millions of people that rely on this information [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1963.0s)]
*  And and I think what I find so kind of grotesque about this to take a step back [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1968.52s)]
*  is [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1973.0s)]
*  To connect what we were just talking about [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1974.2800000000002s)]
*  America first, right a lot of us had to be like well I can see some of the points trump's making, you know [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1976.44s)]
*  but this is [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1982.68s)]
*  He was talking about like the credible version of america first is [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1984.28s)]
*  The forever war we fought 20 years of fucking dumb wars in the middle east [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1988.6s)]
*  And we killed hundreds of thousands of people and thousands of our own people died and we spent all this money [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1992.76s)]
*  Let's not do that [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1996.6s)]
*  And and that's not what america first turned out to be we are still fighting the dumb fucking wars [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=1998.12s)]
*  We're still bombing people in yemen. We're still sending eight to twelve billion dollars of assistance israel to bomb people [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2003.24s)]
*  We're upping the defense budget. That's the only thing that went up in the recent thing that strumer capitulated to [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2009.56s)]
*  What are we cutting? We're cutting [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2015.96s)]
*  The the only good things america does in the world, you know, we're taking away usaid all soft power gone all of it [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2018.1200000000001s)]
*  Right, we're cutting all of usaid all pepfarb, which is, you know, obviously life-saving systems for hiv aids [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2024.44s)]
*  All of voice of america and its various cousins [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2029.88s)]
*  That is not the the america and the world sure people like grumble about foreign aid [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2034.2s)]
*  But I don't think that's what people were were upset about in terms of the excesses of the deep state or whatever you want to call it [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2038.52s)]
*  um, and so that's what is so disgusting about what we're watching is like [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2044.52s)]
*  We're seeing the methodical destruction of anything good america might do in the world or anything that might improve people's lives around the world [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2048.6s)]
*  Or anything that might combat autocracy around the world and we're not seeing any diminution in if anything [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2055.32s)]
*  We're seeing ratcheting up of geopolitical tension with tariffs and military action and all the rest of it [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2061.4s)]
*  And before we started recording you and I were talking about how deputy assistant secretary rubio used to really care about a certain component [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2066.36s)]
*  Of voa. Yes. Well, this is what drives me fucking nuts about marco rubio's [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2072.84s)]
*  I used to get I had this argument with him because we one of the one of the bloated parts of uh, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2076.04s)]
*  Of this whole enterprise is something called radio marti, which has been broadcasting from basically south florida [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2080.92s)]
*  Where it supports a bunch of jobs by the way [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2087.7200000000003s)]
*  Um into cuba, right and and you know [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2089.72s)]
*  Seemed like a lot of money to be spending on something that wasn't really working cubans blocked it [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2093.16s)]
*  So so it was kind of like a radio station that hardliners and in florida [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2097.3999999999996s)]
*  So so rubio fights to the death if brock obama wants to cut one dollar [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2101.56s)]
*  But then rubio fucking shuts it all down when he's secretary of the state turning off the switch [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2105.9599999999996s)]
*  Like killing jobs in florida and just to connect some dots with marco rubio right now [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2110.4399999999996s)]
*  You've got venezuelans being flown into gulags in el salvador something that marco rubio would have once seemingly objected to I thought [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2114.84s)]
*  We wanted to help the venezuelan people we've got you know cubans are not allowed in this country anymore something that marco rubio used to [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2121.96s)]
*  Care about like all marco rubio used to complain about conditions in cuban prisons [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2127.0s)]
*  That fucking the the el salvadorian prisons make that look like you know a country club [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2131.64s)]
*  I mean, this is this is insane what what marco rubio is [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2136.2s)]
*  Is single-handedly proving how full of shit he was in in just two months potty the world is brought to you by helix [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2140.36s)]

*  We've uh in-laws [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2149.64s)]
*  Sister-in-law bunch of people here. So we're rotating people sort of through really we're coming out. Well that really oh [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2151.56s)]
*  I think meant like two different rooms [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2157.32s)]
*  No, like people are coming in staggered to staggered times and uh, everyone who sleeps on our guest room on the helix mattress says [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2158.76s)]
*  Best sleep of my life slept like a baby. Yeah, almost almost slept through breakfast [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2165.96s)]
*  In fact, so comfortable my mother-in-law was with us all week and she slept on a helix mattress and also lived it [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2169.88s)]
*  There you go. Look at all the in-laws [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2176.12s)]

*  But I don't it doesn't matter what the what the quiz said you seem like a don lux I was [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2187.16s)]
*  You know, it was a fantastic mattress. It is super comfortable. Everyone raves about it [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2191.08s)]
*  And it's just an easy way to figure out like the best fit for you [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2195.32s)]
*  The helix lineup offers 20 unique mattresses including the award-winning lux and ultra premium elite collections helix plus [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2198.04s)]

*  That's why they offer a 100 night trial and 10 to 15 year warranty to try out a new helix mattress [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2215.32s)]

*  Well, let's talk about um this immigration piece and then get to some of the usad parts too on the salvadorian part ben [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2235.96s)]
*  So on positive america, we spent a bunch of time digging into trump's most recent immigration moves [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2242.6s)]
*  I do think like taken together. They're horrifying and scary [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2246.28s)]
*  But I think the most relevant part of this for us is trump using this law from 1798 [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2249.0s)]
*  All the best laws are written then called the alien enemies act [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2254.04s)]
*  Which they're using to deport venezuelan men to el salvador to be held in prison there like literally any venezuelan male over 16 [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2256.68s)]
*  Can be declared a part of a gang and now shipped to el salvador [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2264.12s)]
*  At the moment these deportations are being blocked by the courts trump is furious about that [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2267.8s)]
*  He called the judge who halted the deportations a radical left lunatic and demanded that the guy be impeached [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2271.72s)]
*  That statement actually prompted a response from chief justice john roberts who was like hey bud [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2277.56s)]
*  Impeachment isn't how you deal with the ruling. You don't like uh, you try the try the appeals process, you know [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2282.52s)]
*  Like let's be an adult here, but ben, I mean this this is so scary [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2287.0s)]
*  It's scary on its face [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2291.72s)]
*  But it's also a scary precedent that could be expanded to other groups that donald trump does not like and to your point [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2292.6s)]
*  I mean it's worth reminding everyone just how bad el salvador's prison system is [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2298.2s)]
*  It there's a lot of components of this two percent of the population of the country is in prison [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2302.8399999999997s)]
*  Because nai bukele [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2307.16s)]
*  Has put in place a mass incarceration policy where he indiscriminately rounds people up and throws them in jail with no due process [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2308.7599999999998s)]
*  To your point I was talking to a human rights expert in el salvador a couple months ago [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2315.24s)]
*  Who said that prisoners in venezuela have more due process than prisoners in el salvador under this current system because [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2319.48s)]
*  Bukele declared this state of exception, which is there sort of it's like a state of emergency where he suspended due process rights [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2326.3599999999997s)]
*  Assessively to to deal with gang violence for like a month [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2333.08s)]
*  But then like every state of emergency it just gets extended over and over and over again [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2336.2s)]
*  And he's used it to sweep people up and indiscriminately throw men into prison [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2340.52s)]
*  And now the united states is going to help keep bukele in power by paying el salvador [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2344.3599999999997s)]
*  Money to house prisoners from the u.s [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2349.3999999999996s)]
*  With no due process and there was a point in time where conservatives like a marco rubio like a john mccain [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2351.48s)]
*  Cared deeply about human rights or at least they talked about it a lot, right and that is just [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2359.16s)]
*  I guess it's just gone. I mean rubio tweeted something [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2364.52s)]
*  About the wiegers the other day and it made me think about when credibility to see have to talk about that [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2367.48s)]
*  Yeah, I remember when trump john bolton trump's former national security advisor said in his book that trump not only did not care about [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2372.2s)]
*  Millions of wiegers being thrown into concentration camps. He told shijin ping that it was the right thing to do [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2380.12s)]
*  Yeah [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2385.4s)]
*  I mean we're literally subsidizing like one of the largest gulags if not the largest gulag in the world [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2386.28s)]
*  You know have to check it to don't no libel suits bukele [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2392.04s)]
*  But but it's a big fucking prison where terrible things happen to people. That's very clear [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2395.8s)]
*  I think one way to think about it too tommy is because you guys had a very good conversation on psa [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2399.64s)]
*  You know, I think a lot about this, you know [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2404.76s)]
*  Kind of authoritarian playbook that we're living through and I obviously wrote like my last book was about this [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2406.36s)]
*  We are you're ahead of the curve on that book unfortunately, yeah, you had the whole orban pruden trump comparison [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2412.28s)]
*  I didn't like that. That was kind of pressing. I know and and so as I think back on that [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2418.2000000000003s)]
*  What's scary about living through it now is in some ways we are so far [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2424.36s)]
*  Ahead of like orban has never approached this right like these people that we think of as dictators in their wildest dreams [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2429.56s)]
*  They could never think of like randomly deporting lots of people to prisons in third countries [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2437.2400000000002s)]
*  Because what we're seeing is yes trump is implementing a playbook ignore judges do whatever you want [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2442.6800000000003s)]
*  Install loyalists like we we all now unfortunately are familiar with that playbook [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2448.1200000000003s)]
*  But what's scary is when you're the president of the united states? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2452.6800000000003s)]
*  there's [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2457.56s)]
*  Things that are available to you that are not available to the bolsonaros and orbans and even deterritors of the world which are [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2458.36s)]
*  You can pressure [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2465.4s)]
*  Countries in latin america to take all these people and throw them into your prisons, right? [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2466.92s)]
*  And and and so we're seeing [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2471.4s)]
*  I think americans have to get their minds around like we are not, you know at the beginning of this [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2474.12s)]
*  We're kind of pretty late in the in the spectrum, which is like there's no constraint on him [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2477.96s)]
*  But we're also seeing how? [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2483.56s)]
*  Like trump for all of his railing against the deep state [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2485.88s)]
*  He's using the awesome powers of the american national security state [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2488.7599999999998s)]
*  For his authoritarian impulses. Yep, so he doesn't like he talks shit on the fbi [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2493.72s)]
*  He loves ice [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2499.16s)]
*  He loves those military planes that are flying people down there and he's posting like fascist snuff videos [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2500.6s)]
*  You know with them like and we're starting to see what it's like to have that u.s. National security apparatus [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2505.9599999999996s)]
*  Wedded to the authoritarian playbook and that's what I find scary about it [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2512.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's really scary that that point about his ability to force other countries to do things that no other dictator would be able to do [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2516.2799999999997s)]
*  And also the united states is usually the one calling out other countries and trying to at least to deter these kinds of human rights violations [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2522.36s)]
*  Oh, and we're gonna see that we're gonna see all kinds of copycat stuff happening around the world [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2528.92s)]
*  I mean you wait a few months to see the ripples of not only usaid being gone and voa being gone [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2532.6800000000003s)]
*  But seeing other people saying well, look what trump's doing like i'm gonna do whatever the fuck I want [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2539.4s)]
*  In fact, you're already seeing it right because once you know [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2544.04s)]
*  You have trump and elon musk and others in the government saying that like usaid is a corrupt [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2546.84s)]
*  You know organization designed to for regime change that gives every authoritarian around the world the pretext to raid [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2552.36s)]
*  Ngo's supported by usaid etc, right? Yeah, we'll get to that in a minute in serbia. So [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2559.46s)]
*  One last thing on this ben. We've been trying to keep everybody updated on the impact of trump gutting usaid [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2564.44s)]
*  Along those lines there was a really [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2569.6400000000003s)]
*  Uh, well done piece in the new york times by nick christoph over the weekend it had the headline [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2572.12s)]
*  Musk said no one has died since aid was cut. That isn't true highly recommend reading this he went to sudan south sudan [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2577.16s)]
*  Met with people who are going to die or know of children who died because usaid is gone [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2583.64s)]
*  The times also worked with the center for global development to estimate how many people at risk of dying within a year [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2589.3199999999997s)]
*  Uh, here's the stats that came up with [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2595.3199999999997s)]
*  1.65 million people could die without u.s. Help to fund hiv prevention and treatment [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2597.48s)]
*  Half a million could die without vaccine funding more than half a million could die without food from america [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2601.88s)]
*  Almost 300 000 could die without malaria prevention funding from the u.s [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2607.0s)]
*  310 000 could die without u.s funding for tuberculosis prevention. There's also this broader concern about [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2610.6600000000003s)]
*  Us helping reignite drug resistant tuberculosis strains all around the world. So that's great [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2616.6800000000003s)]
*  But um, look read the christoph piece [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2621.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, share the impact on social media like I don't think we have any hope of saving usaid at this point [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2623.96s)]
*  But I do think we need to make these monsters own the impact of what they're doing [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2628.92s)]
*  And the only thing i'll say about this is our ketamine adult white south african, uh deputy dictator [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2633.0s)]
*  Um, you know tweeted out something about how like he gets all this hate when he's never harmed a person in his life [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2639.32s)]

*  Elon musk is going to be responsible for the deaths of [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2652.1200000000003s)]
*  children of [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2655.8s)]
*  So many people I can't get my mind around it and there's gonna be a relentless effort by him and all of his like, you know [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2657.4s)]
*  I don't doze douchebag wanna be elans, you know to say like oh all this irrational elan derangement syndrome [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2665.0800000000004s)]
*  Like I don't know [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2673.32s)]
*  Maybe go talk to the people in places like sudan who are dying right now because they're not getting nutrition the way [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2674.36s)]
*  These guys think they're the victims, you know, you and I were talking about this before. I got criticized online [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2679.24s)]
*  How dare you tweet me tweeted me on the platform I own where I can ban you. Yeah, um people should be [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2683.72s)]
*  Uh boycotting tesla. Yeah boycott tesla. I'm not saying like harm teslas or just do not buy [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2689.4799999999996s)]
*  Just don't ever buy anything that elon musk makes. I honestly for a long time. I like wanted a [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2694.8399999999997s)]
*  One of those tesla power walls at my house [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2699.9599999999996s)]
*  Because I like I am actually worried about blackouts in la but like there's absolutely no way that I would buy one from tesla [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2703.0s)]
*  Now don't you buy anything from tesla? It's like he's a terrible person. It's maybe some sort of economic impact will matter to him because he's fucking [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2708.52s)]
*  Rapacious billionaires actually really care if they're the number one richest or the number three like that's how awful they are [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2716.2599999999998s)]
*  He will care more about that [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2722.2s)]
*  Than he will care about the assessment of how many people die because he cut off usid [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2723.96s)]
*  So please boycott and to all the people who say well [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2728.28s)]
*  You know the climate impact of creating teslas and calcula like he has already done more harm [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2731.88s)]
*  And his couple months in government than good than he has ever done buying your tesla is [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2736.92s)]
*  There are other evs and you know, guess what? It's a drop in the bucket compared to carme cheaper and better made [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2741.96s)]
*  Okay, let's move on to the russia b as earlier today trump and vladimir putin spoke on the phone about the war in ukraine [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2747.48s)]
*  It's interesting that they previewed this one ben as like trump has previously suggested in some news conferences that he's talked to putin a [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2754.04s)]
*  Few times since he's been in the white house [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2759.88s)]
*  But I guess who really knows because they're a bunch of liars [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2761.16s)]
*  So nbc news says the call was at least an hour and a half long other outlets said it was up to three hours [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2763.96s)]
*  I was talking to some of our our team here like I suspect that's a lot because of translation and also because [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2770.92s)]
*  Putin likes to give um long [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2776.92s)]
*  Historical rants about his grievances. Yeah, I imagine trump's even gets a flavor of that [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2779.24s)]
*  But who knows so the biggest deliverable out of the call [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2784.7599999999998s)]
*  Is putin saying he's agreed not to bomb ukraine's energy infrastructure for 30 days [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2788.44s)]
*  What a win, um trump announced at the end of winter by the way [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2794.52s)]
*  So like this is not i haven't seen this point on the coverage [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2798.28s)]
*  But they bombed the energy infrastructure in like november december heading into the winter [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2800.36s)]
*  Guess what time of the year it is is march april. Yeah, putin doesn't need to bomb the energy infrastructure anymore [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2804.12s)]
*  It also it doesn't get unbombed. Yeah, it's not working [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2808.6s)]
*  Anyway, so also trump they announced they're going to begin talks about a possible ceasefire in the black sea [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2811.7200000000003s)]
*  It's worth noting that there have been these little partial ceasefires along the way [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2816.76s)]
*  Between the russians and ukrainians friend of the pot max said and tweeted an analysis of putin's russian language readout of the call with trump [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2820.1200000000003s)]
*  Max's big takeaway is that putin gave almost no ground [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2828.44s)]
*  Putin wants a total end to foreign military support and intelligence to ukraine [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2832.0400000000004s)]
*  The readout said that any deal must quote take into account the unconditional necessity to remove the initial reasons for the crisis [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2836.6800000000003s)]
*  And russia's legal security interests, um, you could drive a truck through kind of the implications of that language which we can unpack in a second [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2843.48s)]
*  Um the readout the readout also says that trump and putin talked about some non-ukraine topics [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2850.8399999999997s)]
*  Including mutually beneficial partnership in economics and security some sort of cooperation in the middle east non-proliferation [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2855.48s)]
*  And then some shit about hosting hockey games [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2861.64s)]
*  Which I guess means it just effectively ends the kind of sports isolation of russia which trump's probably not even aware of [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2863.72s)]
*  Yeah, he's so fucking dumb right if you all be great if we have hockey games [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2869.7200000000003s)]
*  He doesn't realize he's just like removed a huge source of pressure on it [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2872.76s)]
*  It is a big carrot right because like the russians were competing the olympics under like some non-flag [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2876.12s)]
*  I can't remember what it looked like but anyway, it sucked for them. They were pissed about it the goon flag [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2880.44s)]
*  Yeah, the goon flag and now it's uh now they're just back [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2884.04s)]
*  I guess so I guess like look my takeaway then was I I don't want to [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2887.0s)]
*  Criticize diplomacy just because trump is doing it [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2891.2400000000002s)]
*  But I think we should be honest that a one-month energy ceasefire is not only not that much given the context you just [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2893.08s)]
*  talked about about you know the time of year, but also [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2899.4s)]
*  Trump pushed the ukrainians to sign a 30-day unconditional ceasefire and putin was like nah i'm good [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2902.52s)]
*  Uh, and he also didn't signal any real willingness to give ground on other stuff [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2909.32s)]
*  So I don't know what was accomplished. Maybe putin agreed to buy a bunch of trump coin with uh, russian oil and gas half kidding about that [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2913.08s)]
*  But what were your takeaways from this? Well, yeah, first of all in the time I [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2919.48s)]
*  hearing that brought back, you know [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2924.28s)]
*  Not great memories of I sat through probably I don't know after the [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2926.76s)]
*  Invasion of Crimea up through the end of the obama administration [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2931.8s)]
*  I probably sat through five or six of these like two-hour phone calls [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2934.6800000000003s)]
*  And it makes it sound like a really substantive robust conversation [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2938.6000000000004s)]
*  Each side probably spoke three or four times in those two hours because putin sits there and reads like a 20 minute speech [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2941.96s)]
*  About literally reads reads about all of his fucking grievances and how hard what bunch of bastards the ukrainians are and [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2949.4s)]
*  He gives you a history lesson going all the way back. You're like way back, you know the [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2956.44s)]
*  You know bulgaria joining nato and shit ottoman empire and then that has to be fucking translated [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2960.28s)]
*  And and so you're sitting there and you're like so then we put out like they spoke for two hours [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2965.0800000000004s)]
*  And i'm like it's not as cool as you guys think it is, you know, but anyway put that aside [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2968.92s)]
*  Yeah, I think that what's amazing about this is [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2972.84s)]
*  he's just walking along this path where [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2976.2000000000003s)]
*  Putin is literally taking the things that he would [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2978.44s)]
*  Usually have to negotiate at the end of the fucking negotiation, right? [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2981.7200000000003s)]
*  Ukraine can't rearm can't have foreign forces there can't get any intel [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2986.04s)]
*  You can't join nato like his whole list [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2991.72s)]
*  He's even laundering in his version of history [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2995.3999999999996s)]
*  You know, he congratulates trump for not voting for the u.n's resolution the general assembly resolution calling the aggressor like, you know [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=2997.56s)]
*  Good job donaldton taking a voting with me and belarus on that and he's trying to pull all these issues forward [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3004.6s)]
*  Into the negotiation about the 30-day ceasefire and trump is such is so thirsty for either a combination of putin's [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3011.1600000000003s)]
*  friendship and in some [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3019.78s)]
*  Partial news cycle win that he's literally celebrating like a partial [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3021.96s)]
*  ceasefire around just hitting energy targets [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3028.2000000000003s)]
*  When he didn't get anything else like putin is not moved up off of any other position literally [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3032.44s)]
*  The only thing putin can be said to have done that is any different tomorrow than today [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3038.2s)]
*  If he actually fucking does it and I could see him just violating it [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3042.68s)]
*  Anyway, is this thing about not hitting energy targets and then you know, meanwhile, he's just adding to the list of demands on the ukrainians [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3045.48s)]
*  and [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3053.16s)]
*  This is what happens when you humiliate the ukrainian president the oval office cut him off from intelligence and military support [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3053.96s)]
*  Which putin grabbed you notice that like putin said oh like see [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3061.16s)]
*  Well, like you better go back to cutting them off because I saw you did that once before [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3064.52s)]
*  You can do that again, right? [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3067.96s)]
*  So putin is just like moving the goalposts further and further in his direction and we're not negotiating peace. We're negotiating literally like [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3069.2400000000002s)]
*  Russian demands on behalf of putin well putin's moving the goalposts as are the trump team [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3076.84s)]
*  I mean there was a there was a leak in semaphore like today or yesterday about how [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3081.7200000000003s)]
*  Uh trump is considering recognizing russian control of krymia now [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3085.96s)]
*  I I don't think there's any like peace deal that ends with the ukrainian sides [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3090.04s)]
*  Fully controlling krymia, but why are you giving that away? [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3095.08s)]
*  I mean, it's just this is like and anybody like and this is what like you made this point last week and it's true [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3098.52s)]
*  Anybody who's ever had any experience with putin? [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3106.44s)]
*  And this is exactly what he does [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3109.56s)]
*  He just tries to pocket every single thing at the table before even entertaining any concession by himself [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3111.48s)]
*  And none of these guys have ever trump thinks that [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3118.6s)]
*  and what gov that like, you know selling some fucking golf courses in florida is like akin to like [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3121.48s)]
*  dealing with [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3127.48s)]
*  Issues that have been at the subject of war and peace and geopolitical tension for hundreds of years [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3129.08s)]
*  In ukraine like these guys have no idea what they're doing putin is in no rush either. No, why what rush is he in? [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3134.2799999999997s)]
*  The broader context is you know, we talked late last year [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3140.12s)]
*  I think in august about this surprising ukrainian offensive into kursk [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3143.48s)]
*  Which is part of russia and they occupied like 500 miles square miles worth of territory within russia in the kursk region [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3147.64s)]
*  The russians along with these north korean troops have slowly but methodically battled back and pushed the ukrainian forces out of kursk [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3155.2400000000002s)]
*  Except for like a sliver right along the border that the ukrainian forces are now using [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3162.76s)]
*  To keep the high ground and prevent essentially the russians from entering into another part of ukraine [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3166.84s)]
*  So putin knows that [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3172.68s)]
*  The the momentum is on his side, you know [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3175.08s)]
*  The the americans are no longer supporting the ukrainian side [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3178.36s)]
*  Uh, he's getting reinforcements from north korea [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3182.92s)]
*  The weapons are flowing from iran and others and so things are just he's looking good [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3186.6s)]
*  So if i'm putin i'm thinking i'm in this job for life this dipshit's there for [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3191.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, four years i'm gonna play this negotiate negotiation out as long as I can get whatever I want from it [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3195.64s)]
*  Wait this idiot out and then play the next guy who's in the job [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3202.12s)]
*  And by the way, he also loved in the russian readout. They had this language about you know, the u.s [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3205.0s)]
*  And sorry russia and the u.s, you know consistent with their international responsibilities [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3209.7999999999997s)]
*  Talked about this in the middle east and that he's making himself bigger in the united states smaller, you know [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3214.52s)]
*  Like it's and and and trump is not even aware that that's what he's doing [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3222.2s)]
*  You know, yeah, it's oh god trump who ostensibly thinks that the the big fish are him and shijin ping [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3226.12s)]
*  Yeah, no, no now it's like shijin ping's the big fish and then like trump is in the second class with pudin. Great. Great [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3231.32s)]
*  Uh, okay. Let's switch gears here ben and talk about uh, these massive protests in serbia [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3237.4s)]
*  I don't know if we've talked about this on the show before no, we should have but yeah, you're right. We should have [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3241.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, so this past weekend, um [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3244.92s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of protesters took to the streets in belgrade to protest against the government [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3247.2400000000002s)]
*  The government corruption and president alexander bucic. There were reports of up to 300 000 people which in serbia is a massive number [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3251.96s)]
*  So these are student-led protests. They've been happening since last november [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3258.2s)]
*  There's this horrible incident where a concrete canopy that was part of the newly renovated train station collapsed and killed 15 people [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3261.72s)]
*  As often happens with protests like this though over time they evolved from being about, you know [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3268.52s)]
*  Outrage about this tragic incident at the novice hodge rail station to outrage about corruption generally the lack of transparency about [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3273.16s)]
*  construction of this train station the treatment of protesters [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3280.98s)]
*  Uh, which include, you know mass arrests of individuals who are on the streets [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3284.14s)]
*  But also these government-sponsored efforts to harass and violently assault protesters some really bleak stuff [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3288.46s)]
*  there was a video that ben and I you saw this weekend of like, uh, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3293.2599999999998s)]
*  Reports of a sonic weapon being used on protesters. So pretty awful [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3296.94s)]
*  So on monday the protesters even blocked access to a serbian public tv station called rts because of the way it was reporting [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3301.18s)]
*  On them, I guess a journalist referred to them the peaceful protesters as a mob [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3307.74s)]
*  So president the president of serbia this guy named alexander vucic. He's been in serbian politics for decades in the late 90s [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3312.06s)]
*  He was slobodan milosevic's information minister. How about that fucking job? That's a great thing in your fucking tv [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3318.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3324.62s)]
*  So for those who don't know milosevic was charged with war crimes and genocide and put on trial at the international criminal court [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3324.94s)]
*  Uh, there was a massacre horrific massacre in 1995 or 8 000 bosnian muslims were killed by uh, [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3330.54s)]
*  By bosnian serb forces and vucic said quote you kill one serb and we kill 100 muslims as a quote attributed to the current president [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3336.8599999999997s)]
*  So charming guy more recently vucic has been head of the serbian progressive party since 2012 [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3343.74s)]
*  He was prime minister from 2014 to 2017 has been and has been president of serbia [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3349.8199999999997s)]
*  Not those kind of progressives. No 20. Yeah. Yeah, don't let the name fool you the name of the party fool you [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3354.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, he's far right. He's authoritarian national socialist. We're not socialists. Yes something. We unfortunately have to clarify in the show as well [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3358.62s)]
*  Um, he's authoritarian. He's far right. He's also someone who he'll mouth like pro-eu pro-western [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3365.34s)]
*  Sentiment, I think he gets a lot of credit from the population or has gotten leeway for their economic growth recently [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3371.16s)]
*  But like, you know every autocrat like corruption catches up to you [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3377.66s)]
*  Um, so that gets us back to these protests. Um, vucic has blamed the protests on leftist radicals [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3381.02s)]
*  He's blaming the united states and usaid [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3387.5s)]
*  Um, then it's always interesting to note which americans are dumb enough to regurgitate [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3390.38s)]
*  Those kinds of claims by authoritarian leaders, which brings us to [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3396.2200000000003s)]
*  A clip from a recent episode of donald trump jr's podcast triggered where he interviewed vucic [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3400.46s)]
*  Here's a clip and we also talk about the protests you've been seeing in belgrade. I'm sure the media will cover them [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3407.7400000000002s)]
*  Uh only one way there's seemingly evidence that they are all tied in some form [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3413.5800000000004s)]
*  To the same left-wing actors here in america [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3419.82s)]
*  There's even some reported links to usaid [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3423.42s)]
*  It feels to me as someone who's watched this play out in america and with my family a tragic incident, of course [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3426.78s)]
*  but it was later weaponized perhaps like [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3434.94s)]
*  uh our [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3438.6200000000003s)]
*  january 6th [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3440.06s)]
*  I was saying the same [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3441.6600000000003s)]
*  To my people here. It was huge amount of money that was [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3444.3s)]
*  Invested from outside [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3448.94s)]
*  From different countries [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3451.9s)]
*  Different foundations [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3454.94s)]
*  Well, there's there's another planned protest in a couple of days how much of that is is manufactured [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3456.94s)]
*  I've read and i've seen and spoken to other people here [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3463.82s)]
*  Some of these protests they're offering kids a hundred euro to show up [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3467.02s)]
*  So a little supercut of don jr regurgitating kind of right-wing autocrat talking points. I mean it's worth pointing a bench. Uh, [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3470.94s)]
*  Friend of the pod rick grinell was like a special envoy for serbia. He's become thick with vucic. There's all those reports [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3477.82s)]
*  of the serbian government giving approval to [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3486.38s)]
*  Jared kushner or some developer in dubai the trump family to build like a trump family hotel [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3490.1400000000003s)]
*  On the site of the former yugoslav ministry of defense in belgrade that was bombed by nato in 1999 [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3494.7000000000003s)]
*  I think there was a something part of the lease said that there had to be a memorial to those injured or killed by nato [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3499.9s)]
*  Yeah by us anyway [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3506.22s)]
*  then [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3508.22s)]
*  Thoughts on this protest movement and why it is that there's always a nexus between the trump family and like the shittiest autocrats in the world [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3509.18s)]
*  Oh god, well, let's start with like the dumb part and then the good part [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3518.54s)]
*  I mean the i'm so fucking sick [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3522.62s)]
*  I mean maybe one good thing that could come from the us aid being shuttered is maybe these guys can stop blaming everything on [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3524.46s)]
*  Us aid or something or what they're alluding to i'm sure is like george soros and the open society foundations, you know [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3531.58s)]
*  Probably that's what i mean in february the serbian police raided four ngo's [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3539.1s)]
*  They said that was because they had us aid ties [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3543.66s)]
*  But three of the four had gotten like a small amount of money from us aid one had gotten none [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3545.66s)]
*  None of them are the reason these people are protesting and this is that's right. They'll go and they'll find you know [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3549.66s)]
*  Somebody got like 50 000 grand for like new computers from us aid or something [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3555.02s)]
*  And suddenly the reason that there's millions of people on the street. I mean they assign [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3560.7000000000003s)]
*  or even open societies, which does great work, but like [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3565.42s)]
*  If open society, you know, the soros foundation was as all-powerful as these people, you know [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3568.94s)]
*  We wouldn't be in the fucking mess. We're right. There'd be left in government area [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3574.2200000000003s)]
*  Like this is not what is happening in the world, you know [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3578.46s)]
*  So i'm just so tired the fact that people they've been on the same talking points about [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3581.34s)]
*  Soros and us aid and foreign funding for for 20 years now, you know [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3586.62s)]
*  And the fact that people still swallow that shit is such like [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3591.42s)]
*  The amount of money that the trump people are going to put in there and their various developments is far more than [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3595.34s)]
*  Than they came in from us aid or some foundations. I will say on a hopeful note [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3600.86s)]
*  This is a entirely organic student-led [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3605.82s)]
*  Movement that is able to get like i'm not that good at math [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3609.02s)]
*  But it's like something like five percent of the population if you're talking about 300 000 people on the street [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3612.62s)]
*  They're wildly popular too wildly popular innovative. They're have they look like they're having fun [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3616.8599999999997s)]
*  Message to america like where are we like we need to get out in the streets like this [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3621.8199999999997s)]
*  This is the only thing that has a remote chance of arresting a democratic backsliding is to see [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3626.14s)]
*  This number of people out in the streets [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3632.14s)]
*  300 000 people in serbia is like having millions and millions and millions of people out in the streets here [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3634.14s)]
*  And and I think my hope is [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3639.18s)]
*  It is showing that there are people in parts serbia is a tough place to protest too, right? [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3641.58s)]
*  You're taking some degree of risk. You've got a creepy pretty autocratic president. He's kind of [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3647.02s)]
*  Kind of like putin adjacent, right? [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3652.14s)]
*  This is you know [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3655.8199999999997s)]
*  Hopefully breaking the fear factor for people to stand up against these far-right movements or these kind of corrupt [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3656.54s)]
*  And it also shows you that the argument the thing that got people in the streets at the end of the day [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3662.22s)]
*  Was not just about like democracy. It was more about corruption. It was more about we know these people have patronage networks [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3666.94s)]
*  We know that their autocracy is directly screwing us [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3673.2599999999998s)]
*  It's leading to things like this thing collapsing and that's getting people killed [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3676.14s)]
*  And so I think it's a message that this combination of like using corruption as a motivator and using protest as a vehicle [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3679.58s)]
*  Is something that can be replicated in other places? Yeah, I mean right exactly [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3686.7s)]
*  I mean vuchic calls the protesters. He said it's a color revolution. He says it's usad [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3690.94s)]
*  It's total bullshit that the the government allowed a bunch of chinese companies to renovate this railway [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3695.58s)]
*  Like a year ago this rail station and then this giant piece of concrete collapsed and killed [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3703.58s)]
*  15 people so that's why people took to the streets and this movement [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3708.54s)]
*  There was a great I think it's al jazeera did a great piece on the protesters [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3712.2200000000003s)]
*  They've been organized in a really interesting way in that there's no leader. Yes, like these students will get together. It's like hong kong [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3715.98s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. It's just like hong kong like they'll all get together in some big, you know [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3721.34s)]
*  You know hall or something like a [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3726.38s)]
*  Big lecture room. Yeah, and they'll put forward ideas and they'll all vote on them and they've been doing interesting things like walking on foot [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3728.86s)]
*  From for miles and miles from city to city and something like 80 percent of the population of the serbian population [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3735.42s)]
*  Supports their demands which are pretty focused around like transparency [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3742.04s)]
*  Accountability not punishing the protesters supporting higher education. So you're right [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3746.44s)]
*  I mean, I do think despite what vuchet says despite what fucking morons like don jr said like this is the way [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3750.86s)]
*  Yeah for anyone. Yes, this is the way can't a living under a torturing rule [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3756.86s)]
*  Well, and and one other thing i'd say is that like in addition to being specific in their demands being creative in their tactics [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3761.1800000000003s)]
*  Having fun by the way, it's a good thing to like it's a fun protest together move it [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3766.6200000000003s)]

*  They made an alliance of labor, right? [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3772.54s)]
*  And so they have labor unions who have like, you know their own power bases [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3774.38s)]
*  And so that's an interesting way to like you start with students and then you bring in labor and then all of a sudden [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3778.22s)]
*  You're bringing in other people. Right? Yep. That's exactly right. Yeah [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3782.46s)]

*  Or is it like the massive amounts of chinese money paying for shitty infrastructure projects lining the pockets of vuchich cronies? [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3796.54s)]

*  Genocidal war criminal. Uh, let's just close out this section by listening to [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3812.1200000000003s)]
*  A clip of some protesters who spoke to the bbc [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3816.46s)]

*  It's just awful living in this kind of climate in serbia right now [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3831.7400000000002s)]

*  It felt like a celebration of democracy the protest gave me back the pride I had in my country [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3842.1400000000003s)]

*  I guess the restaurant chains like didn't respond forever and then finally like [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3892.7s)]
*  People were not thrilled with the food safety implications [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=3896.94s)]

*  so, uh, I really recommend everybody read this book, it's uh, it's it's tough but bracing and [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4419.259999999999s)]
*  fearless and [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4428.0599999999995s)]
*  Connects so many different threads [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4430.0599999999995s)]
*  To answer kind of a question that you pose in the book that I think kind of sums it up how did israel [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4432.3s)]
*  A country built to house a persecuted and homeless people come to exercise such a terrible power [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4437.26s)]
*  Of life and death over another population of refugees many of them refugees in their own land [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4441.9800000000005s)]
*  And how can the western political and journalistic mainstream ignore even justify its clearly systematic cruelties and injustice, uh, which you know [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4446.860000000001s)]
*  I feel like the book, uh [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4455.02s)]
*  sets out to answer that question through [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4457.18s)]
*  everything from intellectual history to [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4459.660000000001s)]
*  Political analysis to to wrestling with current events [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4462.14s)]
*  Before we dive into that though [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4466.14s)]
*  It's interesting we're speaking the day after israel resumed its bombardment of gaza [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4469.9800000000005s)]
*  And [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4476.38s)]
*  I wonder what your reaction is to that [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4477.900000000001s)]
*  Event because it feels to me like as shocking as these images are and hundreds of people killed children killed [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4481.18s)]
*  Um people are so worn down [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4489.02s)]
*  By experiencing this [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4492.14s)]
*  How do you connect? [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4494.700000000001s)]
*  You know being out in the world talking about this book which is about the world after gaza [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4496.14s)]
*  To the kind of resumption of what we're seeing in gaza. Well, but it's become more and more difficult, you know [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4500.38s)]
*  Because in a way I was one of those people who did not believe the ceasefire would last [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4507.1s)]
*  Uh, it was extremely fragile. And of course it was being violated all through these previous weeks previous [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4513.660000000001s)]
*  For eight weeks [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4520.54s)]
*  but if [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4523.02s)]
*  In any case, I mean, I think you know the [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4524.46s)]
*  Sudden violation of it this morning, uh, and uh, you know number of casualties just in a single day [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4527.660000000001s)]
*  I think it's the current figures are more than 150 children [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4534.700000000001s)]
*  It's still it's still it leaves you speechless. Um, and you know again that question like what what strategic? [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4538.700000000001s)]
*  objectives, uh what geopolitical [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4545.96s)]
*  Goals are being met [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4549.02s)]
*  through this kind of indiscriminate bombing and it's very clear again the answer is that [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4551.66s)]
*  Nathan yahu is doing this in order to preserve [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4556.54s)]
*  His um at this point weakening hold on power [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4560.06s)]
*  We know that uh, he's you know, few few steps away from prison and he keeps postponing that that that sort of moment [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4563.26s)]
*  Uh somehow and there are people in his cabinet [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4570.62s)]
*  Who help him do this? And of course there is now the trump administration [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4573.42s)]
*  Willing to give him a green light, um to to really whatever he wants to do at this point [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4577.04s)]
*  so I think in a way we are in a more kind of desperate stage where [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4584.4s)]
*  The culture and politics of cruelty is now, you know truly global [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4590.24s)]
*  um, especially especially after the arrival of of president trump in the white house and [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4596.24s)]
*  There is simply no really recourse [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4601.84s)]
*  To any ideas of you know, sustainable peace or let let alone, you know things like compassion or empathy [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4604.96s)]
*  well, I think what's so [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4612.8s)]
*  important about your book is you step back from this and you you look at the kind of narratives and [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4614.96s)]
*  um [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4622.24s)]
*  Identity politics for lack of a better way of putting it that helped produce the moment we're in [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4624.54s)]
*  um, and and you know people I should just say [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4631.2s)]
*  Some people may find this a challenging read. I I hope people read this book who might [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4634.24s)]
*  Go into that being inclined to disagree with it [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4638.8s)]
*  I think that that's actually the most important reader for you [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4640.88s)]
*  so i'm going to go through some of those pieces of it and one that you talk about a lot is is the [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4643.5199999999995s)]
*  interconnection between [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4649.58s)]
*  Israel and the holocaust and how that has evolved over time [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4650.96s)]
*  and and i'll tell you pangas I I [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4654.639999999999s)]
*  um, I I was very challenged by this because i'm one of those people i'm a secular jew [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4656.96s)]
*  Who grew up in my identity was not religious, but it was tied to the holocaust, right? [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4662.320000000001s)]
*  We had family in the holocaust and and israel was a part of the reckoning for the holocaust and kind of my [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4666.72s)]
*  Self-conception right that it was an achievement [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4673.9800000000005s)]
*  um to have this kind of safe haven and and yet you kind of build I think a pretty compelling case [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4676.8s)]
*  that [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4683.12s)]
*  It wasn't immediately, you know zionism obviously predated the holocaust and even when the state of israel was [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4684.8s)]
*  declared independent the holocaust did not play as central role in its identity as it came to do later [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4690.799999999999s)]
*  um and [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4697.36s)]
*  And you kind of talk about and to quote from the book this deepening fixation with the shoah and official israeli rhetoric [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4699.28s)]
*  And a radical re-envisioning of israel's identity and purpose as a country that would forever be on guard against another shoah [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4704.719999999999s)]
*  Which I think is a statement that nobody would really disagree with [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4710.719999999999s)]
*  talk about why that [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4714.48s)]
*  what [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4717.12s)]
*  To kind of tee you up here [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4718.56s)]
*  You kind of make an argument that that kind of [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4720.72s)]
*  infinitely justifies anything israel does vis-a-vis security threats vis-a-vis the palestinians that that if you are [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4723.42s)]
*  imbued with that kind of moral [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4730.080000000001s)]
*  Mission to prevent another holocaust you you you kind of have a certain impunity [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4732.88s)]
*  Why did you decide to focus on this piece of of the conflict in the israeli identity? [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4738.8s)]
*  You know because ben like many many people out there [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4744.0s)]
*  um, I tended to think that the memory of the holocaust at least, you know as as as commemorated in in israel [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4747.120000000001s)]
*  flowed very naturally out of this, you know, extraordinary, uh traumatic experience of it and there were survivors [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4755.84s)]
*  Who then you know transmitted their memories to their children and and and so [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4764.240000000001s)]
*  Within the culture at large that memory was slowly sort of institutionalized in a way [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4769.360000000001s)]
*  But then much to my great shock I discovered that was certainly not the case [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4774.4800000000005s)]
*  And that in fact the survivors were treated with great contempt [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4778.88s)]
*  when they first arrived in the state of israel because they [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4782.64s)]
*  Seemed to project an image of weakness that the leaders of the state of israel at that point [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4786.64s)]
*  Recoiled from because they were invested in a very different image of israel altogether. It's this very [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4793.2s)]
*  Strong country. So it's only in the 1960s [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4798.160000000001s)]
*  That politicians turned to invoking the holocaust as a sort of shared narrative as a kind of nation-binding glue [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4801.4400000000005s)]
*  For the israeli population you have to remember, you know last part of the israeli population at that point [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4810.320000000001s)]
*  In fact more than 50 percent consisted of people who had come to israel from arab countries [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4814.320000000001s)]
*  And so they had to be educated into this, you know european experience and to this european narrative [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4820.08s)]
*  so [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4827.200000000001s)]
*  I think you know unscrupulous far-right politicians started to [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4828.4800000000005s)]
*  Deploy the shoah, you know precisely at the point [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4832.54s)]
*  Again worth remembering when in the 1960s when israel actually becomes a supreme military power in the middle east [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4836.88s)]
*  So on one hand you have you know, this this extraordinary military power, which is you know capable of taking on simultaneously [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4844.400000000001s)]
*  several [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4851.92s)]
*  Arab nation-states several arab armies and defeating them at the same time [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4852.96s)]
*  There is this emphasis on the idea that the shoah happened once it could happen again [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4857.68s)]
*  And that you're living in a country that's surrounded by potential nazis, you know that that the israel israel's borders are as moshadiyan put it [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4864.4800000000005s)]
*  the borders of akshwitz [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4873.04s)]
*  um, so this kind of you know, very deliberately cultivated paranoia is is is something [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4874.8s)]
*  That replaces really, you know what what might have been for some people at least a memory flowing out of that particular experience [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4882.56s)]
*  So what i'm trying to say is in the book is that you know individual memory is one thing [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4889.36s)]
*  Collective memory is quite another collective memory is always constructed with very particular [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4893.36s)]
*  Ideological ends and that is certainly the case here with with the memory of the holocaust in in israel [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4901.1s)]
*  Well, and I want to apply this to a number of things that are happening on the world right now. So [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4906.32s)]
*  um [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4910.4800000000005s)]
*  because basically, you know part of what follows from that idea is that [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4911.4400000000005s)]
*  the the risk of [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4915.68s)]
*  a genocide of the jewish people the risk of anti-semitism [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4918.0s)]
*  You kind of show how it transferred from [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4922.72s)]
*  actual nazis, you know the german flavor to to kind of putting that on the palestinians or the arabs, right that [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4925.76s)]
*  Even though there was no evidence that they you know, they they never they weren't responsible for the holocaust, right? [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4932.56s)]
*  But what confuses me pankaj, I I you know, what do you make of the fact that today? [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4938.4800000000005s)]
*  um [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4945.040000000001s)]
*  The discourse on anti-semitism particularly in this country [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4946.160000000001s)]
*  tends to focus almost wholly on hamas or the kind of left, right so [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4949.4400000000005s)]
*  hamas which did horrific horrific [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4955.040000000001s)]
*  Pogrom on october 7th, but I I don't think anyone would think that hamas is capable of destroying the state of israel [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4957.92s)]
*  But even to go beyond that, you know [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4964.88s)]
*  College kids getting deported from you know columbia because they they pose some violent threat to jews. There's this kind of [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4967.68s)]
*  this zero tolerance for [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4975.36s)]
*  Essentially criticism of israel or solidarity with a certain kind of palestinian politics [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4977.68s)]
*  At the same time that we see a rise of the very far-right ethnonationalism in europe and the united states that [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4983.04s)]
*  I think [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4989.36s)]
*  Actually [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4990.72s)]
*  Was the political force that led to the actual holocaust? [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4991.84s)]
*  So what do you make of this redirection that at precisely the time that we see these kind of echoes of the 30s in? [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=4994.240000000001s)]
*  the rise of ethnonationalism in the in the west [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5000.88s)]
*  Instead of focusing on that the entire anti-semitic [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5004.72s)]
*  Conversation anti-semitism seems to be focused on either the palestinians or or the western left [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5008.320000000001s)]
*  Well, it's fascinating. I think it attests in in in a very significant way to the success of the israeli narrative [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5013.52s)]
*  You know that we are under [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5019.76s)]
*  Sort of constant we live with this constant threat of being exterminated and this is a narrative that the state of israel [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5021.4400000000005s)]
*  Has very successfully persuaded many other people outside of israel to believe and to subscribe to [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5028.72s)]
*  So this is why you have this sort of you know, extraordinary disparity or discrepancy where you know [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5035.2s)]
*  Israel is a is a formidable military power. You can see that right away [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5040.4800000000005s)]
*  You know because it's engaged in a war [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5044.0s)]
*  With yemen with syria with lebanon and of course [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5046.56s)]
*  It's bombing gaza as we speak and doing that without any serious military [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5050.08s)]
*  Response whatsoever from any of these parties that it's engaged in in in this war with [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5055.84s)]
*  um, so you have you know israel becoming stronger and stronger partly thanks to american support [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5060.64s)]
*  and [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5066.400000000001s)]
*  at the same time [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5067.360000000001s)]
*  Becoming closer and closer to far-right formations across europe and of course the united states the the christian evangelicals [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5068.96s)]
*  So the object of anxieties for many people in the united states, which is the state of israel [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5077.68s)]
*  What they have really not noticed is how? [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5082.96s)]
*  uh in in in kind of really disturbing ways [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5085.92s)]
*  The state that they wish to be protective of or sympathetic to [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5089.92s)]
*  Has gone down this very dangerous very sinister path of closer and closer alliances [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5094.080000000001s)]
*  With not only far-right, you know political groups or personalities or governments in europe, but actually actively [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5100.72s)]
*  Explicitly anti-semitic movements. There was a piece on haritz only yesterday about this, you know [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5108.540000000001s)]
*  Very very close links being developed between the state of israel and you know various notoriously anti-semitic [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5114.080000000001s)]
*  Organizations in europe. So this conversation in united states [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5121.5199999999995s)]
*  Seems to be completely detached from these developments, you know [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5126.099999999999s)]
*  The internal developments within the state of israel the rise the emergence of a far right [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5129.46s)]
*  And the fact that the israelis themselves the israeli regime [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5134.0199999999995s)]
*  Is today, you know establishing? [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5138.339999999999s)]
*  intimate relations [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5141.62s)]
*  with some of the most powerful [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5143.219999999999s)]
*  anti-semitics in the world [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5145.679999999999s)]
*  Well, you also talk about the relationship between [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5147.3s)]
*  uh narendra modi and and bb netanyahu [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5150.900000000001s)]
*  um, and [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5154.820000000001s)]
*  I wouldn't I want you to just describe for listeners who might not be familiar like what are the overlapping [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5156.900000000001s)]
*  roots and um [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5162.66s)]
*  The overlapping project of the hindu nationalism we see from modi and the kind of ethnic nationalism we see from netanyahu [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5165.06s)]
*  Is and is this the future of politics? I mean because if you know you it feels like that all around the world [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5172.120000000001s)]
*  There's a different flavor of this, you know, you know, I grew up in in in india [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5177.8s)]
*  In a hindu nationalist family, you know very sympathetic to israel and partly because you know israel we saw [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5182.4400000000005s)]
*  As a country that was merciless [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5188.68s)]
*  In its treatment of you know, potentially treacherous forces such as you know, the muslim population [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5191.320000000001s)]
*  Of of palestine. So that was one major [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5197.88s)]
*  Sort of source of admiration for us and I think today there are many more people in india who feel that way [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5201.240000000001s)]
*  You know netanyahu has his biggest fan base in in in india [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5207.240000000001s)]
*  Um, and and of course the modi government is actually an exception [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5211.72s)]
*  Within the global south within asia and africa and latin america in in having such close relations, and I think it's partly [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5215.72s)]
*  Because again, I think like other far-right formations or ethno-nationalist [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5222.52s)]
*  You know movements and and personalities they see israel [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5228.46s)]
*  Essentially as getting away [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5233.02s)]
*  Uh doing a lot of things that they would like to pull off but can't so israel really is is is a is a great [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5235.1s)]
*  Sort of object of envy for them [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5242.94s)]
*  And I think there's a kind of you know, ideological affinity, of course with the [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5245.42s)]
*  Majoritarian ethno-nationalist project but I think on a psychological level there is this great feeling of [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5249.88s)]
*  Identification with a country that can be so [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5256.5199999999995s)]
*  Indiscriminately brutal and and uncompromising and that is something they themselves aspire to so it's it [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5261.32s)]
*  It works at very many different levels here [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5268.54s)]
*  It's not just you know people point to arms sales or or increasing trade or india becoming part of some, you know [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5270.22s)]
*  middle eastern kind of [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5276.86s)]
*  anti-china [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5278.54s)]
*  Group or narrative but I think it's also really important to look at these ideological [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5279.58s)]
*  And psychological affinities between between between not only india and and israel but also other far-right groups and and israel today [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5284.56s)]
*  well if I were to play devil's advocate and [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5292.4800000000005s)]
*  And say [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5295.84s)]
*  from the perspective of a modi [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5297.12s)]
*  or a netanyahu [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5299.4400000000005s)]
*  Or any any number of these figures? [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5301.280000000001s)]
*  Putin has his own version of this history orban hungary lost territory after world one, etc [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5304.0s)]
*  um [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5309.52s)]
*  I think the way they wouldn't describe it, but I think the way their their minds might work is [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5310.8s)]
*  This world is corrupt. It's cruel. It's a tough place [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5316.72s)]
*  And you know what? [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5320.400000000001s)]
*  If we want to survive in this world, we might just need to be [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5321.76s)]
*  Cruel ourselves, you know that that the indians suffered under the yoke of the british and before that the mughal empire [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5326.24s)]
*  I guess and you know, the russians got humiliated at the end of the cold war. Obviously the jewish people have suffered [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5333.52s)]
*  For centuries and you know what you might not, you know guys like you and me might not like it [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5339.92s)]
*  But this is how the world works and if you don't have this kind of ethno-nationalist [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5343.76s)]
*  Strong man type state you're gonna end up being on the other end of that, you know [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5348.32s)]
*  How do you how do you wrestle with that possibility that that maybe they're right? [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5353.36s)]
*  I think you know, I mean that's certainly the trend right now [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5358.24s)]
*  And it was of course a trend back at the back in the 19th century [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5361.599999999999s)]
*  You know scrambled for africa all the sort of clashes between imperialist powers and then we saw two world wars in the 20th century [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5364.96s)]
*  I think the whole point of [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5371.92s)]
*  countries like india or or or places where people fought devoted a large part of their lives [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5373.92s)]
*  To fighting imperialism and fighting for national sovereignty was that we create a new world order where this kind of social darmanist [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5380.8s)]
*  survivalist mentality [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5389.42s)]
*  Which you know causes constant conflict causes [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5391.4400000000005s)]
*  Forces nations to live in this atmosphere of fear and paranoia [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5394.88s)]
*  That we can get away from all that create, you know society or international global order based on some shared norms [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5399.84s)]
*  Some some norms of civilization [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5406.8s)]
*  So if you want to go back there, you know to those dark days of of you know racial imperialism in in the 19th century kind of [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5409.36s)]
*  naked [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5417.900000000001s)]
*  exploitation [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5419.34s)]
*  naked expansion [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5420.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, you know, uh, maybe these people have a point [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5422.56s)]
*  But if we don't want to go back there and and find ourselves in a third world war [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5425.4400000000005s)]
*  Then I think we need to move away from these, you know, sort of fantasies of a purified [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5431.04s)]
*  National community a national community purified of its treacherous elements. Um all this, you know, it's it's really [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5438.06s)]
*  potentially extremely violent, you know not just to the nations themselves, but also to to to [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5445.900000000001s)]
*  To world peace at large. Um, so I think you know, these people may have persuaded [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5452.64s)]
*  Uh, you know some parts of their population that this is the right way [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5457.52s)]
*  But I think you know, you can see very clearly a future full of more and more conflict if not catastrophic [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5461.76s)]
*  World war yeah [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5468.96s)]
*  No, I the the history shows it leads to bad places and [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5470.080000000001s)]
*  I want to ask you about this because the world order seems to have unraveled at least as you know [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5474.400000000001s)]
*  The post-world war two u.s. Led order [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5479.6s)]
*  um [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5482.08s)]
*  you another core point of your book, which I think [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5483.04s)]
*  again, I I hope people in this country read because [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5486.88s)]
*  You make it very persuasively is that for most of the world's people, right? [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5490.08s)]
*  there's not the same narrative of the last hundred years where the central events were world war two and [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5494.160000000001s)]
*  The cold war and the holocaust. It's actually the story of decolonization [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5500.320000000001s)]
*  Which encompasses by the way many? [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5504.96s)]
*  Holocaust of non-white peoples and many liberation struggles and and you're kind of reflecting the perspective [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5507.12s)]
*  You know to use the the shorthand that can be problematic, but the global south view essentially the decolonized world [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5514.96s)]
*  It's probably looking at what's happening in the u.s. Now. It's certainly looking at what's happening in gaza now [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5523.2s)]
*  And and see it kind of confirming all of their worst [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5527.44s)]
*  Experiences and and perspectives on the west [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5531.44s)]
*  Is there a potential as someone who's you know written about this in other books too, do you see any potential for [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5534.96s)]
*  Some different kind of concept of order to generate not from within the west but from within the global south [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5542.32s)]
*  What is the first potential for something to emerge? [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5549.5199999999995s)]
*  out of this wreckage of a period of history we're living through in which some of the countries that are [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5552.96s)]
*  You know generally seen as more marginal to world events but are rising and in power and influence [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5560.72s)]
*  Could we see something emerge from that narrative that is? [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5565.84s)]
*  You know more durable [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5571.12s)]
*  Than than the order that president trump is currently deconstructing [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5573.12s)]
*  well, it's interesting you asked that you know, because [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5577.44s)]
*  Obviously india is not the the leader in the way it used to be of the you know [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5580.0s)]
*  Non-west as it were it was once, you know, it had this very morally prestigious position the leader right now is south africa [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5585.44s)]
*  South africa, which is kind of insisting that certain norms be be observed [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5592.48s)]
*  And and for that reason we know it risks a great deal [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5597.76s)]
*  By going to the hag by filing that case against the against the against the state of israel [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5601.599999999999s)]
*  But again, it comes out of that long experience of of fighting against [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5607.36s)]
*  You know racist imperialism of of fighting against racial discrimination and saying look we can't have this anymore. We can't have [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5612.08s)]
*  you know, uh, uh sort of a nation [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5619.92s)]
*  Whose borders have never been clearly defined that keeps expanding all the time then periodically bombing people [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5623.280000000001s)]
*  So I suppose the south african initiative in in in recent months a very risky initiative for which it is being [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5629.280000000001s)]
*  Severely punished as we speak by by by the trump administration [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5635.740000000001s)]
*  Is probably one sign [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5640.66s)]
*  That within the global south some of those energies that went into the anti-apartheid struggle or went into the struggle for [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5642.66s)]
*  decolonization the urge for a new world order those [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5650.32s)]
*  Impulses those desires are probably still alive and can occasionally take surprising forms like, you know [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5654.5599999999995s)]
*  The south african case against against israel, which again I say was a huge gamble [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5660.58s)]
*  You know and and a huge risk and obviously, you know [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5665.46s)]
*  They're paying paying the price for it right now [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5667.62s)]
*  And one last question, you know, another one of your books that I really liked is from the ruins of empire [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5670.26s)]
*  Where you detail some of the writers and thinkers from within? [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5676.0199999999995s)]
*  These parts of the world whether it's china india [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5679.7s)]
*  The islamic world who kind of seeded what became liberation movements [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5682.5s)]
*  um [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5687.54s)]
*  What is the role of the writer today? [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5688.58s)]
*  Because it can probably feel so overwhelming, you know people are on social media people [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5690.58s)]
*  Are in this kind of pretty dumbed down discourse you you know, or someone who've written for yeah [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5696.42s)]
*  The new yorker the new yorker view books, uh london review books write these books [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5701.62s)]
*  How do you think about the role of a political writer? [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5705.94s)]
*  in in this kind of very [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5708.9s)]
*  Um both scary and sometimes stupid period we're living through [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5711.54s)]
*  You know, that's um, I think ben [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5715.3s)]
*  I sometimes feel like all we can do is kind of keep opening up fresh perspectives [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5717.38s)]
*  Keep exploring experiences that haven't been explored before persuade people to step out of their you know boxes [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5722.12s)]
*  their silos [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5728.52s)]
*  Their particular narratives and and make them see that there are other ways of understanding this, you know [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5729.96s)]
*  other ways of perceiving the world [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5735.88s)]
*  And try and make them see how the other looks at it [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5738.2s)]
*  You know how how people on different in different parts of the world look at it [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5741.56s)]
*  And again as I said, there are so many histories and those are the histories that i've been engaging with [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5745.16s)]
*  That have not really been properly told because who will tell them, you know [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5749.5599999999995s)]
*  You need a lot of institutions a lot of institutional power a lot of cultural power [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5754.68s)]
*  To relate those histories and I think as you know responsible citizens, uh, whether as writers or just ordinary citizens [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5759.0s)]
*  It's our kind of responsibility [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5766.68s)]
*  To bring those experiences into play to make people think that there is not only just this one story [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5769.24s)]
*  Uh, there are so many different stories out there and you know, if if if as writers we can insist on the [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5775.8s)]
*  multiplicity of these stories and you know the multiple perspectives that that that go with those stories [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5783.22s)]
*  Then perhaps we would have made, you know, a tiny contribution. Obviously, we don't have any kind of political power [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5789.72s)]
*  We can you know, we watch as helplessly [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5794.84s)]
*  As anyone else the mayhem in the world today, but at least you know, we can make a small difference [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5797.4s)]
*  Just by creating this little archive [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5803.799999999999s)]
*  That's you know people can can can can look to for some kind of intellectual and and even perhaps emotional support. Yeah [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5806.44s)]
*  Well, look, I really appreciate the conversation. Uh, the book is the world after gaza people should read it if you [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5814.679999999999s)]
*  Have been critical of israel. You will learn much about the history of how we got here [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5821.16s)]
*  If you are supportive of israel, I think you [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5826.28s)]
*  It's even more important again for you to kind of uh wrestle with some of the difficult [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5829.32s)]
*  Questions that are raised in the book. So pankaj. Thanks for writing the book and thanks for joining us [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvv7R0Cq9tM&t=5833.719999999999s)]
