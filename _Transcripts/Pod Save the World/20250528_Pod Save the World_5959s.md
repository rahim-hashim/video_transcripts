# Trump’s Global Corruption Is Even Worse Than You Think
**Pod Save the World:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco)
*  Welcome back to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Ben Rhodes. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2.0s)]
*  We are talking to Ben. I'm talking to Ben. Just hours before the Knicks and the Pacers. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3.0s)]
*  I may have just been looking at Knicks Twitter. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=7.0s)]
*  Well, you got game four, the Eastern Conference Finals. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=9.0s)]
*  Depending on how things go, I think this section could sound really fun, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=12.0s)]
*  or it could be as awkward as the conversation between Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=17.0s)]
*  after she slapped the shit out of him on the plane in Vietnam. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=21.0s)]
*  Way to bring in the World of Content. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=24.0s)]
*  You following that story? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=26.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm following that story. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=27.0s)]
*  I mean, I will tell you after game one, when the Knicks blew somehow like a 12-point lead in two minutes, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=29.0s)]
*  and like 900 things had to happen for that to happen, I actually just lost consciousness. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=34.0s)]
*  You went dark for a while. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=39.0s)]
*  I fell asleep on a hotel bed with all the lights on, fully clothed, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=40.0s)]
*  and I don't even remember falling asleep. It was just like my body couldn't handle what had just happened to shut down. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=45.0s)]
*  Emmanuel Macron on the other hand, looked like he wanted to shut down, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=50.0s)]
*  but then he realized he had to walk down the stairs of the plane. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=54.0s)]
*  Could you imagine, you're the head of state, that awful, whatever that was happens, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=57.0s)]
*  and you turn and look and you realize there is a press corps standing there, watching. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=63.0s)]
*  Well, that's the best for people who have watched this video, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=68.0s)]
*  where Brigitte Macron clearly smacks Emmanuel Macron as he's about to get off this plane in Vietnam. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=70.0s)]
*  And the funniest thing is when he realizes that the cameras caught it, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=75.0s)]
*  because he ducks out of the way, and then he pops back out like, hey. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=78.0s)]
*  This is terrible. And I think they tried to lie about it and say it wasn't true, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=84.0s)]
*  and then they were like, oh, it was a friendly dip. I don't know, man. Not great. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=88.0s)]
*  A little karma coming back to the colonizer there in Vietnam. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=92.0s)]
*  I mean, that's kind of what went through my nerdy mind. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=96.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's fair. Also, just have your arguments before you land, I guess, would be a point too. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=98.0s)]
*  We have a great show for you today. We're going to talk, go deep, on the international corruption [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=104.0s)]
*  that is driving so much policy behind the Trump administration. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=109.0s)]
*  We're going to give you a quick recap of Trump's crypto bribe dinner. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=112.0s)]
*  Sounds like a good time, Ben. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=115.0s)]
*  We'll talk about a major restructuring of the national security staff [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=116.0s)]
*  and reports that the administration is pausing all student visas. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=119.0s)]
*  Then we'll talk about the horrible murder of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=122.0s)]
*  the bizarre origins of an almost certainly disastrous new plan to distribute humanitarian aid in Gaza, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=126.0s)]
*  the latest chapter in the ongoing saga of Putin making a mockery of Trump's peace efforts in Ukraine, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=133.0s)]
*  why North Korea's Navy is having a rough week. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=139.0s)]
*  Japan's rice crisis and more. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=141.0s)]
*  And Ben, you'll hear my interview with Congressman Jim Himes from Connecticut. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=143.0s)]
*  He's the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=146.0s)]
*  We talk about Tulsi Gabbard and her firing intelligence officials who won't change their views for political reasons. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=149.0s)]
*  We talked about this weird report in The Guardian this morning that a Pentagon leak investigation [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=155.0s)]
*  ordered by Pete Hexf might be based on an illegal NSA wiretap. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=159.0s)]
*  A little alarming there. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=162.0s)]
*  Yeah, good time to have him on for that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=163.0s)]
*  We talked about how the war in Gaza is fueling extremist groups that threaten America and a lot more. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=165.0s)]
*  It's fun to do just like a tour of the region with someone who's pretty well read into a lot of information. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=170.0s)]
*  And no lack of Intel adjacent stories here. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=174.0s)]
*  No, no, right on. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=178.0s)]
*  There's a lot going on. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=179.0s)]
*  All right, then. So listeners to this show know that we believe that corruption is kind of the first, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=180.0s)]
*  second and third most important story of this administration. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=187.0s)]
*  It's the thing driving it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=189.0s)]
*  Yeah, we've definitely been on that beat. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=190.0s)]
*  It's a rich beat. There's a lot of avenues to cover. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=192.0s)]
*  So the New York Times reported out a bunch of new details about just one piece of the corruption pie that I think was really instructive [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=196.0s)]
*  in terms of helping listeners understand how the grift works and what the impact is on our national interest. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=203.0s)]
*  So here's the gist. So last week, Eric Trump, he went to Vietnam for a groundbreaking ceremony for a one point five billion dollar golf development project. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=208.0s)]
*  The plan includes villas, 36 holes of golf. There's theme parks. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=216.0s)]
*  There's a big commercial zone. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=221.0s)]
*  The Times reported that they erected a tent for a groundbreaking ceremony that had a golden facade. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=223.0s)]
*  That was a nice, a gaudy touch. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=230.0s)]
*  So according to this report, Vietnam has ignored at least a half dozen legally required steps in the development process to fast track what is usually a two to four year process in just three months to accommodate Eric Trump's travel schedule. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=232.0s)]
*  The Times says that Vietnamese officials both publicly and privately say they hope this golf project will be seen as a gesture of goodwill to help help them build better ties with the U.S. and with Trump. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=246.0s)]
*  Ben, this is one of my favorite details. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=255.0s)]
*  Last week, we talked about Trump flipping out on the president of South Africa about a law that allows the South African government to expropriate land from farmers without compensation. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=257.0s)]
*  This story says that the Trump company is pushing ahead with this golf project in Vietnam that will displace hundreds of farmers who were told that they at best should expect to get about half the value of their land in compensation. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=266.0s)]
*  So he's doing exactly what he claims is a problem in South Africa. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=279.0s)]
*  And this isn't the only project. There's also a skyscraper going on in Vietnam. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=283.0s)]
*  And so the point is, like these foreign officials, they do not see any distinction between Trump's business interests and U.S. interests, nor should they. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=287.0s)]
*  Right. And it's sort of like that's the whole deal. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=293.0s)]
*  And this is also happening all over the world. Just a couple of examples. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=295.0s)]
*  There's a half a billion dollar hotel project in Oman, a half a billion dollar Trump Tower in Jeddah, another half a billion dollar tower in Riyadh. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=298.0s)]
*  There is a half a billion dollar Trump Tower in Dubai, a three billion dollar golf and villa project in Qatar. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=305.0s)]
*  That was just announced in April. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=311.0s)]
*  There's nearly two billion worth of development happening in India. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=313.0s)]
*  One point four billion. That's the Jared Kushner Hotel in Albania. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=316.0s)]
*  There is a five hundred million dollar hotel project in Serbia. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=320.0s)]
*  This doesn't even get into like all the money the Saudis are pouring into the Trump properties here by hosting golf tournaments. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=323.0s)]
*  So then it's a little like tedious to go through all of this. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=327.0s)]
*  But I just thought, you know, it's critical for everyone to understand the kind of like the mindset of these foreign officials who are who think their focus right now is on putting money in Trump's pocket. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=331.0s)]
*  It's not about like constructing deals that would normally be viewed as being in the U.S. interests or advancing U.S. policies. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=342.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think what's hard for people understandably is that we're accustomed to corruption being something that a politician kind of skims off the top. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=349.0s)]
*  Right. You know, like you get a side payment or even in Trump's first term, like, well, you know, they're they're staying in his hotel rooms and that kind of pads the bottom line. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=362.0s)]
*  And and I think where this is different is that the corruption itself is the entire point of the enterprise. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=371.0s)]
*  It's not like an add on. Right. It's actually the foundation of the entire president. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=376.0s)]
*  That's why Eric went to Vietnam. Yeah. And because to give you an example of this, if you take this Vietnam piece, Trump puts 46 percent tariffs on Vietnam and then he pauses it. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=381.0s)]
*  And in the pause, they don't agree to, you know, buy a certain amount of American products or I don't know, whatever the thing is that that might in some way benefit Americans. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=394.0s)]
*  They agree to do this. They agree to put a billion plus dollars in the Trump Organization. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=408.0s)]
*  And that's the point. It's using the policy of the United States, in this case, tariffs to extract an enormous amount of money in the context of like an individual company like the Trump Organization. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=414.0s)]
*  And that that's how it works. And so no Americans benefit. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=427.0s)]
*  I mean, like, what is so outrageous about this is, you know, Trump supporters are like, well, he needed to give himself leverage. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=432.0s)]
*  Right. Trump is finally leveraging our status in the global economy to get a better deal. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=437.0s)]
*  He's just leveraging things Americans built. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=443.0s)]
*  Like the reason that America has a huge economy and leverage is not because of anything Donald Trump did. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=446.0s)]
*  It's because of what generations of Americans did. And he's just leveraging it to get money, to just get money plowed in the Trump Organization. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=450.0s)]
*  The second point is these are all kind of autocratic countries. Right. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=458.0s)]
*  I mean, I noticed you didn't say, you know, the UK or Canada or, you know, Botswana. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=463.0s)]
*  Right. These are rich, autocratic countries where they can do this, where they can basically, you know what, how are we going to deal with Trump? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=472.0s)]
*  We're just going to throw like a billion here, two billion here and just kind of get through this for years with all of our interests taken care of. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=479.0s)]
*  It's not a lot of money to them. I mean, it's a lot to Vietnam. But for Qatar, Saudi Arabia, this is nothing. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=485.0s)]
*  There's a routing area. Right. And the last thing is that like Vietnam is an important country. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=491.0s)]
*  It's a really important country. It's a big country in Southeast Asia that is like kind of a swing country between the US and China. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=497.0s)]
*  And we're just treating it like a piggy bank for the Trump Organization. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=505.0s)]
*  And so there's something so diminishing about it for the United States that we're now just another thuggish autocratic country playing by these rules in ways that don't serve our own people. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=509.0s)]
*  But like it is ultimately fundamentally what this presidency is clearly animated by. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=521.0s)]
*  Yeah. And to a lesser extent, this is happening on behalf of Elon Musk and Starlink. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=527.0s)]
*  Like ProPublica had a piece out about how the Trump administration is pushing countries to make deals with Starlink, the Elon Musk satellite internet company. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=531.0s)]
*  And that includes putting extreme pressure on very poor countries in Africa like Gambia, where according to this report by ProPublica, the local telecom infrastructure is like 20 percent of all tax revenue for the country. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=539.0s)]
*  And it's a huge source of jobs and infrastructure. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=553.0s)]
*  So if Starlink puts the local telecom companies out of business, that's a huge problem. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=556.0s)]
*  But also, even if Starlink is better or cheaper or faster and a good deal for people in the country, if it becomes the only game in town, they all know that Elon can then jack up the price or threaten to pull out or do all the shit he did to Ukraine in the days of the war. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=561.0s)]
*  So like it's like sure they're advancing a U.S. business, but doing so in a way that's like predatory. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=577.0s)]
*  And they're advancing. And this is a common thread with Trump, despite what he says about bringing jobs back to the industrial Midwest. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=584.0s)]
*  That's not happening, first of all. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=592.0s)]
*  None of these U.S. businesses are like broadly benefiting American people. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=595.0s)]
*  So first of all, you and I think it's grotesque that we treat foreign countries like this and foreign publics and the same. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=602.0s)]
*  Gambia will kill USAID, will mess up their economy, but will care about Starlink. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=609.0s)]
*  But the thing is, like even these deals he's announcing, right? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=613.0s)]
*  So that that big deal we talked about last week, the AI deal in the Gulf, there's not like the open AI, Starlink. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=616.0s)]
*  These are not countries that are opening like the assembly line in Michigan. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=627.0s)]
*  Right. It's going to benefit a small group of really rich donors and investors. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=633.0s)]
*  Yeah. How many people work for Starlink? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=637.0s)]
*  I mean, it's certainly not like GM back in the day, right? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=639.0s)]
*  And so that's what's so like even further maddening is that even when he can kind of say he's going to bat for some U.S. company, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=643.0s)]
*  he tallies up some huge number because I also don't believe the investment numbers. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=650.0s)]
*  The Saudis will say that we're going to invent, you know, we're going to invest five hundred billion dollars in the U.S. economy. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=655.0s)]
*  No, they're not. They're going to invest a lot of money in AI in the Gulf, you know. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=661.0s)]
*  And yes, some of that money is going to be invested in U.S. companies, but it's going to pad the bottom line of like Sam Altman. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=666.0s)]
*  It's not going to like benefit broad-based prosperity in this country. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=671.0s)]
*  And this is this is where the gap between like the division and the Democratic Party between foreign and domestic kind of messaging is got to go away [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=676.0s)]
*  because you cannot explain to Trump people, their voters, why they're being screwed by Trump without explaining this stuff to them, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=685.0s)]
*  that he's basically leveraging the entire power of the United States to enrich himself and a very small number of people at their expense. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=693.0s)]
*  Yeah. Who are his donors? Yeah. And also, yeah, those golf investment numbers, they're completely made up. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=700.0s)]
*  Like they're not going to do a trillion dollars. No, they're not. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=704.0s)]
*  They want to give him the press release and then they'll do whatever they do. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=707.0s)]
*  Also, interestingly, Ben, I saw the BYD, which is a big Chinese electric vehicle company. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=710.0s)]
*  They're kind of going hard at Elon now. They cut prices by 34 percent. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=716.0s)]
*  So they're going to try to just kill Tesla sales in China, the Middle East and Europe. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=720.0s)]
*  So it seems like maybe you could imagine a scenario where the Chinese are working with them to create some leverage of their own. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=724.0s)]
*  And you could imagine a scenario where, again, this stuff doesn't become manifest like tomorrow. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=732.0s)]
*  Right. So it's not like, oh, my God, all of a sudden the whole global economy is rewiring away from the United States. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=736.0s)]
*  But these are the kinds of things that are happening on a daily basis. Right. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=741.0s)]
*  People are like buying different cars. People are adjusting their supply chains. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=745.0s)]
*  You think that Vietnam is going to use the golf course to get Trump off its back, then it's probably going to cut a bunch of trade deals with China. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=750.0s)]
*  And so Trump gets to look like strong, like I, you know, I believe they can still come up with some other thing. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=757.0s)]
*  They'll say that they're going to buy more rice from the US. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=763.0s)]
*  But what they want, what the Trump administration wants is for Vietnam to crack down on Chinese companies that are basically using them as a middleman. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=766.0s)]
*  They're not going to export Chinese products into the US. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=774.0s)]
*  Right. Right. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=776.0s)]
*  Does anybody believe that they're and by the way, the people in the US, this is important, it kind of sets up some stuff. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=778.0s)]
*  We'll talk about the NSC later. The people in the US government who have to be expert enough to follow the commercial behavior and practices of Vietnam over a period of years to determine if they're a pass through for Chinese goods. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=784.0s)]
*  They all got dozed. Right. Like there's no experts in the government to even do the things that they they use this language to justify what they're doing. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=796.0s)]
*  But what they're doing is for entirely different purposes. Yeah. Good luck. Big balls. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=804.0s)]
*  Yeah, big balls is not like you could evaluate the inputs into certain Vietnamese products. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=807.0s)]
*  Yeah, cotton from Xinjiang with like pig with slave labor. Yeah, good luck. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=812.0s)]
*  So the other piece you guys know that Ben and I are obsessed with is the crypto piece. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=815.0s)]
*  So last week, Trump hosted a dinner for 220 of the biggest buyers of his meme coin. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=818.0s)]
*  This was at his golf club in Virginia. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=823.0s)]
*  The top 25 biggest buyers got to attend a private reception and a guided tour, I believe of the White House itself. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=825.0s)]
*  NBC News reported that the attendees spent a combined one hundred and forty eight million dollars to be there. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=831.0s)]
*  And remember that in addition to Trump's family holding about 80 percent of the Trump coin supply, they get paid fees every time it's bought or sold. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=838.0s)]
*  And the estimate is that they've made more than three hundred and twenty four million dollars on meme meme coin trading fees alone. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=847.0s)]
*  So the event itself sounded like a weird combination of like shitty, ostentatious and douchey like Lamar Odom was there for some reason. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=854.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=862.0s)]
*  An attendee told NBC News that he saw 16 people wearing Richard Millay, Richard Milley watch. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=863.0s)]
*  I had to Google what that is. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=870.0s)]
*  Apparently, these watches cost at least 60 grand and up to several million dollars. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=871.0s)]
*  So it was just like that kind of guy. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=875.0s)]
*  The number one holder of Trump coin is a Chinese crypto CEO named Justin Sun, who we've talked about. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=877.0s)]
*  He's openly been buying Trump's crypto offerings to make an SEC investigation of his company go away. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=882.0s)]
*  Bloomberg, the foreign policy piece of this event is Bloomberg estimates that all but six of the top Trump coin holders are foreign nationalists. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=887.0s)]
*  They're foreigners pouring money into his pocket. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=896.0s)]
*  So, again, like it's so the corruption is so brazen and massive that it feels like we're kind of screaming into the void. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=899.0s)]
*  It did make me happy, though, to learn that Trump only showed up for 23 minutes, that he didn't talk with anyone, that he didn't take any pictures. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=906.0s)]
*  One attendee told NBC News that the food sucked and the only drinks offered were water and Trump wine. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=913.0s)]
*  And this guy apparently was he told the NBC that he was driven to the event by his dad in the Lamborghini, which is a weird thing. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=918.0s)]
*  That guy was hopped up on ketamine. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=924.0s)]
*  Yeah. Or something. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=926.0s)]
*  I just need water. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=927.0s)]
*  Also, Ben, since this event, the price of Trump coin has tanked. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=928.0s)]
*  It went from $16 on Thursday to $12.85 when I wrote that sentence today. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=932.0s)]
*  Tonight, Tuesday, May 27th, JD Vance is headlining a political fundraiser in Vegas for Trump's Super PAC. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=938.0s)]
*  The guess how much it cost to attend for the Super PAC? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=944.0s)]
*  Ten thousand dollars. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=948.0s)]
*  One million dollars. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=949.0s)]
*  I'm glad this time I lowballed that member on the executive orders. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=953.0s)]
*  I had balled it. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=955.0s)]
*  I just want you to imagine for a second. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=956.0s)]
*  You go to a Las Vegas, you spend a million dollars and your boys are like, what you do? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=958.0s)]
*  And you're like, I saw JD Vance fucking. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=963.0s)]
*  Yeah, dog. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=965.0s)]
*  This is the night before the Bitcoin 2025 conference. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=966.0s)]
*  Don Jr. is there. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=968.0s)]
*  Eric David Sakswell there. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=969.0s)]
*  It's just like it's like it's this it's the same core group of people. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=970.0s)]
*  Yeah, look, this is grotesque. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=974.0s)]
*  It's the most open form of corruption because they buy design have deregulated. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=977.0s)]
*  And again, people should know they basically. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=982.0s)]
*  They basically neutered the SEC from investigating any crypto. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=984.0s)]
*  So there's no government oversight of anything that happens in the crypto space. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=988.0s)]
*  It's wild west. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=991.0s)]
*  They can do whatever they want. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=992.0s)]
*  These crypto people think their interests overlaid with Trump's. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=993.0s)]
*  They don't because they're making a mockery of crypto. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=996.0s)]
*  They're just kind of showing what utter fucking bullshit these people in the crypto space [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=998.0s)]
*  spend years telling us is bad, like anti authoritarianism and everything. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1002.0s)]
*  No, it is the ultimate form of authoritarianism, the ability to be this corrupt and pay [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1006.0s)]
*  powerful people to get what you want. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1011.0s)]
*  And that's all that's happening. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1013.0s)]
*  But so there should be a fucking reckoning, by the way, like if I'm the Democrats, like [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1015.0s)]
*  one of the things I'm doing is I'm keeping score. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1020.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1022.0s)]
*  And look, we'll be lucky enough that we have an election in three years. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1023.0s)]
*  But I mean this like instead of being worried about the crypto people dumping some money [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1026.0s)]
*  on you like they did to Sherrod Brown, other Democrat politicians, I think it's got to [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1030.0s)]
*  be the opposite. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1034.0s)]
*  It's got to be like we are going to break these fucking people. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1035.0s)]
*  We're going to regulate the shit out of this bullshit financial instrument. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1038.0s)]
*  The Trump coin, Trump coins worth zero point zero zero. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1041.0s)]
*  It's worth nothing. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1044.0s)]
*  It doesn't exist in the world. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1045.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1046.0s)]
*  So that pisses me off. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1047.0s)]
*  Then we talked about how this is just further undermining the dollar to creating parallel [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1049.0s)]
*  financial systems undermines the currency that most Americans have to use, which is [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1054.0s)]
*  the dollar. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1058.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1059.0s)]
*  And you're creating companies that provide bank like services without the regulations [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1060.0s)]
*  that protect you with banks. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1063.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1064.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1065.0s)]
*  I mean, this if you think there's not going to be some bubble, I mean, this is how you [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1066.0s)]
*  get depressions. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1070.0s)]
*  Look, I don't like big banks either. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1071.0s)]
*  But if you think the dude driving his daddy's Lambo with a million dollar watch is going [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1073.0s)]
*  to like take good care of your investments, like you get the wrong idea. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1078.0s)]
*  Just look at the people walking into that dinner and tell me that you trust those people [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1082.0s)]
*  with anything other than being extras on the next season of White Lotus. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1086.0s)]
*  OK, then you see the story about the new D.C. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1090.0s)]
*  Club for like the Magaloozer's. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1093.0s)]
*  It cost five hundred grand to get in. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1094.0s)]
*  I thought you'd love this. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1096.0s)]
*  David Sachs is like a founding member or investor or something. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1097.0s)]
*  And this is a quote I think attributed to him in The New Yorker. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1100.0s)]
*  We wanted to create something new, HIPAA, in Trump aligned. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1103.0s)]
*  It was described as a sanctuary where members won't have to encounter, quote, a fake news [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1106.0s)]
*  reporter or anyone else. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1110.0s)]
*  Quote, We don't know and we don't trust these losers who are just building bunkers for themselves [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1111.0s)]
*  that cost half a million dollars. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1116.0s)]
*  I want to speak directly to our audience, Sami. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1118.0s)]
*  And I want to say this to you. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1120.0s)]
*  You're all probably listening. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1121.0s)]
*  This is horrible. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1122.0s)]
*  I want to assure you that no amount of money, no amount of crypto grift is going to fill [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1123.0s)]
*  the deep and bottomless hole in all of these people's souls. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1132.0s)]
*  Like these are like Eric Trump is not going to be a happy person who receives the love [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1136.0s)]
*  and intimacy that he's longed for since childhood. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1142.0s)]
*  That hug because the Vietnamese built a tent for him with gold on it. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1146.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1149.0s)]
*  The guy whose dad drives the Lambo is not going to prove his business chops because [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1150.0s)]
*  he like purchase. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1157.0s)]
*  Like these people are not like this is not the path. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1158.0s)]
*  You know, like not to get all serious. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1162.0s)]
*  But like I honestly I just think this is just like people like David Sacks is someone who's [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1164.0s)]
*  so clearly hungers to be taken seriously. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1170.0s)]
*  And and he's just behaving like a like a high school 17 year old who got to control [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1174.0s)]
*  the seating chart at lunch one day. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1181.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1183.0s)]
*  Maybe the punishment is them creating a club where they all have to hang out. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1184.0s)]
*  Just just so we can do a little equal opportunity criticism. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1186.0s)]
*  I did just want to offer a quick boo and hiss to Senator Cory Booker for voting to confirm [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1189.0s)]
*  Charles Kushner to be the U.S. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1195.0s)]
*  Ambassador to France. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1196.0s)]
*  Those who don't know Charles Kushner is Jared Kushner's daddy. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1197.0s)]
*  He went to jail after pleading guilty in 2005 to 18 counts including tax evasion, illegal [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1200.0s)]
*  campaign contributions and witness tampering. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1206.0s)]
*  He had hired a sex worker to seduce his own brother-in-law, had their tryst secretly recorded [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1208.0s)]
*  and then sent the tape to his own sister to try to intimidate a witness. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1214.0s)]
*  Booker claims he voted for Charles Kushner because of the family's work on criminal justice. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1218.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1222.0s)]
*  Seems far more likely it's because they've been longtime friends and donors. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1223.0s)]
*  But like this this is not a person who should be representing the United States at any mission. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1226.0s)]
*  I don't care if it's like a fake, you know, ambassador job where you're not doing high [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1229.0s)]
*  stakes diplomacy. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1234.0s)]
*  Like this is embarrassing for the United States. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1235.0s)]
*  And embarrassing for the Democratic Party. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1237.0s)]
*  And like Cory Booker, it's frustrating because on the one end he can stand up for like 29 [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1239.0s)]
*  hours and whatever it was and show that he gets it. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1244.0s)]
*  And the other end does this that makes it seem like he doesn't get it at all. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1247.0s)]
*  You know, like once you put a stamp of approval and normalization on any of this stuff or [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1250.0s)]
*  if you look like, well, I'm just going to vote this way because this guy was a donor [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1256.0s)]
*  and give you some line about, you know, how he is a champion of criminal justice reform. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1260.0s)]
*  Like then you look no different than the other side. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1265.0s)]
*  And again, Cory Booker knows better. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1268.0s)]
*  He's shown that he knows better. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1270.0s)]
*  So he can do better. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1271.0s)]
*  Good guy. Great senator. Terrible vote. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1273.0s)]
*  And not going to give him a pass on it. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1275.0s)]
*  Ben, another big story that happened right before Memorial Day weekend was the Trump [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1277.0s)]
*  administration announced a major restructuring of their national security staff. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1281.0s)]
*  So they're going to cut the size of the NSC from about 350 members to about half of [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1285.0s)]
*  that and then transfer some of the NSC's like authorities to agencies like the State [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1291.0s)]
*  Department or Department of Defense. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1295.0s)]
*  It doesn't sound like most of these people will get fired. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1297.0s)]
*  Most people at the NSC are detailed there by other agencies, so they will likely just [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1299.0s)]
*  return home to the CIA or Department of Defense or wherever they were from. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1303.0s)]
*  But then far more important and interesting to me is it sounds like they are just kind [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1307.0s)]
*  of wholesale doing away with the NSC process. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1312.0s)]
*  So the way that used to work is let's say the president wanted a new approach to dealing [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1315.0s)]
*  with North Korea. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1319.0s)]
*  You would start by having the senior director for Asian Affairs bring together representatives [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1321.0s)]
*  from all the relevant national security agencies. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1325.0s)]
*  They work up proposals when those are ready for prime time. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1328.0s)]
*  They get sent to the deputies committee. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1331.0s)]
*  They convene, meet on it, do a bunch more work. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1333.0s)]
*  And then the deputies send it up to the principals committee. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1336.0s)]
*  That's the cabinet level grouping of the NSC. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1339.0s)]
*  And then the president ultimately has a meeting with his entire national security team where [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1342.0s)]
*  they make changes. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1347.0s)]
*  They green light whatever it is. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1349.0s)]
*  They reject it. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1350.0s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1351.0s)]
*  And yes, maybe that can be a little bureaucratic and slow at times. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1352.0s)]
*  But I would argue that it was a pretty good way to force debate and hard thinking and [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1355.0s)]
*  kind of, I don't know, just a good process. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1360.0s)]
*  Like I actually thought the NSC process should be replicated in other parts of the US [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1362.0s)]
*  government. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1366.0s)]
*  But apparently it's all gone. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1367.0s)]
*  And this quote is from Axios. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1369.0s)]
*  Quote, that's the bottom to the top approach. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1371.0s)]
*  That doesn't work. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1374.0s)]
*  It's going away. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1375.0s)]
*  The senior White House official said all those things feeding up to the principals are the [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1376.0s)]
*  unnecessary piece. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1380.0s)]
*  That same official says that that process might have been needed in the past when there [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1381.0s)]
*  were interagency turf wars. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1385.0s)]
*  But Trump's team all knows each other really well. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1387.0s)]
*  They love each other. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1389.0s)]
*  So that's no longer an issue, according to this person, which is very funny since Mike [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1390.0s)]
*  Waltz, the National Security Adviser, has gotten knifed and pushed out of his job. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1394.0s)]
*  And Pete Hexhath can't seem to win a turf war within his own department. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1398.0s)]
*  But Ben, I mean, what do you think? [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1402.0s)]
*  It just seems like they're setting up all foreign policy to be done by presidential [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1404.0s)]
*  fiat, which maybe is inevitable with Trump. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1409.0s)]
*  But like, I don't know, it just seems destined to end badly. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1411.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1414.0s)]
*  And again, just to build on what you said, like the NSC was a little too big. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1415.0s)]
*  I don't think you need 300 plus people there. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1420.0s)]
*  For us, it was even bigger. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1422.0s)]
*  I was like 500. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1423.0s)]
*  Yeah, it got too big. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1424.0s)]
*  But you focus on the right point, the process, right? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1427.0s)]
*  So the beginning point, before you get to that deputies level, right, you have something [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1429.0s)]
*  called the Interagency Policy Committee, which is usually run by like a senior director at [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1433.0s)]
*  the NSC. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1438.0s)]
*  And that's the person in charge of Europe or Asia or a functional issue like counterterrorism. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1439.0s)]
*  And they coordinate the different agencies. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1443.0s)]
*  And people may say, well, why does the NSC have to do it? [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1445.0s)]
*  Because apparently they're moving that to the State Department. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1447.0s)]
*  Well, actually, because in today's world, like most issues have huge cross-cutting aspect. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1449.0s)]
*  Treasury has to be at the table because there's an economic component, right? [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1456.0s)]
*  The intelligence community is usually at that table. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1460.0s)]
*  The military has to be at the table. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1462.0s)]
*  There's a military equity. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1463.0s)]
*  There are some countries where the Commerce Department has to be there, technologies involved. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1465.0s)]
*  And the point is that only the White House can coordinate and facilitate, as you said, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1469.0s)]
*  this kind of debate and bottom up expertise that informs policy. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1473.0s)]
*  And they're just doing away with that. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1479.0s)]
*  I don't think, by the way, they're clearly not trying to empower the State Department. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1481.0s)]
*  No. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1485.0s)]
*  Because they're in the process of just destroying the State Department, too. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1486.0s)]
*  They're chasing people out of the State Department. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1489.0s)]
*  They're firing people. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1491.0s)]
*  They're elevating ideologues in their 20s. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1493.0s)]
*  So the two things I take away from this are, your point, they basically want Trump to be [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1497.0s)]
*  they basically want Trump to decide what he cares and Steve Witkoff and a small number of people. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1502.0s)]
*  And then the US government is just this kind of instrument to act on Trump's, the announcement he wants to make [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1508.0s)]
*  or the trip he wants to take. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1513.0s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1515.0s)]
*  That is very dangerous because it's also how you make just massive mistakes. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1516.0s)]
*  I mean, I've been doing some like Vietnam reading again. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1521.0s)]
*  This is how we get into Vietnam, right? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1524.0s)]
*  Nobody listened to the experts out in the government who were like, hey, this is not actually like a communist movement. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1526.0s)]
*  It's a nationalist movement in Vietnam. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1531.0s)]
*  Well, you know, it would have been good to listen to those people. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1533.0s)]
*  There will be things where they wish that they had like listened to experts because it gets them in trouble. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1535.0s)]
*  Or like pre-Iraq war when nobody knew the difference between a Sunni and a Shiite. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1540.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1543.0s)]
*  Might have been good to run that one down. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1544.0s)]
*  Yeah. You want those people. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1545.0s)]
*  But the other thing that I take away from it, Tommy, is that they just probably don't give a shit about 90 percent of the world. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1546.0s)]
*  Because a lot of the stuff that really runs through the NSC is actually the kind of, you know, what is our relationship with like Indonesia, like a big important country? [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1554.0s)]
*  We need some people sitting thinking about how we like selling more stuff, making trade agreements, like trying to get Indonesians to see things our way in Asia. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1564.0s)]
*  Like the president doesn't get involved in that, but you want someone at the NSC coordinating everybody. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1572.0s)]
*  They care so little about most of the world that this means I think we're just actually going to be absent from most of the world, too. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1577.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I think they also view this in terms of just power structures and that the NSC, if it was strong, would compete with people over in the West Wing like, you know, Stephen Miller, Susan Wiles and other political hacks. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1585.0s)]
*  And also they just view every like non personally vetted human being in the building as a risk of leaking. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1596.0s)]
*  You know, like the Alexander Vindman kind of whistleblowing. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1606.0s)]
*  They just think that that's what the NSC is. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1610.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I do think that I'm glad you mentioned Stephen Miller, because I think he's actually a key part of this. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1612.0s)]
*  I think he is kind of a shadow national security adviser. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1617.0s)]
*  And Trump said he was more powerful. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1620.0s)]
*  So he doesn't want to manage a staff of 250 people. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1622.0s)]
*  He wants like a rump group of loyalists at the NSC. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1625.0s)]
*  And really, you're right. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1629.0s)]
*  It's the decisions are Trump, Miller, Witkoff, you know, maybe they'll let Suzy Wiles in the room every now and then. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1631.0s)]
*  A handful of other people. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1638.0s)]
*  And actually, it's instead of a staffing, a resource to him. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1639.0s)]
*  It's either something to be afraid of, as you said, or it's just like a burden. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1643.0s)]
*  I mean, we have to go through the process. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1647.0s)]
*  I want to like I want to do something tomorrow. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1649.0s)]
*  I don't want to go through a week. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1651.0s)]
*  Yeah. One other thing from the Trump world we want to talk about, Ben. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1653.0s)]
*  So Politico is reporting that the Trump administration has ordered U.S. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1656.0s)]
*  embassies to pause scheduling interviews for student visa applications and that they are weighing requiring all students to undergo social media vetting. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1660.0s)]
*  This seems like it's just an extension of the Trump administration's effort to punish anyone who has been critical of the war in Gaza. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1670.0s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1678.0s)]
*  I mean, these are these were early reports. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1679.0s)]
*  I'm not sure that this is enacted yet. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1681.0s)]
*  It sounds like this is part of a cable that Rubio sent out on Tuesday. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1684.0s)]
*  I think this would be enormously damaging to the U.S. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1689.0s)]
*  If we stopped being a place where all the smartest people in the fucking world want to go to college and potentially move and live and start businesses and create economic value. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1692.0s)]
*  But also, Ben, just a huge congrats to Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk and all the tech geniuses who voted for Trump to get us free speech and to get him to prioritize the top performing immigrants for their software engineering roles. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1703.0s)]
*  I think that's going really great. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1716.0s)]
*  Congrats to you guys. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1718.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is another one of these things. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1720.0s)]
*  Even if they don't do the worst version of the rule, like if you are a foreign student thinking about where you want to go to school next year, why would you try coming here? [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1723.0s)]
*  Especially if you're Muslim or you're brown or black. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1734.0s)]
*  We have anything on social media that is critical of Trump or free Palestine or whatever the thing is. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1737.0s)]
*  And so we won't know. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1744.0s)]
*  I'm very curious. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1748.0s)]
*  Calendar year, next academic year, I think we're going to see this precipitous drop in foreign students, no matter what Trump does, because they've made it look so miserable and dangerous to be here or to get here. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1750.0s)]
*  The irony of this whole thing is that Trump's whole tantrum about terraces, about trade deficits. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1761.0s)]
*  There's almost I can't think of any industries that is more of a net trade surplus for the United States in higher education. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1767.0s)]
*  Over a million foreign students come here every year and put a tremendous amount, tens of billions of dollars into the U.S. economy. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1774.0s)]
*  So that's before you even get into their capabilities. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1781.0s)]
*  Then, as you said, these people tend to be some of the best and brightest from their countries coming here to do research here that benefits Americans and American universities and American research institutes and American companies. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1784.0s)]
*  They're going to go someplace else. They're going to China. They're going to golf. They're going to go to Europe. They're going to go to India. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1795.0s)]
*  Like that is going to have a long term consequence on the United States at the same time, by the way, that they're getting with the Department of Education. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1800.0s)]
*  So they're trying to make Americans dumber. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1808.0s)]
*  So we're not going to be able to patch the gaps in our own education system with foreign students or legal immigration. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1810.0s)]
*  So this thing is like not a secondary issue. It's like a headline issue because if we cease to be the destination for international students, it's both going to be a massive economic hit, but it's going to be a huge long term hit to the United States as a research and innovation hub for the world. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1815.0s)]
*  Yeah. And remember that, you know, as part of his effort to court all these kind of like MAGA curious tech bros, Trump went on the All In podcast in June of 2024, and he told them that we should make it easier for international students who graduate from top US colleges to become citizens. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1831.0s)]
*  Derek Thompson resurfaced this quote the other day. Here's what Trump said. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1849.0s)]
*  He said, it's so sad when we lose people from Harvard after they graduate. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1853.0s)]
*  He said, I think you should automatically get as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1857.0s)]
*  That is going to end on day one. And so all the all the, you know, Chamath was like, that's fantastic. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1862.0s)]
*  David Sachs like, that's great. They assumed they had like, you know, high skill, piled Trump when it comes to immigration. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1867.0s)]
*  And now he's just doing the exact opposite. He is driving the smartest and best performing students away from the United States. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1875.0s)]
*  Great work. Yeah. Which which will just be I mean, like, you know, so much of our history, you know, would Einstein come here today? [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1881.0s)]
*  He'll keep looking. He'd be checking other places, you know, and that he was a student. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1888.0s)]
*  But the number of people that came here to do work, to study, to research is incalculable. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1891.0s)]
*  The economic benefit that that's the United States. And for Trump, there's such a corrupt short-termism that this is really important to contrast with his quote unquote gold card. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1898.0s)]
*  Remember, you like talking about selling five million dollars for a gold card? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1908.0s)]
*  Well, that's like some oligarch from Russia or some some Saudi prince or something that can just make a one time payment of five million dollars. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1912.0s)]
*  I would much rather have the kind of lifelong relationship you develop with a national student who comes here, creates things here, builds things here, found things here. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1921.0s)]
*  Look who runs tech companies in this country. Right. So many of them are immigrants. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1929.0s)]
*  And this is just massive, massive cell phone. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1934.0s)]
*  Imagine if Einstein was in your class. So next to that guy, you know, cheat off that homework. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1937.0s)]
*  Yeah. I understand. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=1941.0s)]
*  Not even for a second. If you want to fight the monsters behind all these terrible policies, Ben, on June 6th, John Lovett is teaming up with the Bullworks Tim Miller and Sarah Longwell for free Andre, which is a fundraiser at World Pride hosted by Crooked Media and the Bullwork at the Lincoln Theatre in Washington, D.C.

*  Alright Ben, so we wanted to talk first about the horrific shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in DC last week. Yaron Lashinsky and Sarah Milgram were a young couple leaving an event at the Capitol Jewish Museum when they were shot by someone named Elias Rodriguez who told the police, quote, I did it for Palestine. I did it for Gaza. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2171.0s)]
*  US officials are investigating this crime as both a hate crime and as an act of terrorism. Just wanted to say this is fucking evil. It's unjustifiable. Obviously this person thinks he did it for Palestine. I think it's pretty much unequivocally true that it will set back the movement to end this war and that extrajudicial vigilante violence is stupid and we should not celebrate the people who do it. I don't care if you think Luigi's fucking hot and has great abs. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2187.0s)]
*  Or you think a cause is righteous. Not one life is going to be saved because this idiot decided to shoot people in Washington DC. I also don't think that we as liberals and democrats are going to win an escalating war of vigilante violence. So it's just a horrific story. Absolutely tragic. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2216.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a it's the worst possible thing for the cause too that he claimed to be representing. I mean, so it's first and foremost a human tragedy. Two young people had a whole life in front of them, no longer have that life in front of them. That's like the most important thing. And that's like the horror of what happened. It's also to your point, like vigilante justice. Like this is not this is the worst thing you could do for the thing you claim you care about. You know, so it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2234.0s)]
*  it's wrong. It's stupid. It's horrific for everybody involved. I think that the tragedy of what we're seeing in Gaza, we've had, you know, it's interesting. Like we made some points earlier on in the war, right about Hamas, where we're like, this is a radicalizing violence, right? That essentially like what Israel was doing. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2264.0s)]
*  Was going to further radicalize Hamas over time. That pisses everybody off because because people will say, don't justify what Hamas is going to do in the future by what Israel's doing. That's and then other people say to us, essentially, don't reduce kind of Palestinians to people who can be radicalized because it plays in. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2294.16s)]
*  So I'm naming the awkwardness of the conversation that we're about to kind of have here. I just I'm just saying analytically, like violence tragically tends to beget violence. And none of this is leading anywhere good. It's all the more reason that we want to end all violence. That includes obviously horrific murders like this. But it also includes the war in Gaza itself. It doesn't. And there's a kind of awful discourse where the what's [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2315.44s)]
*  happening in Gaza is no more like right or wrong the day after this happened than it was the day before. And that that you see, unfortunately, social media brain kind of pushes people in those directions. You can accept this as a horrific, evil tragedy that happened and realize that it kind of does not really interact with the horror of what's happening in Gaza and hold those two thoughts at the same time. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2345.44s)]
*  I find it so maybe this is just a social media thing. I don't understand why people can't hold two thoughts in their head at the same time. It's like I think killing innocent civilians is wrong at any point. I don't care whether it's this crazy shooter in D.C. I don't care if it's Hamas. I don't care if it's the IDF. Like you shouldn't just kill innocent people. It's not good. Advance your cause. It's not going to end the suffering that you want to suffer. I talked with Congressman Himes about this horrible combination we're seeing, though, of it's like day after day after day. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2368.24s)]
*  It's like the whole thing is like we're seeing this horrible combination of horrific violence in Gaza coupled with the fact that there is no political track to create a Palestinian state and the hopelessness that creates and what people sometimes do when they feel like they have no hope for a future. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2398.24s)]
*  And that's the only last thing I'd say about this is like to take it to Bibi Netanyahu and the Israeli political leadership that is doing this in Gaza. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2415.4399999999996s)]
*  Israel's safer and Jews safer. This is not doing that. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2423.04s)]
*  You know, and again, that doesn't mean it's right that bad things might happen like this horrific thing that happened. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2427.44s)]
*  It just means that you have to think about the tale of what's happening. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2434.44s)]
*  Gaza is going to be decades, if not hundreds of years. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2439.04s)]
*  It could end up being that scale of event that sticks and just walk back from the precipice. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2443.64s)]
*  You know, they should have done it already. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2450.64s)]
*  But anyway, this that's why I think people feel both the pain of what these young people lost, but also sense of foreboding, you know, that this violence we're tolerating way too much violence around us. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2452.64s)]
*  I mean, I remember talking with with you on the show even in the just early weeks after October 7th, knowing that there was going to be a sustained and absolutely brutal conflict. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2466.24s)]
*  But if you would ask me then whether it would still be just a full scale war, May 27th of 2025, I never would have guessed this has gone on this long. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2477.24s)]
*  And that's partly why you can't even begin to ascertain like the tale of this. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2486.74s)]
*  Well, not even a war really, because I just don't think I don't see much evidence that Hamas is like fighting back. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2490.8399999999997s)]
*  So it's basically like just a killing zone in Gaza, which is going to lead other people to say we're going to fight back in other places. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2495.8399999999997s)]
*  And and and that that's what history shows you doesn't make it right. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2504.8399999999997s)]
*  It just makes it what we learned from history that people will lash out in other in other ways in other places on the ground in Gaza. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2508.8399999999997s)]
*  There is this new Israeli-American plan for humanitarian aid distribution that has created a huge uproar. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2516.94s)]
*  The idea is to replace the UN and other independent and experienced aid organizations with this new organization called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, or we'll call the GHF for short, which only came into existence in February. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2521.94s)]
*  So the GHF is structured to use armed American contractors to secure what they're calling hubs in Gaza through which aid will be distributed. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2533.94s)]
*  Israel claims this plan will prevent Hamas from intercepting aid intended for the civilian population. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2541.94s)]
*  There's currently four hubs, three of which are on the southern end of the strip, which immediately creates a huge logistical problem because most of the population of Gaza is concentrated in north and central Gaza. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2546.04s)]
*  And to get to the hubs in the south, Palestinians are going to have to cross Israeli military lines with no assurances that they will not be shot at, no assurances that they'll be allowed back. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2556.04s)]
*  There's reports today that at least one person trying to get assistance was arrested by Israeli forces, so they're not going to trust this process. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2566.04s)]
*  People on the ground in Gaza and you're asking a starved, battered population to make physically a long trek to get food to survive, which will just be impossible for the elderly, the sick, the disabled, for children. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2573.14s)]
*  In this plan, de facto puts the Israeli government in charge of deciding who gets aid and who does not. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2586.14s)]
*  And it dovetails with Israel's stated claim of displacing the population of Gaza into the southern end of the strip. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2590.14s)]
*  So the GHF has claimed that it has plans for more hubs to be put in place in the north, but nothing about this organization smells right. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2596.24s)]
*  On Sunday, Jake Wood, the executive director of the GHF, he resigned saying in a statement, [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2605.24s)]
*  quote, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2610.3399999999997s)]
*  while also strictly adhering to the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, independence, which I will not abandon. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2613.44s)]
*  He resigned shortly after the New York Times reported that this isn't some neutral independent organization that it was actually first proposed and developed by Israeli officials just a few weeks into the war. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2619.44s)]
*  The Times piece also highlights there's this one American contractor, a former CIA operative named Philip F. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2629.44s)]
*  Riley, whose company Safe Reach Solutions is the primary contact tractor securing the hubs. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2635.44s)]
*  According to the Times, Riley helped train the Contras, right-wing militias fighting Nicaragua's Marxist government back in the 80s. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2641.54s)]
*  He was also the CIA station chief in Kabul after the U.S. invasion. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2647.54s)]
*  And there's also some weirdness around the funding of GHF. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2651.54s)]
*  Like it got seed funding from some non-Israeli businessman and a hundred million dollar donation from an anonymous Western country. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2654.54s)]
*  So like no one knows where this money's coming from. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2661.54s)]
*  So Ben, the operations commence on Monday. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2664.54s)]
*  On Tuesday, there's already reports of Israeli gunfire after crowds of desperate people broke down a fence to get to the aid. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2668.64s)]
*  The IDF is firing warning shots in response. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2674.64s)]
*  This seems like it's just going to be a logistical disaster and it's already a disaster when it comes to trusting this organization's independence. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2678.64s)]
*  Yeah, I actually went down a rabbit hole with this organization, including its branch organizations like SRS, Safe Reach Solutions. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2686.64s)]
*  And then I kind of stopped myself because I'm like, what am I doing here? [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2694.74s)]
*  Because let's take a step back. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2698.74s)]
*  First of all, this is what happens when you wage war on delegitimize attack organizations like UNRWA, organizations that know how to deliver aid. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2700.74s)]
*  It's the same thing that was so dumb about that peer, right? [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2709.74s)]
*  Let's just drive some trucks across the border and give it to the aid professionals and they'll give it to the people. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2712.74s)]
*  Like, you know, I'm not a humanitarian aid specialist, but that seems like better than building a peer. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2717.74s)]
*  Well, in this case, it's even more cynical because if I'm look, I have enough information. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2722.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't think they want to give any aid to people in Gaza. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2727.8399999999997s)]
*  I think they want to be able to say they have a plan to give aid to people. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2729.8399999999997s)]
*  They're going to call it the GHF. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2732.8399999999997s)]
*  They're going to enrich some people who are like private security contractors and not give people aid. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2734.8399999999997s)]
*  And then they're going to kill Palestinians and starve Palestinians and have houses collapse on Palestinians and have them walk and die on the way to get to these things. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2739.8399999999997s)]
*  This is a plan to kill more Palestinians, not to save Palestinians. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2747.8399999999997s)]
*  And like we just have to start like I like I don't know what else to think about these things that keep getting presented to us. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2750.94s)]
*  Because if you're telling me that the rational way to save Palestinians is to make GHF and like pay some fucking goons, you know, in South Southern Gaza, [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2756.94s)]
*  while you're getting rid of unrun, you're getting rid of people actually have the relationships and expertise to feed people. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2767.94s)]
*  I'm not going to give you the benefit of the doubt anymore. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2772.94s)]
*  And they just want talking points to say they have a plan so that they can when they get asked why aren't you giving aid, they can talk about this. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2775.04s)]
*  Like that's I know that's cynical, but I don't know how else to think about it. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2783.04s)]
*  No, I'm not like I have no doubt that Hamas was stealing aid and then reselling it. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2786.04s)]
*  But one way to combat that is to flood the Gaza Strip with enough humanitarian supplies so that the prices aren't astronomical and they can't make a huge profit off of it anymore. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2791.04s)]
*  I also think like long term, this is part of this broader project to undercut the existence of UNRWA, [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2799.14s)]
*  which not only provides humanitarian relief in Gaza, but also fundamentally takes care of Palestinians as they seek the right to return to land where they were displaced from over the past several decades. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2805.14s)]
*  Right. So that that is an ongoing Netanyahu project. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2818.14s)]
*  Also, Ben, you sort of alluded to this earlier. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2821.24s)]
*  People get mad at us in the show when we accuse the Israeli government of war crimes or ethnic cleansing. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2824.24s)]
*  And, you know, it's off. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2830.24s)]
*  You know, I get this all the time on Twitter and shit. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2831.24s)]
*  It's like, oh, it's because you hate Israel or it's because you're an anti-Semite. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2833.24s)]
*  But I think it's harder to make those rejoinders when the person making the allegation is a former Israeli prime minister. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2836.24s)]
*  This is a clip from Ehud Olmert from CNN a couple of days ago. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2844.24s)]
*  Particularly in the last few days was the statements made by Israeli cabinet ministers, the leading cabinet ministers that say we should starve Gaza. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2848.3399999999997s)]
*  What is it if not a war crime? [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2858.3399999999997s)]
*  I mean, how can a serious person representing the Israeli government can spell it out in such an explicit manner that we should starve Gaza, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2860.3399999999997s)]
*  that there should be no supply of basic fundamental humanitarian needs to a couple of millions of people living there. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2872.44s)]
*  There are terrorists that we need to fight, but this is not a war against Hamas. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2881.44s)]
*  This looks more and more like a political war of the Israeli prime minister in the cabinet and the group of thugs, [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2890.44s)]
*  which are now representing the Israeli government inside Israel and across the world are committing actions which can't be interpreted in any other way. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2898.54s)]
*  It's pretty clear. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2908.54s)]
*  Now, he is wildly corrupt. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2910.54s)]
*  He's a convicted criminal, but I think he's telling the truth. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2912.54s)]
*  Well, you know, Bibi would be. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2914.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2916.54s)]
*  And there's something sad about it, like the criticism, because, you know, take UNRWA. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2918.54s)]
*  There are people, I think, in the Israeli government that went UNRWA out of the way for the reasons you said, [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2922.54s)]
*  that they're too tied in with the Palestinians. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2927.64s)]
*  Their existence legitimizes the idea that there's such a thing as a Palestinian refugee, [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2930.64s)]
*  which means that that person has a home that they're supposed to return to. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2937.64s)]
*  But then what they do is they take the people in the United States. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2939.64s)]
*  They say they go, all these people are Hamas, and they're all terrorists, and it's not safe for them to give out the aid. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2943.64s)]
*  And you have, by the way, we've talked to some of these people, and they're nice European people, right? [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2951.64s)]
*  And then you get these people online who think, genuinely believe, that we're idiots. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2956.74s)]
*  You don't understand UNRWA's terrorists. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2962.74s)]
*  They have no fucking idea what they're talking about. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2964.74s)]
*  Like, what do you know about what you're talking about? [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2966.74s)]
*  You are being used. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2968.74s)]
*  You are being played. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2970.74s)]
*  You are being played in the most cynical way possible, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2971.74s)]
*  because people are telling you that unless you call people like us, anti-Semites, [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2973.74s)]
*  for criticizing the murder of children in Gaza, [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2978.74s)]
*  like we don't understand that UNRWA's full of teething with Hamas. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2981.74s)]
*  You don't know that. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2985.8399999999997s)]
*  You've been told that by people that want you to believe that. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2986.8399999999997s)]
*  There's 13,000 UNRWA employees in Gaza, or at least there were. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2988.8399999999997s)]
*  Is there some subset of that group that hates the Israeli government? [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2992.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2997.8399999999997s)]
*  Certainly. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2998.8399999999997s)]
*  Could they be in Hamas? [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=2999.8399999999997s)]
*  Very, very possible. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3000.8399999999997s)]
*  It also could be that they're extremely angry about being bombed. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3002.8399999999997s)]
*  And that they would really like to just do the job of giving people food. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3005.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3009.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm not excusing any connection between UNRWA employees on October 7th. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3010.8399999999997s)]
*  That should be investigated. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3014.94s)]
*  Those people should be prosecuted. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3015.94s)]
*  I'm sure they're being targeted by the IDF as we speak, if they're still alive. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3016.94s)]
*  But the idea that that makes it okay to cut off the sole means of distributing aid [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3020.94s)]
*  to every single human being in the Gaza Strip is insane. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3025.94s)]
*  And give me a break. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3027.94s)]
*  It's horrible what some people did with UNRWA. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3029.94s)]
*  Are we going to apply the same standard to the IDF? [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3032.94s)]
*  Because one person does something in an organization of 13,000 people [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3034.94s)]
*  and we're all supposed to just banish it from existence. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3039.94s)]
*  Meanwhile, I don't see any accountability on the other side for anything. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3044.04s)]
*  Yeah, I saw a great interview that Feroz did, our guest last week. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3047.04s)]
*  He was on Channel 13, an Israeli very conservative news channel [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3051.04s)]
*  who were kind of making the talking what you always hear about [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3055.04s)]
*  well, the IDF had to bomb a hospital because there was Hamas infrastructure beneath it. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3058.04s)]
*  And he was like, well, Netanyahu had a prostate operation. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3063.04s)]
*  He was in the hospital for a couple of days in Israel, [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3068.04s)]
*  presumably directing the government, making war plans, [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3071.14s)]
*  making decisions about the conduct of the war. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3075.14s)]
*  Would anyone then argue that that makes that hospital in Israel [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3077.14s)]
*  a legitimate target for Hamas? [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3080.14s)]
*  No, of course not. It only applies in Gaza. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3082.14s)]
*  It only applies one direction. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3084.14s)]
*  A quick update then, just on the Trump incoherent, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3085.14s)]
*  feckless and failed effort to end the war in Ukraine. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3088.14s)]
*  So per usual, there's two core elements. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3090.14s)]
*  The first is Trump complaining on truth social, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3092.14s)]
*  usually mostly about Zelensky or at least more Zelensky than Putin. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3094.14s)]
*  And the second is Russia launching massive airstrikes [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3098.24s)]
*  and massacring civilians in Ukraine. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3101.24s)]
*  Here's a clip of Trump talking to the press [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3103.24s)]
*  about the war in Ukraine and about Putin on Sunday. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3105.24s)]
*  I'm not happy with what Putin's doing. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3108.24s)]
*  He's killing a lot of people and I don't know what the hell happened to Putin. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3110.24s)]
*  I've known him a long time, always gotten along with him. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3114.24s)]
*  We're in the middle of talking and he's shooting rockets into Kiev and other cities. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3117.24s)]
*  I don't like it at all. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3121.24s)]
*  What do you want to do about that? [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3123.24s)]
*  I'm surprised. I'm very surprised. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3125.24s)]
*  We'll see what we're going to do. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3127.3399999999997s)]
*  What am I going to tell you? [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3129.3399999999997s)]
*  You're the fake news, aren't you? [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3131.3399999999997s)]
*  You're totally fake. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3133.3399999999997s)]
*  I don't like what Putin is doing, not even a little bit. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3135.3399999999997s)]
*  He's killing people. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3137.3399999999997s)]
*  And something happened to this guy and I don't like it. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3139.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, Putin. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3141.3399999999997s)]
*  He just started killing people. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3143.3399999999997s)]
*  He just figured this out? [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3145.3399999999997s)]
*  How weak does he look? [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3147.3399999999997s)]
*  I think Russia, right around that time, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3149.3399999999997s)]
*  he was either before or after those comments, [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3151.3399999999997s)]
*  Russia launched its largest ever drone and missile attack on Ukraine. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3153.3399999999997s)]
*  The Ukrainian Air Force said Russia launched more than 350 explosive drones and at least nine cruise missiles. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3155.44s)]
*  Trump then said Putin had gone absolutely crazy. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3161.44s)]
*  That's a quote. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3165.44s)]
*  To which the Kremlin responded that Trump was showing signs of quote, [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3167.44s)]
*  emotional overload. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3169.44s)]
*  But on Tuesday, Trump truth, quote, [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3171.44s)]
*  what Vladimir Putin doesn't realize is that if it weren't for me, [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3173.44s)]
*  lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3175.44s)]
*  I'd like to know what he did. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3177.44s)]
*  So he's like, he's playing with fire. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3179.44s)]
*  So like, it's just, it's just, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3181.44s)]
*  he looks so pathetic there. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3183.54s)]
*  The only good news for the Ukrainians, Ben, [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3185.54s)]
*  is that German Chancellor Friedrich Mertz [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3187.54s)]
*  announced that Germany will give Ukraine the Taurus missiles, [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3189.54s)]
*  that's their long range missile. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3191.54s)]
*  They also announced that the, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3193.54s)]
*  the Ukrainians allies would remove all range restrictions on arms they're supplying. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3195.54s)]
*  I don't, [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3197.54s)]
*  some of the reporting suggested that includes [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3199.54s)]
*  US supplied weapons, [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3201.54s)]
*  which would surprise me that Trump would cream like that, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3203.54s)]
*  but interesting. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3205.54s)]
*  I don't know, but I just, [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3207.54s)]
*  it's just, you made the point, like, [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3209.54s)]
*  Trump is the most thin skinned person in the world. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3211.64s)]
*  He takes every slight so personally, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3213.64s)]
*  and Putin just humiliates him over and over again. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3215.64s)]
*  And I think if there's something that we've learned [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3217.64s)]
*  about Putin's intentions, [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3219.64s)]
*  which is not surprising, is that [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3221.64s)]
*  Putin, you know, some people are like, [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3223.64s)]
*  well, will he see Trump as an opportunity [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3225.64s)]
*  to, you know, work with Trump to kind of get what he wants? [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3227.64s)]
*  Or will he see Trump as an opportunity to completely humiliate the United States? [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3229.64s)]
*  Like, I think he would be more than happy [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3231.64s)]
*  to have done that. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3233.64s)]
*  I think he would be more than happy [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3235.64s)]
*  to have done that. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3237.64s)]
*  I think he would be more than happy [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3239.74s)]
*  to have Donald Trump end up hating him, [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3241.74s)]
*  because Donald Trump is going to prove [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3243.74s)]
*  his point that he's made his whole life. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3245.74s)]
*  These people are corrupt, they're no different than anybody else. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3247.74s)]
*  Look at this fucking guy, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3249.74s)]
*  you want to put him in charge of your security. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3251.74s)]
*  So I think what Putin is doing [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3253.74s)]
*  is intentionally humiliating Trump. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3255.74s)]
*  To both get more land in Ukraine, [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3257.74s)]
*  to get the better deal whenever there is a deal in Ukraine, [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3259.74s)]
*  but also to intentionally make Trump look like a fool. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3261.74s)]
*  And Trump looks like even bigger fool. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3265.74s)]
*  He's like, he can't do that! [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3267.8399999999997s)]
*  And then it's like, what are you going to do about it? [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3269.8399999999997s)]
*  And he's like, fake news! [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3271.8399999999997s)]
*  Screaming at Jeff Mason. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3273.8399999999997s)]
*  Which is funny if you know Jeff Mason. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3275.8399999999997s)]
*  He's like a nice Reuters guy, like a fedora. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3277.8399999999997s)]
*  Anyway, it's just sad. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3279.8399999999997s)]
*  And Ukrainians, you can tell, all their eggs [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3281.8399999999997s)]
*  are in the European basket now. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3283.8399999999997s)]
*  You almost don't see Zelensky [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3285.8399999999997s)]
*  unless he's flanked by like [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3287.8399999999997s)]
*  Donald Tusk, Friedrich Merz, [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3289.8399999999997s)]
*  Emmanuel Macron, and Kyrsten Armer. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3291.8399999999997s)]
*  It's like, you think those guys are like his bodyguards. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3293.8399999999997s)]
*  He's always with the half dozen European leaders. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3295.94s)]
*  No, I think you're exactly right. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3297.94s)]
*  He'll string Trump along, Putin knows that Putin's going to die in office [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3299.94s)]
*  and that Trump will be gone, well, probably be gone in four years. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3301.94s)]
*  And you're right though, over time, [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3303.94s)]
*  the humiliation of Trump [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3305.94s)]
*  becomes the humiliation of the country [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3307.94s)]
*  in a system that could put someone like that in charge. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3309.94s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3311.94s)]
*  So, great work everybody. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3313.94s)]
*  Ben, last week was also a tough time to be a senior leader [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3315.94s)]
*  in the North Korean Navy. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3317.94s)]
*  This comes after a 5,000 ton destroyer [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3319.94s)]
*  capsized at launch, [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3321.94s)]
*  a christening ceremony due to quote, [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3324.04s)]
*  absolute carelessness according to Kim Jong Un [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3326.04s)]
*  who watched it all happen live. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3328.04s)]
*  He also said the wreck quote, [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3330.04s)]
*  brought the dignity and self-respect of our state to a collapse. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3332.04s)]
*  Over the weekend, [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3334.04s)]
*  North Korea detained three officials from the shipyard [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3336.04s)]
*  where this destroyer was built. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3338.04s)]
*  The chief engineer, the construction head, [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3340.04s)]
*  and an administrative manager. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3342.04s)]
*  Ben, can you imagine? [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3344.04s)]
*  They're trying to slide this giant brand new destroyer [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3346.04s)]
*  into the water. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3348.04s)]
*  There's a tower, kind of like a viewing area set up [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3350.04s)]
*  which presumably is Kim Jong Un [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3352.14s)]
*  and then like... [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3354.14s)]
*  He loves a good viewing ceremony. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3356.14s)]
*  Yeah, there's like 4,000 fucking generals [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3358.14s)]
*  whose job is to clap as loud as humanly possible [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3360.14s)]
*  and like show their love for him. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3362.14s)]
*  Imagine watching this thing tip over [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3364.14s)]
*  and just like collapse in sync [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3366.14s)]
*  and knowing like how fucked you are. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3368.14s)]
*  I feel genuinely bad for those guys. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3370.14s)]
*  I do too. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3372.14s)]
*  I will say the useful thing about it [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3374.14s)]
*  other than being good for content [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3376.14s)]
*  is sometimes [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3378.14s)]
*  and I fall into this trap too. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3380.24s)]
*  You make the mistake of [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3382.24s)]
*  building up some people. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3386.24s)]
*  Kim Jong Un looks like he's been on a bit of a roll. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3388.24s)]
*  He got all this aid from Russia. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3390.24s)]
*  His boys are getting some reps in Ukraine. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3392.24s)]
*  He's fine around looking at stuff. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3394.24s)]
*  He's advancing his nuclear program. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3396.24s)]
*  He's sitting on top of a completely absurd corrupt system [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3398.24s)]
*  in which shit like this happens. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3400.24s)]
*  The ships don't work. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3402.24s)]
*  So we do have to destroy the ships. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3404.24s)]
*  We have to destroy the ships. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3406.24s)]
*  The ships don't work. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3408.3399999999997s)]
*  We do have to remind ourselves [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3410.3399999999997s)]
*  the South Koreans look a little nutty right now [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3412.3399999999997s)]
*  but I'd much rather have their cards [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3414.3399999999997s)]
*  than the North Koreans. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3416.3399999999997s)]
*  This is not a system where this guy [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3418.3399999999997s)]
*  flies around and stands on platforms. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3420.3399999999997s)]
*  Wasn't there an account that was like [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3422.3399999999997s)]
*  Kim Jong Un looks at stuff? [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3424.3399999999997s)]
*  Well, some of the stuff he's looking at doesn't work. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3426.3399999999997s)]
*  It's interesting that Kim [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3428.3399999999997s)]
*  he's much more likely [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3430.3399999999997s)]
*  than his predecessors [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3432.3399999999997s)]
*  to talk publicly about these kinds of disasters [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3434.3399999999997s)]
*  which is interesting. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3436.44s)]
*  Maybe he just kind of understands the modern age [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3438.44s)]
*  He's a modern man. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3440.44s)]
*  He used everything to his advantage. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3442.44s)]
*  The journal reported the Trump administration [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3444.44s)]
*  is considering withdrawing about 4,500 US troops [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3446.44s)]
*  from South Korea and sending them to other places [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3448.44s)]
*  in the Indo-Pacific area. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3450.44s)]
*  That sounds like a very bad idea. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3452.44s)]
*  This is what I was worried about. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3454.44s)]
*  Because then you're green lighting Kim Jong Un [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3456.44s)]
*  to do some stupid shit in South Korea. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3458.44s)]
*  I assume we'd still have 21, 22,000 [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3460.44s)]
*  but it does sound like it could be the beginning [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3462.44s)]
*  Freak everybody out. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3464.54s)]
*  Freak everybody out, drive the South Koreans [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3466.54s)]
*  to the Chinese, [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3468.54s)]
*  freak out the Japanese. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3470.54s)]
*  If five years from now Japan and South Korea [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3472.54s)]
*  have nuclear weapons, this would be [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3474.54s)]
*  the beginning of that slide. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3476.54s)]
*  That's true, yeah. The beginning of the DVD. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3478.54s)]
*  Over in Japan there's a very different crisis. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3480.54s)]
*  They're calling it the rice crisis. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3482.54s)]
*  The price of rice has basically doubled this year in Japan. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3484.54s)]
*  They're even tapping into [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3486.54s)]
*  government resources and can't bring the price down. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3488.54s)]
*  I guess they have like [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3490.54s)]
*  the SPRO, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3492.64s)]
*  They have like a rice version which is pretty sweet. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3494.64s)]
*  Among the reasons cited for the shortage [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3496.64s)]
*  and the price increases are [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3498.64s)]
*  panic buying fueled by internet rumors [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3500.64s)]
*  of some kind of mega earthquake. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3502.64s)]
*  People globally substituting rice for wheat [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3504.64s)]
*  because of shortages resulting from [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3506.64s)]
*  the war in Ukraine. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3508.64s)]
*  And then a booming tourism sector [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3510.64s)]
*  and lots of I assume Americans coming over [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3512.64s)]
*  and wanting sushi and rice and everything else. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3514.64s)]
*  All of this is important though to explain [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3516.64s)]
*  how a joke about rice cost [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3518.64s)]
*  the Japanese farm minister his job. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3520.74s)]
*  So he was at a fundraiser with this farm minister [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3522.74s)]
*  Tako Ito. He joked that he [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3524.74s)]
*  never needed to buy rice because his supporters [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3526.74s)]
*  sent him plenty of it as a gift [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3528.74s)]
*  which prompted widespread outrage [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3530.74s)]
*  across the country. Opposition [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3532.74s)]
*  parties threatened a no confidence vote against him [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3534.74s)]
*  so he resigned. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3536.74s)]
*  Which maybe just think then how cool it [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3538.74s)]
*  must be to have a political system where leaders [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3540.74s)]
*  still felt like a sense of shame. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3542.74s)]
*  And that all worked. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3544.74s)]
*  There's possible [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3546.74s)]
*  the possibility of being shamed still exist [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3548.8399999999997s)]
*  in Japanese culture. I think it's [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3550.8399999999997s)]
*  particularly acute. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3552.8399999999997s)]
*  I will say [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3554.8399999999997s)]
*  a couple thoughts on this [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3556.8399999999997s)]
*  the first thing is [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3558.8399999999997s)]
*  Japan [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3560.8399999999997s)]
*  needs to give itself a little [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3562.8399999999997s)]
*  bit of a break here. There's some [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3564.8399999999997s)]
*  externalities here. You got tariffs [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3566.8399999999997s)]
*  all these factors. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3568.8399999999997s)]
*  Let's get to the rice crisis here. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3570.8399999999997s)]
*  We can do this together. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3572.8399999999997s)]
*  The other thing is like weirdly [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3574.8399999999997s)]
*  this made me think about [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3576.94s)]
*  and this is the benefit of doing this podcast [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3578.94s)]
*  for a few years. Because there will be stories like this [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3580.94s)]
*  and then they will kind of come and go [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3582.94s)]
*  do you remember [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3584.94s)]
*  to cite Japan's historic [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3586.94s)]
*  adversary when the Chinese [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3588.94s)]
*  farm minister just disappeared? [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3590.94s)]
*  And nobody, you can't [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3592.94s)]
*  figure out what happened to that guy. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3594.94s)]
*  When I saw this thing I was like he's [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3596.94s)]
*  just gone. Was that the one who was thought [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3598.94s)]
*  to have been having an affair with a reporter [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3600.94s)]
*  who had worked in America? Yes exactly. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3602.94s)]
*  I'm not sure he was impregnated or had an affair with [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3605.04s)]
*  a reporter in the US. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3607.04s)]
*  It was embarrassing and they just disappeared him. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3609.04s)]
*  Anyway, in the Japanese culture it's a little different [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3611.04s)]
*  here. Obviously this is a guy stepping down himself [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3613.04s)]
*  but it brought to mind [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3615.04s)]
*  it's tough [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3617.04s)]
*  sometimes to be a farm minister. Yeah it's a tough gig. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3619.04s)]
*  I do think they can solve this one. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3621.04s)]
*  I think they had a bad harvest because of hot weather. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3623.04s)]
*  There's obviously the rise in demand we talked about [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3625.04s)]
*  but also they have [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3627.04s)]
*  policies that they can just get rid of. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3629.04s)]
*  I think they paid farmers to reduce [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3631.04s)]
*  the price acreage to keep prices high and avoid [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3633.14s)]
*  overproduction. I think they probably have some [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3635.14s)]
*  restrictions on imports they could get rid of. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3637.14s)]
*  I actually have one substantive thing to say about this [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3639.14s)]
*  that is useful which is [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3641.14s)]
*  when I was in Singapore I was at this climate change [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3643.14s)]
*  kind of conference where they were giving [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3645.14s)]
*  awards to people. Pro or anti? Yeah. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3647.14s)]
*  They were against it. These were people [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3649.14s)]
*  that were coming up with new ways [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3651.14s)]
*  of dealing with climate change. One way [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3653.14s)]
*  is that they invented a new way to make rice. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3655.14s)]
*  How? Because [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3657.14s)]
*  rice creates a lot of methane. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3659.14s)]
*  Right? Because of the way [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3661.24s)]
*  you harvest it and all the water you use and stuff. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3663.24s)]
*  So these people basically [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3665.24s)]
*  developed a new way [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3667.24s)]
*  to make more rice with [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3669.24s)]
*  far less methane emission. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3671.24s)]
*  That's cool. Takes less land. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3673.24s)]
*  But the problem is, like [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3675.24s)]
*  rice farmers, like everybody else who've done [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3677.24s)]
*  things a certain way their whole lives, they don't want to change. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3679.24s)]
*  So I'm not [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3681.24s)]
*  saying I know the intricacies [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3683.24s)]
*  of the Japanese rice market but part of this is [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3685.24s)]
*  as there's more demand [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3687.24s)]
*  and you just need to produce more rice. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3689.3399999999997s)]
*  I mean, like shit, people weren't eating sushi [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3691.3399999999997s)]
*  in this country that much when I was a kid. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3693.3399999999997s)]
*  No. I can't imagine. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3695.3399999999997s)]
*  When did people think, like the 80s? [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3697.3399999999997s)]
*  It started to be, but now it's just normalized. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3699.3399999999997s)]
*  It's everywhere. Think how much rice that is. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3701.3399999999997s)]
*  They've got to probably come up with some new ways [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3703.3399999999997s)]
*  to produce the rice. Yeah. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3705.3399999999997s)]
*  There's probably a lot of pelted demand [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3707.3399999999997s)]
*  just from the US. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3709.3399999999997s)]
*  So sushi began to achieve widespread popularity [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3711.3399999999997s)]
*  in the US in the mid-1960s. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3713.3399999999997s)]
*  Mainstream breakthrough came in the [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3715.3399999999997s)]
*  70s and 80s. Yeah, yeah. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3717.44s)]
*  I can see that. Now we all just love it. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3719.44s)]
*  I get these Japanese rice. I get this fancy [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3721.44s)]
*  these big bags, but they're expensive. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3723.44s)]
*  Are they? Do you notice the difference? [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3725.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's better rice. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3727.44s)]
*  Do you have a rice cooker? No, but I do the thing [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3729.44s)]
*  and now I wash the rice [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3731.44s)]
*  like I wash the starch off [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3733.44s)]
*  and I'm pretty like [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3735.44s)]
*  I've had some people be like, I can't believe you don't [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3737.44s)]
*  wash your rice and all this stuff. So now I like wash it multiple times. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3739.44s)]
*  Not me, man. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3741.44s)]
*  I'm a keen wagai living in a rice world. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3743.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3745.54s)]
*  Final story, Ben. Uncle Ben's. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3747.54s)]
*  Honestly, we have like frozen [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3749.54s)]
*  stuff in the freezer that you can just nuke [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3751.54s)]
*  in two and a half minutes and then your kids are full. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3753.54s)]
*  Final story [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3755.54s)]
*  is a fun one from our buddies in New Zealand [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3757.54s)]
*  where apparently a humble [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3759.54s)]
*  cookie tin plays an instrumental role [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3761.54s)]
*  in keeping their democracy going. So this is called [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3763.54s)]
*  the biscuit tin as it's known [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3765.54s)]
*  there. It is used to determine what bills are taken up [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3767.54s)]
*  by New Zealand's parliament. Basically, [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3769.54s)]
*  they tally a list of proposals, one through [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3771.54s)]
*  90, then place bingo tokens labeled [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3773.64s)]
*  with those numbers in the tin, shake it up. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3775.64s)]
*  Whatever's picked gets added [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3777.64s)]
*  to the parliamentary agenda. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3779.64s)]
*  The tin has a faded label that reads [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3781.64s)]
*  members bills. It was apparently bought by a [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3783.64s)]
*  staffer at a Wellington supermarket [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3785.64s)]
*  in the early 90s. Most bills [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3787.64s)]
*  never enter the tin. They [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3789.64s)]
*  go through like the ruling parties, [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3791.64s)]
*  legislators, but every two weeks [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3793.64s)]
*  they set aside time for the biscuit [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3795.64s)]
*  tin, which, I don't know, man, [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3797.64s)]
*  I genuinely read about this and was like [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3799.64s)]
*  that's a pretty cool idea. I imagine [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3801.74s)]
*  the US version, you know, [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3803.74s)]
*  50% of the time you [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3805.74s)]
*  will have the most hateful shit [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3807.74s)]
*  imaginable by some awful [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3809.74s)]
*  Republican, but imagine if Congress [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3811.74s)]
*  every couple weeks had to vote on [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3813.74s)]
*  a minimum wage increase or [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3815.74s)]
*  committing to not cut Medicare. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3817.74s)]
*  I feel like that would be better [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3819.74s)]
*  than whatever we're doing now. It's a lot better than having [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3821.74s)]
*  like Mike Johnson in a rules committee [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3823.74s)]
*  you know, drafting a big [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3825.74s)]
*  beautiful bill. Yeah, 4am behind closed [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3827.74s)]
*  doors. Yeah, I like this approach, [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3829.8399999999997s)]
*  biscuit tin. I mean, I sent [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3831.8399999999997s)]
*  you, I mean, not to, [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3833.8399999999997s)]
*  because I love New Zealand, I love people from New Zealand, [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3835.8399999999997s)]
*  but [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3837.8399999999997s)]
*  the other parliamentary tradition that I flag [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3839.8399999999997s)]
*  for your attention was this idea of drinking [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3841.8399999999997s)]
*  out of a boot in the Australian Parliament. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3843.8399999999997s)]
*  I forgot you said that. We could do both, [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3845.8399999999997s)]
*  right? We could take this from New [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3847.8399999999997s)]
*  Zealand and the drinking out of a boot from [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3849.8399999999997s)]
*  Australia. I would like to say [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3851.8399999999997s)]
*  to the members and the constituents [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3853.8399999999997s)]
*  across WA, thank you [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3855.8399999999997s)]
*  for two fantastic [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3857.94s)]
*  terms. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3859.94s)]
*  Cheers. Order [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3861.94s)]
*  members. Order. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3863.94s)]
*  The Honorable [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3865.94s)]
*  Kyle McGinn will take his seats. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3867.94s)]
*  There's a dude that literally just drinks like a [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3869.94s)]
*  beer out of a boot to finish his [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3871.94s)]
*  term in Congress. It was like [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3873.94s)]
*  the end of his second term and [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3875.94s)]
*  all of a sudden he just [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3877.94s)]
*  dumps a beer in through and does a [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3879.94s)]
*  shoey in front of everyone. I love [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3881.94s)]
*  New Zealand and Australia. And I love, I [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3883.94s)]
*  don't even understand the internal rivalry, which I'm sure [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3886.04s)]
*  is like really fucking intense. So I [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3888.04s)]
*  want to know more about that, like the New [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3890.04s)]
*  Zealand versus Australia rivalry. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3892.04s)]
*  Kyle McGinn, an outgoing state [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3894.04s)]
*  MP from Western Australia, you performed a shoey, [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3896.04s)]
*  a celebratory ritual [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3898.04s)]
*  at the end of his farewell speech in [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3900.04s)]
*  the Western Australian Parliament. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3902.04s)]
*  Western Australian Parliament. So maybe we should be looking [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3904.04s)]
*  to the Western Australian Parliament. Yeah, these are my people. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3906.04s)]
*  I've never done a shoey [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3908.04s)]
*  myself that I recall. I think [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3910.04s)]
*  I did a shoey in college, but I mean [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3912.04s)]
*  I'm not sure I remember. I think I was [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3914.14s)]
*  in the middle of a hazy. Hannah's friends, [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3916.14s)]
*  she's from kind of rural Maryland, and they [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3918.14s)]
*  would chug out of a duck. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3920.14s)]
*  It was like a duck decoy. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3922.14s)]
*  He'd just kind of carve a hole in it, fill it up with beers [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3924.14s)]
*  and just hammer it down. That's kind of fun. Yeah, it was a good time. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3926.14s)]
*  Okay. Jim Hines. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3928.14s)]
*  With that, we're going to take a quick break. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3930.14s)]
*  When we come back you'll hear my interview with Congressman [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=3932.14s)]

*  by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4082.74s)]
*  may have been based on an illegal [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4084.74s)]
*  NSA wiretap that was [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4086.74s)]
*  conducted without a wiretap, without a warrant, [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4088.74s)]
*  I should say. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4090.74s)]
*  Hegseth is using the existence [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4092.74s)]
*  of this investigation [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4094.74s)]
*  to fire several of his top aides. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4096.74s)]
*  Do you know anything about these reports? [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4098.74s)]
*  And if true, can you help us understand [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4100.74s)]
*  the implications for the intelligence [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4102.74s)]
*  community and for civil liberties generally? [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4104.74s)]
*  Yeah, sure, sure. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4106.74s)]
*  So, you know, [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4108.74s)]
*  and I'm reading the same Guardian article [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4110.84s)]
*  you are, but as somebody who's been sort of [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4112.84s)]
*  kicking around the intelligence community in an [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4114.84s)]
*  oversight role for more than a decade, [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4116.84s)]
*  I can tell you that there's almost certainly [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4118.84s)]
*  nothing to that. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4120.84s)]
*  The NSA is not allowed [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4122.84s)]
*  to surveil people inside [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4124.84s)]
*  the United States full stop. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4126.84s)]
*  And I mean, from the chief of the NSA [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4128.84s)]
*  right on down to the person who started yesterday, [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4130.84s)]
*  they know what a [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4132.84s)]
*  very, very serious legal issue [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4134.84s)]
*  it would be if that were to change. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4136.84s)]
*  And then, of course, you've got an additional [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4138.9400000000005s)]
*  layer, you know, it would be bad enough [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4140.9400000000005s)]
*  obviously if the NSA turned its surveillance capabilities [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4142.9400000000005s)]
*  on U.S. persons [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4144.9400000000005s)]
*  inside the United States, but then to do it around [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4146.9400000000005s)]
*  public officials. So, anyway, [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4148.9400000000005s)]
*  the NSA, I know, would [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4150.9400000000005s)]
*  never do that. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4152.9400000000005s)]
*  I think the people that would be involved in the [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4154.9400000000005s)]
*  technical aspect of that right up into [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4156.9400000000005s)]
*  whoever ordered it would have understood that they [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4158.9400000000005s)]
*  would be looking at jail time if anything was [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4160.9400000000005s)]
*  even remotely like what we're hearing about [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4162.9400000000005s)]
*  in the Guardian. Look, I think my analysis [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4164.9400000000005s)]
*  is, you know, first of all, it's [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4167.04s)]
*  interesting, right, that these firings at the top [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4169.04s)]
*  of the Pentagon required some [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4171.04s)]
*  sort of explanation because to get [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4173.04s)]
*  back to the NSA, [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4175.04s)]
*  when they fired General Tim Hawk, [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4177.04s)]
*  a widely respected director [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4179.04s)]
*  of the NSA, there was no explanation [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4181.04s)]
*  given. And [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4183.04s)]
*  you know, that was a serious blow to the NSA. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4185.04s)]
*  And now they sort of feel obligated to say, [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4187.04s)]
*  oh, well, it might have involved leaks and making up this [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4189.04s)]
*  wild stuff about the NSA. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4191.04s)]
*  I think that story here [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4193.04s)]
*  is just what a snake pit [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4195.14s)]
*  it is inside the [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4197.14s)]
*  Secretary of Defense's office at the [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4199.14s)]
*  top of the Pentagon. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4201.14s)]
*  So we don't think they're planning illegal NSA wiretaps on [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4203.14s)]
*  signal somewhere where you feel like that's not likely? [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4205.14s)]
*  I think it's almost [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4207.14s)]
*  certainly not true. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4209.14s)]

*  His words. Because [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4516.04s)]
*  he was bowing to the pressure from the White House [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4518.04s)]
*  and as a result we have 4,400 [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4520.04s)]
*  dead American [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4522.04s)]
*  troops for a war that was fought on [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4524.04s)]
*  false pretenses. So this stuff matters. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4526.04s)]
*  And again, you know, Joe [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4528.04s)]
*  Kink can say all that he wants to say about how much [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4530.04s)]
*  he hates Democrats and stuff. But the [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4532.04s)]
*  phrase that this not be used [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4534.04s)]

*  president shows that he is [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4538.04s)]
*  beyond disqualified from a senior [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4540.04s)]
*  role in the intelligence community. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4542.04s)]
*  Yeah. And by the way, I believe he's been nominated [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4544.04s)]
*  to run the National Counterterrorism [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4546.04s)]
*  Center. So not only is [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4548.04s)]
*  he politicizing intelligence, but he's [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4550.04s)]
*  also stupid enough to put that sentence in [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4552.04s)]
*  EMA, which in my book is Two Strikes. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4554.04s)]
*  But I mean, look, I'm not a big Tulsi Gabbard [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4556.04s)]
*  fan. But if you take her at her word, [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4558.04s)]
*  her kind of political origin story [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4560.04s)]
*  is someone who served in the military, [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4562.04s)]
*  saw the war in Iraq, felt like it was a [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4564.04s)]
*  disaster, saw all the politicization [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4566.04s)]
*  of intelligence that you just referenced, [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4568.04s)]
*  and wanted to change [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4570.04s)]
*  course and not get into regime change wars [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4572.04s)]
*  and not ever let that happen again. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4574.04s)]
*  And for her to [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4576.04s)]
*  preside over, [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4578.04s)]
*  look, the Iraq War was [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4580.04s)]
*  obviously a greater disaster in terms of the [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4582.04s)]
*  outcome. But in terms of just blatantly politicizing [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4584.04s)]
*  intelligence and [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4586.04s)]
*  dictating the product [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4588.04s)]
*  for solely political reasons, [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4590.04s)]
*  what Kent is doing in this email [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4592.04s)]
*  I think almost seems worse to me. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4594.04s)]
*  And it was just shocking given [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4596.04s)]
*  what her professed motivations are. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4598.04s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And you know, I served [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4600.04s)]
*  with Tulsi Gabbard, didn't know her terribly well. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4602.04s)]
*  But let me say this, and I'll say this about [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4604.04s)]
*  President Trump as well. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4606.04s)]
*  It's hard to look back on the last generation [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4608.04s)]
*  looking at the Iraq War, [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4610.04s)]
*  looking at the Afghanistan War, [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4612.04s)]
*  the failed nation building that we tried for [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4614.04s)]
*  more than a decade there, going back to Vietnam. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4616.04s)]
*  The mistakes, the strategic [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4618.04s)]
*  mistakes America makes [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4620.04s)]
*  are mistakes of over engagement [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4622.04s)]
*  militarily. We thought we could turn Vietnam [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4624.04s)]
*  into a democracy. We thought we would [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4626.04s)]
*  turn Iraq into a democracy [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4628.04s)]
*  at the point of a gun. We thought that Afghanistan, [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4630.04s)]
*  we could grow this medieval society [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4632.04s)]
*  into a New England. You know, [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4634.04s)]
*  we make that mistake over and over again. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4636.04s)]
*  And Tulsi Gabbard, I know this from when she was in [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4638.04s)]
*  a political role, sort of disagrees [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4640.04s)]
*  with that. That's what led her to go see [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4642.04s)]
*  that terrible dictator of [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4644.04s)]
*  Syria, Bashar al-Assad. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4646.04s)]
*  You know, I don't think that was done out [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4648.04s)]
*  of any [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4650.04s)]
*  malign motive. I think she genuinely [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4652.04s)]
*  wanted to, in whatever weird [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4654.04s)]
*  way she thought she could accomplish it, [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4656.04s)]
*  avoid another Middle Eastern war. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4658.04s)]
*  So that instinct is not a bad [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4660.04s)]
*  instinct. But here's the point. Here's the [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4662.04s)]
*  point. When you take a job as Director [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4664.04s)]
*  of CIA or Director of National Intelligence, [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4666.04s)]
*  you set aside your policy [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4668.04s)]
*  beliefs, you put those things in a freezer, and [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4670.04s)]
*  you put that freezer in the basement, and you lock [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4672.04s)]
*  that thing up, because the intelligence community [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4674.04s)]
*  is not about policy. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4676.04s)]
*  It is about providing, [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4678.04s)]
*  you know, using the 90 billion dollars [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4680.04s)]
*  ish of resources that we provide [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4682.04s)]
*  to the intelligence community, the [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4684.04s)]
*  president and other policy makers, with [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4686.04s)]
*  the very best information [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4688.04s)]
*  that we can get so that they make [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4690.04s)]
*  good decisions. So there [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4692.04s)]
*  is no room for [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4694.04s)]
*  policy making [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4696.04s)]
*  in the intelligence apparatus, for [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4698.04s)]
*  obvious reasons, right? And so [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4700.04s)]
*  that's bad enough, and I, you know, [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4702.04s)]
*  I hope that Tulsi [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4704.04s)]
*  understands that. But then to [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4706.04s)]
*  use your office, and remember [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4708.04s)]
*  he's Chief of Staff to Tulsi Gabbard, [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4710.04s)]
*  for political protection, [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4712.04s)]
*  for political figures, [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4714.04s)]
*  again, that, you know, who [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4716.04s)]
*  knows what the United States Senate will do. Every [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4718.04s)]
*  once in a while, a few Republican senators, you [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4720.04s)]
*  know, search around for a few hours [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4722.04s)]
*  and find their backbones. But, I mean, [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4724.04s)]
*  if they can look at those emails [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4726.04s)]
*  that Joe can send, and by the way, it's more than just [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4728.04s)]
*  the phrase that you outlined. It's a constant [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4730.04s)]
*  and repeated attempt to bring up [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4732.04s)]
*  the failures of Joe Biden, to put this in the context [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4734.04s)]
*  of an open southern border. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4736.04s)]
*  It is blatant politicization of [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4738.04s)]
*  intelligence. So, I mean, if a few [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4740.04s)]
*  Republican senators can, you know, [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4742.04s)]
*  do the profoundly unnatural act of finding [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4744.04s)]
*  their backbone, this guy [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4746.04s)]
*  will not be confirmed in the role [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4748.04s)]
*  that he's been nominated for as Chief of the National [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4750.04s)]
*  Counterterrorism Center. Yeah, I hope they will [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4752.04s)]
*  dig deep into whatever information [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4754.04s)]
*  they can find about this whole affair. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4756.04s)]
*  I do want to turn to the war in Gaza. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4758.04s)]
*  So, in July of 2024, [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4760.04s)]
*  Brett Holmgren, who was then a top [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4762.04s)]
*  intelligence official at the State Department, said about [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4764.04s)]
*  October 7th, quote, [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4766.04s)]
*  It was and is and will be a generational [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4768.04s)]
*  event that terrorist organizations in the Middle East [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4770.04s)]
*  and around the world use as a [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4772.04s)]
*  recruiting opportunity. In March [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4774.04s)]
*  of 2024, Avriel Haynes, [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4776.04s)]
*  who was then Biden's Director of National Intelligence, [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4778.04s)]
*  said, quote, It is likely that the [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4780.04s)]
*  Gaza conflict will have a generational impact on [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4782.04s)]
*  terrorism, end quote. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4784.04s)]
*  If you fast forward to today, [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4786.04s)]
*  things are worse for civilians in Gaza. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4788.04s)]
*  They are still being slaughtered every [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4790.04s)]
*  single day by airstrikes. People are starving [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4792.04s)]
*  to death because Israel is blockading [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4794.04s)]
*  humanitarian aid. And then on the [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4796.04s)]
*  political track, not only is there no [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4798.04s)]
*  hope of a two-state solution, there is now [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4800.04s)]
*  a plan backed by the United States [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4802.04s)]
*  to ethnically cleanse the Gaza [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4804.04s)]
*  strip and displace everyone there [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4806.04s)]
*  to Libya. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4808.04s)]
*  What are you seeing in terms of the [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4810.04s)]
*  impact when it comes to terrorist [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4812.04s)]
*  recruiting? And how much are [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4814.04s)]
*  these threats being directed against the United [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4816.04s)]
*  States, given that we are fully [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4818.04s)]
*  backing the Israelis in this war? [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4820.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. So let's [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4822.04s)]
*  take up both those questions. First, the [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4824.04s)]
*  terrorism question. Look, the [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4826.04s)]
*  numbers speak for themselves. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4828.04s)]
*  You know, Hamas has [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4830.04s)]
*  been able to, not entirely, [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4832.04s)]
*  but has been able to largely [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4834.04s)]
*  reconstitute the [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4836.04s)]
*  personnel that it has lost in this [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4838.04s)]
*  war. Not entirely. Let's just throw a [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4840.04s)]
*  number out there and say two-thirds to three-quarters [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4842.04s)]
*  of the manpower that [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4844.04s)]
*  they have lost to Israeli military activity [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4846.04s)]
*  has been reconstituted. Why? [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4848.04s)]
*  Because there's an awful lot of young men [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4850.04s)]
*  in Gaza who see [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4852.04s)]
*  the devastation that has been visited [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4854.04s)]
*  on their communities. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4856.04s)]
*  Yes, by Hamas, and let's start [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4858.04s)]
*  with that, but then [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4860.04s)]
*  subsequently by the Israelis. And this is [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4862.04s)]
*  a story as old as time, right? You know, [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4864.04s)]
*  there were probably as many terrorists or more [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4866.04s)]
*  terrorists in Afghanistan after we left [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4868.04s)]
*  than there were before we left, because when you [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4870.04s)]
*  blow up a village, which inevitably you do [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4872.04s)]
*  when you're taking, you know, substantial [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4874.04s)]
*  military activity, there are brothers, [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4876.04s)]
*  there are nephews, there are people who [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4878.04s)]
*  will then take up arms. So [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4880.04s)]
*  yes, this [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4882.04s)]
*  righteous [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4884.04s)]
*  action, and I [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4886.04s)]
*  think it has ceased to be righteous, [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4888.04s)]
*  that the Israelis took in response to [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4890.04s)]
*  October 7th, has turned [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4892.04s)]
*  into, at least inside Gaza, [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4894.04s)]
*  a recruiting tool. Now, [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4896.04s)]
*  there's a larger strategic [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4898.04s)]
*  question here, which is if you're the leadership [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4900.04s)]
*  of Hezbollah and Hamas, [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4902.04s)]
*  most of whom are dead now, but [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4904.04s)]
*  the replacements, and you say to yourself, gosh, [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4906.04s)]
*  if we could go back and do October 7th [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4908.04s)]
*  again, would we do it? [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4910.04s)]
*  I suspect there would be [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4912.04s)]
*  a great deal of disagreement on that question, [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4914.04s)]
*  right? Because Hezbollah and its leadership [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4916.04s)]
*  has been decimated, same is [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4918.04s)]
*  true of Hamas. And so I think the strategic [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4920.04s)]
*  question is different. But, [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4922.04s)]
*  you know, look, terrorism requires one angry [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4924.04s)]
*  person to do a terrible thing, [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4926.04s)]
*  as we saw [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4928.04s)]
*  in Washington, D.C., where one [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4930.04s)]
*  radicalized, you know, [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4932.04s)]
*  horrible person [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4934.04s)]
*  murdered two innocent [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4936.04s)]
*  employees of the Israeli [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4938.04s)]
*  embassy. Whether you want to call [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4940.04s)]
*  that a terrorist act or not, [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4942.04s)]
*  terrorism at that level is not hard to do. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4944.04s)]
*  So let me come back [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4946.04s)]
*  to the larger strategic focus. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4948.04s)]
*  I don't think anybody [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4950.04s)]
*  on October 8th [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4952.04s)]
*  believed that the Israelis should [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4954.04s)]
*  do anything other than to visit retribution [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4956.04s)]
*  on Hamas for [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4958.04s)]
*  the appalling attack of October 7th. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4960.04s)]
*  But as you pointed out, [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4962.04s)]
*  we have now gotten to a place, and, [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4964.04s)]
*  you know, I was in Israel two months ago, [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4966.04s)]
*  three months ago, with the prime minister, [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4968.04s)]
*  where the prime [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4970.04s)]
*  minister, I [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4972.04s)]
*  think, sees his role now [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4974.04s)]
*  as the obliteration of [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4976.04s)]
*  all of Israel's enemy. I think it's sort of a cathartic [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4978.04s)]
*  thing that he will do to make up [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4980.04s)]
*  for the attack that happened on his watch. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4982.04s)]
*  And you're exactly right. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4984.04s)]
*  The plan to level [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4986.04s)]
*  Gaza with the idea of [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4988.04s)]
*  either voluntarily or involuntarily [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4990.04s)]
*  moving those, I mean, [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4992.04s)]
*  let's just call that what it is. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4994.04s)]
*  That would be a war crime. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4996.04s)]
*  It would be a crime [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=4998.04s)]
*  against humanity to displace. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5000.04s)]
*  It is the definition of ethnic [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5002.04s)]
*  cleansing. Now, you know, I [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5004.04s)]
*  trust the Israeli people and [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5006.04s)]
*  Israel to not go that [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5008.04s)]
*  far, even though the prime minister may want [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5010.04s)]
*  to. But even today, where [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5012.04s)]
*  we have wildly inadequate [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5014.04s)]
*  humanitarian aid moving into Gaza, [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5016.04s)]
*  that too is a violation of the [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5018.04s)]
*  Fourth Geneva Convention. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5020.04s)]
*  And it needs to stop. It needs to stop [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5022.04s)]
*  both for the way you [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5024.04s)]
*  frame this question, the [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5026.04s)]
*  anger and the rage and the terrorism [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5028.04s)]
*  that it will generate, but it needs to stop for [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5030.04s)]
*  moral reasons as well, which is, [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5032.04s)]
*  you know, it is time for the civilian population [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5034.04s)]
*  of Gaza to stop paying the [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5036.04s)]
*  cost for the hideous acts [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5038.04s)]
*  of Hamas. It is time for the prime minister [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5040.04s)]
*  to say, now we [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5042.04s)]
*  think about how we rebuild [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5044.04s)]
*  this society on a trajectory [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5046.04s)]
*  to [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5048.04s)]
*  someday live at peace [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5050.04s)]
*  with the state of Israel. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5052.04s)]
*  I mean, so American law [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5054.04s)]
*  prohibits arms sales to countries [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5056.04s)]
*  that restrict humanitarian aid. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5058.04s)]
*  U.S. laws restrict [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5060.04s)]
*  U.S. weapons sales to countries [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5062.04s)]
*  that are committing war crimes [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5064.04s)]
*  or weapons sales [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5066.04s)]
*  to foreign military units credibly [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5068.04s)]
*  implicated in gross human rights violations. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5070.04s)]
*  I don't see anything classified, [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5072.04s)]
*  but I see [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5074.04s)]
*  lots and lots of horrific images [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5076.04s)]
*  and videos and news reports on [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5078.04s)]
*  social media that suggest [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5080.04s)]
*  to me that Israel is [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5082.04s)]
*  committing war crimes [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5084.04s)]
*  constantly, that clearly they're [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5086.04s)]
*  restricting humanitarian aid and doing a number of [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5088.04s)]
*  things in contravention of U.S. law. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5090.04s)]
*  But the Biden State Department [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5092.04s)]
*  told us over and over [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5094.04s)]
*  and again that that was not happening. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5096.04s)]
*  And the Trump [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5098.04s)]
*  administration is continuing the Biden policy [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5100.04s)]
*  of just full-throated support [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5102.04s)]
*  for the Israeli government in this war. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5104.04s)]
*  Were those assertions [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5106.04s)]
*  that Israel was not committing war crimes? [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5108.04s)]
*  Were those accurate [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5110.04s)]
*  in your view compared to what you've seen [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5112.04s)]
*  both in intelligence and in public reporting? [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5114.04s)]
*  You know, with hindsight, [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5116.04s)]
*  you know, we all saw the video [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5118.04s)]
*  of what looked like, [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5120.04s)]
*  and I'm going to say what looked like, [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5122.04s)]
*  the murder of [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5124.04s)]
*  the Red Crescent workers, [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5126.04s)]
*  you know, and [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5128.04s)]
*  then the cover-up where we never [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5130.04s)]
*  would have known about that murder had a phone [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5132.04s)]
*  not been found on a dead body. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5134.04s)]
*  The killing of journalists, which [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5136.04s)]
*  again, I'll be careful [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5138.04s)]
*  here because [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5140.04s)]
*  I don't like [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5142.04s)]
*  forming conclusions without good [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5144.04s)]
*  facts. Because there's a long history [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5146.04s)]
*  of the IDF acting [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5148.04s)]
*  carefully and legally. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5150.04s)]
*  I think that [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5152.04s)]
*  the Biden administration was stuck [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5154.04s)]
*  in a paradigm [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5156.04s)]
*  that Prime Minister Netanyahu [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5158.04s)]
*  has now sacrificed. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5160.04s)]
*  Because there have been enough incidents, starting [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5162.04s)]
*  with the horrors visited upon [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5164.04s)]
*  the civilian population to the killing [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5166.04s)]
*  of the world food [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5168.04s)]
*  José Andrés people [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5170.04s)]
*  to, and the list goes on and on [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5172.04s)]
*  and on, where sadly [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5174.04s)]
*  and this comes from somebody who has traditionally [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5176.04s)]
*  been a very strong supporter of the state of Israel [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5178.04s)]
*  where we can no longer take it for granted [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5180.04s)]
*  that the IDF is acting first [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5182.04s)]
*  and foremost in a humanitarian way [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5184.04s)]
*  with a constant reference [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5186.04s)]
*  to the laws of armed conflict. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5188.04s)]
*  And so that's a long-winded [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5190.04s)]
*  way of saying Joe Biden [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5192.04s)]
*  did not use the leverage that he had [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5194.04s)]
*  to force a change [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5196.04s)]
*  in Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5198.04s)]
*  Now I'm not sure that he could have succeeded. Netanyahu [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5200.04s)]
*  is on, very literally [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5202.04s)]
*  what I think as he or his people [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5204.04s)]
*  regard as a mission from God here. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5206.04s)]
*  It's a mission of [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5208.04s)]
*  as I said [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5210.04s)]
*  maybe reparation for what happened [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5212.04s)]
*  on October 7th on his watch. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5214.04s)]
*  But I do think in retrospect it's fair [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5216.04s)]
*  to say that the Biden administration did not use [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5218.04s)]
*  the full leverage that it has. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5220.04s)]
*  And I say that sadly [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5222.04s)]
*  because [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5224.04s)]
*  while I do think that the current [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5226.04s)]
*  president will [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5228.04s)]
*  do what he can to [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5230.04s)]
*  stop another [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5232.04s)]
*  war in the Middle East, and now I'm referring [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5234.04s)]
*  to the possibility of an Israeli attack [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5236.04s)]
*  on Iran, he [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5238.04s)]
*  will continue to not use leverage [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5240.04s)]
*  to try to get the prime minister. He will [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5242.04s)]
*  continue to give the prime minister [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5244.04s)]
*  anything that the prime minister wants, even as [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5246.04s)]
*  it becomes increasingly clear that the prime minister [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5248.04s)]
*  has a very dark [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5250.04s)]
*  vision for Gaza that is [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5252.04s)]
*  not consistent with the laws of armed conflict or [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5254.04s)]
*  humanitarian law. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5256.04s)]
*  You mentioned a possible conflict with Iran. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5258.04s)]
*  I think to their credit, the Trump [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5260.04s)]
*  administration has now engaged in [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5262.04s)]
*  several rounds of talks with [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5264.04s)]
*  Iran in hopes of securing some sort of deal [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5266.04s)]
*  to prevent a conflict and also prevent [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5268.04s)]
*  Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. It does [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5270.04s)]
*  though seem like there is an internal [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5272.04s)]
*  fight within Trump's team [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5274.04s)]
*  about whether they would be okay with [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5276.04s)]
*  a deal that allows Iran [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5278.04s)]
*  to have some very limited amount [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5280.04s)]
*  of uranium enrichment [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5282.04s)]
*  for civilian use to generate nuclear [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5284.04s)]
*  power essentially. Or [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5286.04s)]
*  whether they've fully drawn a red line [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5288.04s)]
*  that will demand that Iran [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5290.04s)]
*  have no enrichment program [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5292.04s)]
*  whatsoever. Do you have a sense [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5294.04s)]
*  of what the accurate position [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5296.04s)]
*  is given the competing news reports? [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5298.04s)]
*  And what do you think is the right answer here [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5300.04s)]
*  policy wise, just in terms of [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5302.04s)]
*  efficacy? [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5304.04s)]
*  This is very technical stuff. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5306.04s)]
*  But if you are acting in good [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5310.04s)]
*  faith, as I think the Obama [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5312.04s)]
*  administration was, you can put [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5314.04s)]
*  in place the safeguards to make sure [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5316.04s)]
*  that Iran is six months [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5318.04s)]
*  to a year away from having the capability [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5320.04s)]
*  to put together or use [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5322.04s)]
*  a nuclear weapon. That is technologically [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5324.04s)]
*  feasible. And in fact, that's where we were [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5326.04s)]
*  once the JCPOA was signed. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5328.04s)]
*  Now, you know, the American right and certainly [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5330.04s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu didn't [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5332.04s)]
*  agree with that. But [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5334.04s)]
*  as a technical matter, it was true. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5336.04s)]
*  So, you know, can you [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5338.04s)]
*  and I understand that it's [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5340.04s)]
*  the position of the Prime Minister that [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5342.04s)]
*  Iran can have no [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5344.04s)]
*  enrichment capacity, but [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5346.04s)]
*  technically speaking, it is possible to make [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5348.04s)]
*  sure that enrichment that is done is done to a [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5350.04s)]
*  level and in a quantity that [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5352.04s)]
*  cannot be used for a nuclear [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5354.04s)]
*  weapon. And so long as the [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5356.04s)]
*  ability of inspectors [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5358.04s)]
*  to go in and confirm that stuff is [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5360.04s)]
*  that is a technically feasible [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5362.04s)]
*  thing. Now, we're not in a world, I think, today [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5364.04s)]
*  where technically feasible is what matters. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5366.04s)]
*  Based on my contact with the Israeli [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5368.04s)]
*  Prime Minister, I have very little [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5370.04s)]
*  doubt that he is hell bent on going to war [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5372.04s)]
*  with Iran. Again, I [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5374.04s)]
*  think this is as much cathartic for October [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5376.04s)]
*  7th as it is anything else, because [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5378.04s)]
*  you know, an attack on Iran's nuclear [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5380.04s)]
*  sites will set them back. No question [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5382.04s)]
*  about it. You can destroy enough stuff [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5384.04s)]
*  so that Iran is now a year, [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5386.04s)]
*  18 months, two years away from being [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5388.04s)]
*  where they are today, which is pretty close [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5390.04s)]
*  to the capability of having a nuclear weapon. But it [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5392.04s)]
*  doesn't end it. And what have you done in the meantime? [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5394.04s)]
*  You have united a fractious [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5396.04s)]
*  Iranian population behind a profoundly [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5398.04s)]
*  unpopular regime, because you've attacked their country. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5400.04s)]
*  You have probably [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5402.04s)]
*  unleashed a staggering [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5404.04s)]
*  amount of volatility [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5406.04s)]
*  into the oil market, which translates [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5408.04s)]
*  into pain at the pump [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5410.04s)]
*  for an awful lot of Americans. And you've probably [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5412.04s)]
*  unleashed the Iranians' desire to conduct [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5414.04s)]
*  terrorist attacks around the world. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5416.04s)]
*  So, you know, I think that's [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5418.04s)]
*  where the Prime Minister is right now. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5420.04s)]
*  And I think he's probably paying a very dangerous [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5422.04s)]
*  poker game with Donald Trump. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5424.04s)]
*  Because again, I'm going to credit Donald Trump here. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5426.04s)]
*  I think Donald Trump is allergic [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5428.04s)]
*  to kinetic conflict, particularly [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5430.04s)]
*  in the Middle East. But what's going to [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5432.04s)]
*  happen is Israel is going to tell a story, [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5434.04s)]
*  or I should say the Prime Minister is going to [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5436.04s)]
*  tell a story about how any enrichment [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5438.04s)]
*  capability at all means that [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5440.04s)]
*  there's a bomb in the future, means [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5442.04s)]
*  that Tel Aviv is under a mushroom cloud, and by [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5444.04s)]
*  the way, so is New York City, Boston, and Los Angeles. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5446.04s)]
*  We saw this in the run-up to the Iraq [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5448.04s)]
*  War, right? We saw [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5450.04s)]
*  the then Bill [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5452.04s)]
*  Crystal and the Neocons [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5454.04s)]
*  tell a terrifying story to the American [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5456.04s)]
*  people. I think this is what [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5458.04s)]
*  we're going to start to see pretty soon, [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5460.04s)]
*  driven by the Prime Minister's desire [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5462.04s)]
*  ultimately to at least get a green [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5464.04s)]
*  light from the United States to attack Iran. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5466.04s)]
*  Anyone who [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5468.04s)]
*  wants more information about Netanyahu's [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5470.04s)]
*  credibility on this subject should look at his [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5472.04s)]
*  testimony before Congress, I believe, [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5474.04s)]
*  about the Iraq War and just how wrong he was [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5476.04s)]
*  then, and then maybe [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5478.04s)]
*  compare that to what he's [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5480.04s)]
*  saying now about Iran. Thank you for letting [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5482.04s)]
*  me skip around a little bit. I know we're just getting short on time. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5484.04s)]
*  Just the last couple of questions. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5486.04s)]
*  So the Trump administration, their [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5488.04s)]
*  Ukraine policy is incoherent [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5490.04s)]
*  at best, right? I mean, Trump has been hammering [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5492.04s)]
*  Zelensky over the weekend. He decided [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5494.04s)]
*  to yell at Putin on truth [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5496.04s)]
*  social again. In your [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5498.04s)]
*  estimation, what happens [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5500.04s)]
*  to the Ukrainian side if [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5502.04s)]
*  things just kind of continue [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5504.04s)]
*  steady state as they are [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5506.04s)]
*  now? Will they just continue [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5508.04s)]
*  to lose territory? [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5510.04s)]
*  Do you have a sense of whether [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5512.04s)]
*  US intelligence support to [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5514.04s)]
*  Ukraine could get cut off? [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5516.04s)]
*  Yeah, you know, if the [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5518.04s)]
*  status quo is maintained, if nothing changes [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5520.04s)]
*  from today, where the Europeans and the [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5522.04s)]
*  Americans continue to provide weapons, [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5524.04s)]
*  continue to provide intelligence support, [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5526.04s)]
*  I think the situation on the ground largely [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5528.04s)]
*  remains the same. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5530.04s)]
*  We sometimes underappreciate the extent to which [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5532.04s)]
*  the Ukrainians have actually grown their own [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5534.04s)]
*  homegrown capacity to make stuff [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5536.04s)]
*  and to learn things. They're producing [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5538.04s)]
*  unbelievably capable drones. By the way, [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5540.04s)]
*  we can learn a lot. The Pentagon can [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5542.04s)]
*  learn a lot from what the Ukrainians have learned [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5544.04s)]
*  about drone warfare, something that, you know, [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5546.04s)]
*  until very recently, nobody in the Pentagon was thinking [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5548.04s)]
*  all that hard about. But so, [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5550.04s)]
*  you know, the sad fact is that [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5552.04s)]
*  with no change, you know, will the [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5554.04s)]
*  Russians pick up 100 yards here, 100 yards there? [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5556.04s)]
*  Yes. You know, will it be a slow [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5558.04s)]
*  and grinding war for many years [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5560.04s)]
*  until, you know, the Russian [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5562.04s)]
*  people have finally had it years down [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5564.04s)]
*  the road? Yes, that's a really [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5566.04s)]
*  ugly capacity. The alternative, of course, [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5568.04s)]
*  is two alternatives. Number [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5570.04s)]
*  one, let's finally give [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5572.04s)]
*  Zelensky, you know, unfettered [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5574.04s)]
*  access to weapons that can [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5576.04s)]
*  reach deep into Russia, right, to turn [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5578.04s)]
*  the course of this war around. Not that [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5580.04s)]
*  Zelensky is ever going to push the Russians back to the [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5582.04s)]
*  pre-conflict borders, but [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5584.04s)]
*  so that Putin finally realizes that [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5586.04s)]
*  we are there for the long [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5588.04s)]
*  haul and that this is going to be [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5590.04s)]
*  a losing venture for him, whether it's two, five, [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5592.04s)]
*  or ten years down the road. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5594.04s)]
*  The alternative, of course, is a really ugly one, [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5596.04s)]
*  which is that the United States, Donald Trump just [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5598.04s)]
*  gets sick of this, you know, marches [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5600.04s)]
*  away, you know, [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5602.04s)]
*  the 40 percent of the Republican [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5604.04s)]
*  conference in the House and in the Senate [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5606.04s)]
*  that continue to support Ukraine aren't enough [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5608.04s)]
*  to provide weaponry, and [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5610.04s)]
*  now the Russian incursion [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5612.04s)]
*  into Ukraine picks up speed, [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5614.04s)]
*  and, you know, do the [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5616.04s)]
*  Russians ultimately get to Kiev? No, I [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5618.04s)]
*  don't think so. You know, the Ukrainian people are [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5620.04s)]
*  going to, you know, go into caves [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5622.04s)]
*  with rifles before they give up their [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5624.04s)]
*  country, but [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5626.04s)]
*  Putin will have learned that the West [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5628.04s)]
*  does not have a backbone, and [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5630.04s)]
*  though he's in a lot of trouble now, five years [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5632.04s)]
*  from now, when he's got some domestic crisis [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5634.04s)]
*  and he decides he needs to invade a piece of [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5636.04s)]
*  Poland or Moldova or Estonia [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5638.04s)]
*  or Lithuania, he'll do [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5640.04s)]
*  it, he'll do it, because he will have learned [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5642.04s)]
*  that the West, courtesy [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5644.04s)]
*  of Donald Trump, doesn't have the [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5646.04s)]
*  traditional commitment [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5648.04s)]
*  to democracies and stability [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5650.04s)]
*  in Europe that we did since 1945. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5652.04s)]
*  And one worrisome [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5654.04s)]
*  sort of subplot of this war is you're seeing [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5656.04s)]
*  Russia and North Korea get closer [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5658.04s)]
*  and closer. North Korea is literally [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5660.04s)]
*  sending troops to fight on the battlefield [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5662.04s)]
*  against Ukraine, and then the Russians [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5664.04s)]
*  are reportedly providing some sort of military [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5666.04s)]
*  tech to North Korea in [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5668.04s)]
*  return. Do we know what that is, [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5670.04s)]
*  and how worried are you about that kind [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5672.04s)]
*  of changing the security situation [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5674.04s)]
*  for our allies in South Korea, [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5676.04s)]
*  Japan, and also, you know, for us in the US? [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5678.04s)]
*  Yeah, we are seeing things [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5680.04s)]
*  that [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5682.04s)]
*  would suggest, [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5684.04s)]
*  and I should be clear that I'm not [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5686.04s)]
*  current on the intelligence in this area, but we're [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5688.04s)]
*  seeing things, capabilities out of [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5690.04s)]
*  North Korea, missile capabilities, [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5692.04s)]
*  you know, as much as [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5694.04s)]
*  it was crazy to watch this new [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5696.04s)]
*  battleship fall over on its side [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5698.04s)]
*  in North Korea, we're [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5700.04s)]
*  seeing military capabilities that certainly [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5702.04s)]
*  look like they were provided by the Russians, and [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5704.04s)]
*  surprise, surprise, right? I mean, [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5706.04s)]
*  North Korea has lost hundreds, if not [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5708.04s)]
*  thousands of people in a [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5710.04s)]
*  conflict that they have no, [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5712.04s)]
*  you know, no particular [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5714.04s)]
*  reason to be involved in, [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5716.04s)]
*  and so, of course, there's a price for that, and of [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5718.04s)]
*  course, that price is in all likelihood going to be [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5720.04s)]
*  some combination of oil, [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5722.04s)]
*  commodities, and [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5724.04s)]
*  military know-how. So, yeah, that's [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5726.04s)]
*  a pretty ugly story because, [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5728.04s)]
*  you know, we always wonder [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5730.04s)]
*  whether North Korea is a [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5732.04s)]
*  deterrable country, right? You know, [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5734.04s)]
*  the leader there is, you know, [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5736.04s)]
*  particularly odd and [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5738.04s)]
*  ornery and prone to [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5740.04s)]
*  unpredictability, and so, [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5742.04s)]
*  you know, upping his capabilities as the Russians [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5744.04s)]
*  almost certainly are is not a happy [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5746.04s)]
*  thing for the region. No, not good. Also, I [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5748.04s)]
*  would not want to be the North Korean general [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5750.04s)]
*  in charge of that ship launch. There have been a couple [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5752.04s)]
*  of arrests there, yeah. I don't, [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5754.04s)]
*  I doubt the caliber of the legal [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5756.04s)]
*  representation those arrested are getting. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5758.04s)]
*  No, no. Kim Jong-un, I believe, is known [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5760.04s)]
*  to fire anti-aircraft guns at [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5762.04s)]
*  people he doesn't like. Last question for you. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5764.04s)]
*  There's been simmering [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5766.04s)]
*  tensions between China and Taiwan for a very [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5768.04s)]
*  long time. The date you often [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5770.04s)]
*  hear from military officials [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5772.04s)]
*  testifying before Congress about when [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5774.04s)]
*  the PLA, the Chinese military, [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5776.04s)]
*  might be prepared for some [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5778.04s)]
*  sort of operation against Taiwan is usually [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5780.04s)]
*  2027. Is that time frame [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5782.04s)]
*  still right to you? So, very, very [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5784.04s)]
*  good question. It's really important that we remember [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5786.04s)]
*  exactly what 2027 was about. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5788.04s)]
*  2027 is the date, and [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5790.04s)]
*  this was a couple of years ago, that President [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5792.04s)]
*  Xi ordered his military command [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5794.04s)]
*  to be ready to invade [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5796.04s)]
*  Taiwan by then. Now, remember, that's an order, [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5798.04s)]
*  and this is an unpracticed [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5800.04s)]
*  military. Hasn't fought a conflict since the 1970s. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5802.04s)]
*  They've watched very closely [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5804.04s)]
*  the Russian failure in Ukraine, right? [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5806.04s)]
*  And remember, you know, what the Russian, [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5808.04s)]
*  the experienced Russian military didn't do [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5810.04s)]
*  was try to cross a hundred miles of blue water. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5812.04s)]
*  And so, just because the, you know, [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5814.04s)]
*  President ordered the PLA [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5816.04s)]
*  to be able to take [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5818.04s)]
*  Taiwan in 2027 doesn't necessarily mean [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5820.04s)]
*  they're going to have the capability, [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5822.04s)]
*  which, by the way, doesn't mean there's any room for [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5824.04s)]
*  complacency there. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5826.04s)]
*  You, my own view, [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5828.04s)]
*  and there are people, you know, smarter than I am [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5830.04s)]
*  on this who disagree, but my own view is [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5832.04s)]
*  that the risk of an invasion is so [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5834.04s)]
*  huge, so unpredictable [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5836.04s)]
*  that it's going to be more a sort of, you know, [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5838.04s)]
*  heating the frog in the pan slowly [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5840.04s)]
*  kind of thing, you know? Take an island [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5842.04s)]
*  that is just off the mainland that [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5844.04s)]
*  belongs to Taiwan, put a naval [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5846.04s)]
*  blockade, you know, just to raise that temperature [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5848.04s)]
*  to try to, [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5850.04s)]
*  again, boil the frog [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5852.04s)]
*  without it jumping out of the pan, [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5854.04s)]
*  because, you know, Xi is very conscious [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5856.04s)]
*  of the capabilities of Indo-Pacom [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5858.04s)]
*  and the US military in the region. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5860.04s)]
*  So I personally am much more focused [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5862.04s)]
*  on this, you know, is there a blockade? [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5864.04s)]
*  Are there islands that are taken? Are there [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5866.04s)]
*  provocations that are set up that, you know, [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5868.04s)]
*  allows China to say they need to start [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5870.04s)]
*  flying their military aircraft [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5872.04s)]
*  over the island? That's frankly what [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5874.04s)]
*  worries me most right now. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5876.04s)]
*  Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5878.04s)]
*  Well, Congressman Himes, thank you so much for [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5880.04s)]
*  being so generous with your time in doing this [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5882.04s)]
*  tour of the region. I really appreciate it. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5884.04s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. Thanks for having me on. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5886.04s)]

*  before and was just like, I mean, this was [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5902.04s)]
*  like the kind of chemistry that [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5904.04s)]
*  Kat and Jalen Brunson have [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5906.04s)]
*  on the pick and roll. Like, he can just step in, [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5908.04s)]
*  you know, and get it done. I was going to say [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5910.04s)]
*  Sidney Sweeney and whatever the [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5912.04s)]
*  guy is. No, Ali's so smart. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5914.04s)]

*  I've hosted an episode of Hot [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5918.04s)]
*  Save America with him and I was like, oh, this [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5920.04s)]
*  is what a professional looks and sounds like. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5922.04s)]
*  I had the same thought. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5924.04s)]
*  He was so prepared. I was like, [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5926.04s)]
*  this is not his main job. He was just [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5928.04s)]
*  smooth, like just spoke with authority. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yo-tguSxco&t=5930.04s)]
