# Trump’s Tariffs Just Triggered a Global Economic Meltdown
**Pod Save the World:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI)
*  Welcome back to pot save the world on Tommy V tour. I'm Ben Rhodes [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=0.0s)]
*  You enjoy watching the stock market crash. I [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3.8200000000000003s)]
*  Have a tip for everyone who's looking at their 401k. You got to make sure you go to the wine store or the boo [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=6.74s)]
*  Store now. Yeah, if you're buying anything from overseas because it's about to get terrible. I did that by the way [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  as a [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=17.82s)]
*  The man who enjoys a glass of Bordeaux every afternoon evening. I know your style. I definitely went after that [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=19.06s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know how long I was thinking today [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=25.46s)]
*  I noticed today that the front page of the Times doesn't have the ticker anymore [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=27.779999999999998s)]
*  Like I was wondering how long we can watch this go down in real time. I did throw on [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=31.7s)]
*  It was gonna throw in margin call [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=38.5s)]
*  My favorite financial crisis movie. Oh, okay those those those days good. It's a good movie [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=40.66s)]
*  Um, I went to the boo store the other day. I asked the guy if they were people were hoarding [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=45.94s)]
*  Foreign European wines yet. He said not quite yet [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=51.099999999999994s)]
*  Then I noticed a rum called crossfire hurricane which I felt like they're definitely [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=53.74s)]
*  They're gonna get tariffed Ben. First of all, I should say thank you to everyone who subscribed to the pod save the world YouTube [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=58.02s)]
*  Yes, we need you to subscribe. We're over the 100,000 mark actually 102,000 [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=63.540000000000006s)]
*  Like I said, you know when I begged you last time we are trying to catch up to like the daily wire [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=68.58s)]
*  TP USA these horrible right-wing outlets that have massive YouTube presences. So we're putting more exclusive content on YouTube [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=74.58s)]
*  We're trying to really focus there because a lot of young people use YouTube as a search engine and what they find is [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=82.52000000000001s)]
*  Awful conservative content. No crooked media has got to get in the game. We got to get in the game guys [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=88.04s)]
*  I I've had some people dunk on me recently for you know, the well look at TP USA. Where are you guys? You know? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=93.08000000000001s)]
*  Also, we're gonna try something a little different in today's episode [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=101.4s)]
*  So we're gonna do a couple fewer topics with the goal of going deeper into each one of them [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=103.76s)]
*  Listeners are probably noticed that we tend to have like kind of a really long top of the show [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=109.58s)]
*  And then there's lots of things where we like maybe check the box at the end which we want to do because there's a million things [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=114.02000000000001s)]
*  We could discuss every week [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=119.46000000000001s)]
*  But sometimes we feel like there's more value when we have more of a discussion into fewer things [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=120.58000000000001s)]
*  So I don't know tell us what you think and there's some pretty big things going on that it's hard to deal with in a couple [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=125.26s)]
*  minutes, yeah, there's some meaty meaty stuff like [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=130.86s)]
*  Liberation day happy liberation day by the way, I didn't tell you yet. It feels like that was a week ago [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=133.70000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, feels like a long time ago like a year ago. So we're gonna talk about liberation day Trump's tariffs [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=137.7s)]
*  We'll talk about how a fringe right-wing lunatic named Laura Loomer is literally [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=141.82s)]
*  Dictating national security personnel decisions at the White House [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=147.22s)]
*  We'll cover the news out of even in Yahoo's visit to the White House on Monday [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=150.38s)]
*  Why people are concerned about a civil war in South Sudan? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=155.14s)]
*  The president of South Korea was finally removed from office months after he declared martial law [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=158.29999999999998s)]
*  We'll tell you the backstory there and what might come next and what it means for US-South Korea relations [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=163.85999999999999s)]
*  And then we're gonna look to Europe then for some laughs [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=168.85999999999999s)]
*  always [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=172.34s)]
*  Europe and Australia [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=173.34s)]
*  Always a good source. Yeah, love love the Aussies some weird shit happening with European leaders that we're gonna dig into [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=175.06s)]
*  Yes, and then then you're gonna hear my interview with Noah Bullock [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=181.78s)]
*  He's the executive director of crystal saw which is a human rights organization that is based in El Salvador [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=184.57999999999998s)]
*  he's based in El Salvador and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=190.74s)]
*  Noah has been [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=192.98000000000002s)]
*  Looking at naive O'Kelly's regime for a very long time and it's watched the way he has used [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=194.62s)]
*  The state of exception the suspension of due process and constitutional rights for citizens there to sweep people up [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=200.42000000000002s)]
*  Throw like 2% of the population into these prisons, which has made the country safer [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=207.70000000000002s)]
*  But has led to this, you know incredibly authoritarian oppressive regime [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=212.78s)]
*  So we talked about these prisons because the obvious most recent context is the United States sending Venezuelan men down [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=217.70000000000002s)]
*  Into these transnational gulags with no due process [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=224.70000000000002s)]
*  But we also talked about the role of these prisons in Bukele's regime how it props him up and also his [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=227.42000000000002s)]
*  foreign policy views like how we went from kind of like Bitcoin guy to [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=233.10000000000002s)]
*  Trump stooge to CPAC [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=237.34s)]
*  Attendee so really really interesting conversation and he had some I thought just like [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=240.3s)]
*  Really thoughtful smart observations about [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=246.38000000000002s)]
*  What that kind of system does to a population over time and the comparisons to the slow erosion of rights? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=250.18s)]
*  We're seeing in the US. Yeah and something that we all need to learn more about so people should definitely listen to this one [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=255.54000000000002s)]
*  Definitely, but let's start with the tariffs Ben because it was liberation day [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=261.14s)]
*  Where President Trump finally rolled out his tariffs and if you're a lover of global economic chaos boy, did it deliver? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=265.74s)]
*  Here's what Trump announced there's a universal 10% tariff that took effect April 5th [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=272.58000000000004s)]
*  Then there are country specific tariffs on over 180 countries that go into effect on April 9th [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=276.54s)]
*  So tomorrow when this comes out the way the White House determined the tariff rate on each country was this nutty formula [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=281.66s)]
*  Based on each country's trade deficit with the United States, which makes no sense [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=288.06s)]
*  Also Russia and North Korea Cuba and Belarus were exempted from the tariffs as long as we're cataloging things [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=292.26s)]
*  They don't really make any sense [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=298.38s)]
*  For those who are like what's the tariff a tariff is just a tax on an imported good the company importing the tariff pays the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=299.86s)]
*  Tariff so if you're like Ben you want some French wine an importer purchases that wine they pay the tariff [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=306.26s)]
*  That Trump slapped on you know, whatever Bordeaux and then the importer will almost certainly pass that cost along to me [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=313.34000000000003s)]
*  Then the consumers in the form of higher prices [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=321.34000000000003s)]
*  Tariffs were the main way the US collected revenue through the early 1900s in [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=324.3s)]
*  1913 the 16th amendment gave Congress the power to levy and collect income taxes which over time became the main source of federal revenue [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=328.18s)]
*  Presidents from both parties have put in place targeted tariffs like on Chinese imports of steel or tires or electric vehicles [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=334.78000000000003s)]
*  But what Trump did again was take each country's trade deficit with the US [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=342.7s)]
*  Divided by the country's exports to the US and then divide by two to get the rate [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=347.34000000000003s)]
*  We're gonna tariff them which former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said the process was quote to economics [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=351.42s)]
*  What creationism is to biology astrology is to astronomy or RFK thought is to vaccine science good quote from Larry [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=357.7s)]
*  Oh Larry good machine good tweet from Larry in practice [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=364.7s)]
*  This math has a slapping 50% tariffs on tiny little countries like Lesotho [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=368.12s)]
*  41% tariff on Syria and then massive tariffs on a lot of our biggest allies [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=372.65999999999997s)]
*  According to Treasury Secretary Scott Besson more than 50 countries have approached the US about cutting a deal though [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=377.26s)]
*  Nothing has been inked yet. The EU has offered to go to zero tariffs for zero tariffs. I just get rid of them all [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=382.65999999999997s)]
*  But they're also preparing to retaliate [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=390.02s)]
*  There are some key EU members like Italy though that seemingly don't want to retaliate against the Trump administration [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=392.65999999999997s)]
*  China however is spoiling for a fight [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=398.78s)]
*  They said they're gonna impose a reciprocal tariff of 34% on US products [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=401.0s)]
*  Which Trump threatened to respond to with another 50% tariff? So then [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=404.92s)]
*  Everybody is trying to make sense of like what Trump is doing here. Do you have a theory of the case? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=410.28s)]
*  My theory of the case on why he's doing it and we can get into the ramifications [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=415.92s)]
*  I mentioned you Tommy that for this book I've been working on I [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=420.9s)]
*  Unfortunately had to go back and read [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=426.28s)]
*  Trump's announcement speech for a president in 2015 people will remember that he rode down the escalator Trump Tower [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=428.59999999999997s)]
*  People usually remember the line where he talks about Mexicans bringing in rapists and stuff [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=434.79999999999995s)]
*  But actually like the preponderance of that speech an extraordinary amount of it like three-quarters of it is about terrors [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=439.32s)]
*  It's about trade deficits and this is a guy whose worldview was [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=445.59999999999997s)]
*  Born in the 1980s when people were pissed that the Japanese were doing better than us economically [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=451.15999999999997s)]
*  He seems to genuinely [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=457.96000000000004s)]
*  Believe he's figured something out wherein you know [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=460.76s)]
*  you leverage tariffs to compel countries to do what you want and you kind of [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=464.56s)]
*  Orchestrate engineer the global economy as you'd like it to be so in Trump's mind. It's like it's like some real estate deal [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=470.88s)]
*  you know somebody sitting across the table from you and you want them to do something and so you pose a penalty on them and [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=477.84000000000003s)]
*  therefore they [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=483.52000000000004s)]
*  Start buying more your stuff and then you're making that stuff in the US and everything is great [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=485.0s)]
*  the problem is the world doesn't work like a [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=490.32s)]
*  Bilateral real estate transaction, you know different countries have different interests different countries have different resources [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=494.35999999999996s)]
*  Different countries have different politics different systems [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=500.64s)]
*  You you can't sit in Washington and enter a terror formula into like a chat GPT model [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=504.47999999999996s)]
*  Which they might have done and yeah, which it seems like they did and and reengineered the whole global economy in a couple years [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=510.24s)]
*  You know, that's just not how it works [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=517.32s)]
*  It just it digs that a little bit like what he seems to be primarily mad about is trade deficits [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=519.4s)]
*  Meaning like we buy more which is not than you buy bars. Yeah. Yeah, but if you're a country that [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=523.84s)]
*  Your export is bananas. Yeah, we're never who we're never gonna make enough bananas on our own [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=528.44s)]
*  Right, the United States is not gonna have a banana industry. Yeah, like this is the lot. There's no logic here [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=533.96s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I've really earnestly tried me too. Maybe that's a mistake [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=539.2s)]
*  No, and people listen to the podcast or like the stuff I've been writing since the election, you know [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=543.72s)]
*  I this issue of [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=549.0400000000001s)]
*  globalization and deindustrialization and decades and decades of working-class communities in this country being ravaged by [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=551.32s)]
*  Job losses and and and globalization [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=559.72s)]
*  That's a real problem [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=563.08s)]
*  This is just not the answer though [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=564.72s)]
*  I think sometimes people think that because Trump figured out a way to speak to people that have been harmed by free trade [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=566.56s)]
*  harmed by deindustrialization [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=573.1999999999999s)]
*  That that means he understands it right it means he understands how to demagogue it [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=574.9599999999999s)]
*  This is not the the answer to the challenges that he's diagnosing, right and [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=580.4799999999999s)]
*  You're not going to bring back [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=586.64s)]
*  manufacturing to the industrial Midwest by putting tariffs on [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=589.7199999999999s)]
*  Random African countries, you know, you're not going to [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=595.16s)]
*  Isolate China for its unfair trade practices what China does is like plows [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=598.8000000000001s)]
*  State subsidies into certain industries deals in actual property. It does things that that are bad that deserve to be called out [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=603.4s)]
*  You're not gonna solve that problem by putting like near 50% tariffs on [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=609.72s)]
*  Southeast Asian countries that are the alternative supply chains to China like everything he's doing is kind of in [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=615.08s)]
*  conflict with his stated objectives [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=621.28s)]
*  and and the bigger problem is and where we should spend some time is it is just [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=623.98s)]
*  disappearing not eroding disappearing any [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=631.1800000000001s)]
*  global confidence in the United States as the kind of central hub of [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=634.5400000000001s)]
*  the global economy and global financial system which we've been since World War two and [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=639.02s)]
*  It is going to rapidly accelerate countries moving away from that and isolate us because what why would countries say? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=643.6600000000001s)]
*  Okay, mr. Trump, you know we come out we're gonna ship our factories back to the United States [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=651.42s)]
*  There's no place you're gonna start but you know, even that the the jobs that are lost. We're not gonna do [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=656.9s)]
*  Textiles and we're not gonna assemble iPhones and that's just not a workforce that we have anymore [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=662.86s)]
*  Anyway, even if you know we wanted to and if if we did want to do that that would take 20 years to to regenerate [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=668.18s)]
*  You know, so this is just not this is him responding to [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=673.9799999999999s)]
*  Like a worldview he already had a [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=678.9399999999999s)]
*  Political constituency that he effectively identified angry white working-class people largely, but not just white but angry working-class people in this country [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=682.26s)]
*  About globalization but but then like the remedy the medicine as he says [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=690.46s)]
*  Is just the wrong it's like telling people to drink bleach during fucking kovat [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=695.8199999999999s)]
*  It doesn't make sense like targeted tariffs can help protect an industry one industry, right or like help you grow a nascent industry [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=700.14s)]
*  But like just tariffing everyone is not gonna do that [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=707.5s)]
*  It has to be coupled with some sort of industrial policy and investment like the Chinese do by the way [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=710.26s)]
*  Like the Chips Act was from Joe Biden that he now says he wants to get rid of yeah [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=715.82s)]
*  And all the other problem with this is like, okay [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=719.26s)]
*  I've been trying to I probably spent way too much time trying to understand this too and rationalize it and sane wash it [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=721.34s)]
*  Yeah, I assume he's just trying to exert leverage to cut deals [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=726.42s)]
*  But his what he wants is so all over the place like for example, the European Union was like, alright, you don't like our tariffs [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=730.14s)]
*  Let's go zero tariffs to zero tariffs, right? Like basically free trade and Trump said no, that's not enough [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=736.94s)]
*  He wants the EU to buy 350 billion dollars worth of energy from the United States like okay [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=741.62s)]
*  That's coming out of absolutely nowhere. So we're again, we're just trying to zero out the trade deficit and you know [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=746.86s)]
*  I keep beating this drum [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=752.0200000000001s)]
*  like the most confusing part of this is the China piece because [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=753.4200000000001s)]
*  If China is the real threat and that's what he ran on and that's where there's a bipartisan consensus in Washington [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=757.34s)]
*  Hammering all of our allies is not gonna help us deal with China. And also Ben if you look at these news reports [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=762.88s)]
*  The Chinese are telling people that they're trying to get meetings with the Trump administration in camp [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=769.6s)]
*  And I've talked to people directly who have talked to the Chinese who say they're like they want to meet with waltz or rubio [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=774.3199999999999s)]
*  Or like someone on staff they can't get a meeting or they're like running up against some [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=780.9599999999999s)]
*  grifter or hanger on who's trying to sell him or herself as like a [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=785.64s)]
*  Line into the Trump administration because they have a Mar-a-Lago membership or there's just you know [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=789.88s)]
*  a bunch of kind of crazy hardliners in the administration and [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=794.96s)]
*  They like the the Chinese are like we're not gonna put [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=798.88s)]
*  Xi Jinping just directly into a conversation or a meeting with Trump unless it has a clear agenda [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=802.88s)]
*  And an endgame because no one wants to get Zelensky'd [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=808.56s)]
*  You know and have fucking JD Vance pissing on your leg from the other couch as like Marjorie Taylor Greene's [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=811.88s)]
*  Boyfriend yells at you about your outfit right like yeah, that's not a context. They're gonna go for yeah [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=819.12s)]
*  I guess I'd summarize my concerns beyond the crashing market, which I'll you know end on [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=823.72s)]
*  First none of these countries know what the deal is that they are supposed to be striking so [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=830.4399999999999s)]
*  He's and I've talked to people and mainly in Europe, but they have no idea what they're supposed to be doing [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=837.0s)]
*  Yeah, what do you want what they want? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=843.18s)]
*  What does Trump want right and and that's that that leads the second point which is it is creating this kind of massive uncertainty [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=845.28s)]
*  Even if Trump like lifted all these tariffs tomorrow [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=852.44s)]
*  I think the damage is already done because no one will ever trust the United certainly not while Trump is president [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=854.88s)]
*  We'll ever trust the United States to be a reliable trading partner a relying reliable steward of the global economy [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=859.5600000000001s)]
*  So in addition to everything else what you're gonna see is other countries are just gonna begin to try to insulate themselves in the United States [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=864.52s)]
*  So rather than got reshoring things the United States [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=869.96s)]
*  They're gonna try to have alternative supply chains alternative trade agreements alternative trade blocs that exclude us [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=872.28s)]
*  So that's really gonna hurt us in the long run to it to your China point that includes countries like Vietnam has been very careful [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=877.9599999999999s)]
*  I remember when we were negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership Trade Agreement, which Trump killed [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=884.88s)]
*  The Vietnamese I looked at a graph of their export import relationships [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=890.4s)]
*  They were very careful to have kind of the exact match of US China Europe. They wanted to diversify [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=895.24s)]
*  They didn't want to be overly reliant on China. So they made a point of exporting to the United States [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=900.96s)]
*  They were hedging against China [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=906.72s)]
*  They want to be a part of our China strategy because they they fear a large powerful China right above them that has historical antagonism to them [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=908.44s)]
*  This is just us pushing them into the Chinese [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=915.96s)]
*  If you are a Southeast Asian country now, you're gonna want to sell your stuff to the Chinese and you're gonna therefore need to buy stuff from [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=919.44s)]
*  the Chinese [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=925.0s)]
*  That means we're gonna pay higher prices [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=926.08s)]
*  We're not gonna get investment from those like this is not gonna work in that regard and even on the China piece [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=927.92s)]
*  You know that the Chinese had this statement out today when Trump threatened higher terrorists where he said like [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=933.56s)]
*  The Chinese said we will fight to the death or something like that. They will I mean to take a bigger view of history [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=938.76s)]
*  This is a Chinese Communist Party that lived through Mao Zedong. They lived through a famine. They lived through a cultural revolution [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=945.8s)]
*  I'm no fan of theirs, but the idea that they're gonna change their entire model to please mr [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=951.12s)]
*  Trump who's gone? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=956.66s)]
*  He's at one term who's gonna be gone in four years when the Chinese Communist Party knows they're gonna be there in four years [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=957.5799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's not gonna happen and that's just illustrative of how little he understands the countries he's dealing with [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=961.6999999999999s)]
*  He doesn't understand the Southeast Asian countries desire to have a hedge against China. He doesn't understand China's [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=966.6999999999999s)]
*  Belief that their staying power is their advantage over us. He doesn't understand that the Europeans [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=974.9s)]
*  It's the trust that they had in the United States [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=981.1s)]
*  It is a core of the Alliance not some brute force burden-sharing that he forces on them [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=983.46s)]
*  And so this is going to have immediate impacts in terms of a potential global economic crisis [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=988.1800000000001s)]
*  That is already unfolding before our eyes [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=994.14s)]
*  But beyond that it's going to remake the global economy away from the United States things like the dollars or reserve currency [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=996.3000000000001s)]
*  Are going to come into question because why is everyone who trades in the dollar? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1003.1s)]
*  The person who's sitting on charge of the economy in the United States is weaponizing that to fuck everybody in the world [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1006.74s)]
*  So this it's hard to overstate the impact that this could have over over many years [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1012.86s)]
*  Not just the the kind of weird, you know stock market freefall of living through [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1018.1s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's just two final observations on this like not that Trump gives a shit [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1022.3000000000001s)]
*  But there's an organization called the International Trade Union Confederation global rights. They do an index of [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1026.6200000000001s)]
*  The countries that score the worst in terms of like conditions for workers in that country [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1033.46s)]
*  Of the 89 countries that scored the worst in their index about half of them got awarded the Trump administration's lowest tariff rate [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1039.5s)]
*  So like the worst human rights abusers are getting the lowest tariffs again [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1046.82s)]
*  I know he doesn't care but it's just kind of telling and then finally I keep banging on this but [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1050.1799999999998s)]
*  The the legal authority that Trump is using. Oh, yeah, this is important put in place this tariff. It's crazy [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1055.86s)]
*  So they're using a law called IE but it's the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1061.74s)]
*  It gives the president the authority to regulate international commerce in response to a national emergency abroad [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1066.78s)]
*  It's mostly used to freeze assets or impose sanctions [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1073.52s)]
*  On individuals or foreign governments Trump is essentially declaring an emergency all over the world [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1077.02s)]
*  Yeah [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1083.62s)]
*  And using it to create a de facto tax on every single American really on every single citizen in the world [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1084.06s)]
*  In a way that has never been used before [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1091.18s)]
*  Yeah, ever ever and it's an important reminder that the kind of authoritarian stuff that we talk about is fundamentally connected to everything else [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1093.18s)]
*  because the reason that there's checks and balances set up so that presidents can't abuse authorities like this is because [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1100.5s)]
*  This would never get through Congress. This would never get through even with his compliant Republican Congress [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1107.98s)]
*  They would never pass these tariffs into law never but because he's abusing his power [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1112.8200000000002s)]
*  He's able to do things that the system would usually prevent him from doing [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1117.22s)]
*  It's in and I actually think it's kind of an indictment of the US kind of war on terror era [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1121.7s)]
*  That that he's using some of those [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1128.06s)]
*  authorities on sanctions have been I think already overused by presidents including, you know, President Obama when we were there and [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1131.9s)]
*  He's now just driving a fucking truck through the opening that was created by those authorities in the same way that he is [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1140.38s)]

*  I mean, this is your thinking about trade deficits like [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1183.82s)]
*  The people in Lesotho can't buy American goods. They can't afford them. So of course there's a trade deficit. It's crazy [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1186.3s)]
*  Okay, then speaking of crazy [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1193.4199999999998s)]
*  If the global economy wasn't melting down, I do feel like this would be like the biggest story in Washington, which is that this? [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1195.34s)]
*  fringe right-wing [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1202.1399999999999s)]
*  conspiracy theory lunatic named Laura Loomer [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1204.1399999999999s)]

*  So just a quick one to one on Laura Loomer [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1213.02s)]
*  Listeners might remember the time she literally chained herself to Twitter's office door in New York to protest getting banned from the platform [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1215.82s)]
*  I don't know if you remember this Ben [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1223.08s)]
*  She was wearing a star of David at the time to compare her treatment by Twitter [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1224.6999999999998s)]
*  I do remember that to that of the Jews during the Holocaust seems comparable seems like someone who has seen some perspective [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1228.5s)]
*  Yeah, she said 9-eleven was an inside job [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1234.46s)]
*  She celebrated the deaths of Muslim refugees who drowned while trying to cross the Mediterranean [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1236.6200000000001s)]
*  Including children. I think she tweeted the clapping hands emoji saying more of that [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1242.38s)]
*  She's a truly vile person. But despite all of that context last week [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1246.38s)]
*  Donald Trump took 30 minutes out of his day on liberation day of all days to meet with Laura Loomer where I guess she ranted in [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1251.42s)]
*  The Oval Office about the loyalty of various national security staffers and did it in front of Trump Mike Waltz [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1258.1s)]
*  National Security Advisor Chief of Staff Susie Wiles and JD Vance who I believe is still the vice president [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1265.54s)]
*  Although it's not clear might be Elon Musk the next day the firings began including the senior director for intelligence [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1271.02s)]
*  The NSC ledge affairs person the senior director for technology and national security the senior director for international organizations and then later [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1277.3799999999999s)]
*  Timothy D how the head of the National Security Agency or NSA and also US Cyber Command along with Wendy Noble his deputy so [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1285.8200000000002s)]
*  Then I just want to make sure our listeners understand how senior influential these positions are [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1293.5800000000002s)]
*  Obviously like people are probably heard of the NSA that is the organization in charge of collecting signals intelligence [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1299.66s)]
*  They intercept phone calls and emails etc. They're probably responsible for what 75 80% of the intelligence consumed by you know policy makers [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1305.5800000000002s)]
*  They also conduct for this. They also conduct offensive cyber operations [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1314.38s)]
*  That leadership was decapitated and then the NSC roles like those are also incredibly influential [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1319.0200000000002s)]
*  The NSC senior director for intelligence is the person in the White House overseeing the intelligence agencies [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1325.26s)]
*  covert action programs all like the most sensitive detail sources and methods collection [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1331.38s)]
*  Technology like all the shit. I don't even know anymore [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1337.74s)]
*  That person's gone. Thanks to Laura Loomer. Um, this is like it's [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1339.9s)]
*  It's almost funny because it's so absurd but is really chilling stuff because these people like is she gonna get to pick who comes next? [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1344.7s)]
*  We have no idea [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1350.98s)]
*  It's a truly troubling story because what it tells you is that in the second iteration of the Trump administration [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1352.38s)]
*  He is listening to this wing of his party on [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1360.42s)]
*  Everything there's no Jim Madison. There's no Jim Mattis. There's no [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1365.8600000000001s)]

*  Who's as any listeners to this show will know we're no fans of Mike Pompeo [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1373.38s)]
*  You're part of what's going on here. Is that when Trump? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1377.46s)]
*  staffed up his [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1380.5400000000002s)]
*  administration [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1382.42s)]
*  You'll remember that they didn't like these kind of extreme MAGA people like Laura Loomer didn't like the Rubio choice, right for state [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1383.5800000000002s)]
*  They wanted Rick Grinnell. They wanted a true MAGA guy in there. Grinnell didn't get the job, you know pour enough our right now [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1389.5800000000002s)]
*  And you know, but they got kind of you know, there's a guess, you know scattering of lunatics around the National Security Enterprise [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1395.18s)]
*  And then you get Mike waltz and then there's this guy Alex Wong [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1402.82s)]
*  Who's the deputy national security advisor who is like a pretty conventional right-winger? [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1405.5s)]
*  He worked for Tom Cotton in the Senate. He worked in the first Trump administration on like I think Korea issues and [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1410.6999999999998s)]
*  He's seen as by the Loomers of the world [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1418.54s)]
*  suspiciously [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1422.3799999999999s)]
*  Conventional. Yeah, she went after him. Yeah, she went after him didn't get a scout [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1423.74s)]
*  But all these people were kind of you know, I talked to people in Washington like these were like the [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1427.22s)]
*  Alex Wong people at the NSC, you know the kind of professional coaching tree [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1433.18s)]
*  And by the way, not people that you and I agree on about most things, you know [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1438.22s)]
*  They're kind of neocons or they're kind of hard-ass China hawks [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1442.0600000000002s)]
*  But they're just not lunatics. They're just not like burn it all down [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1445.8200000000002s)]
*  Laura Loomer type, you know foreign policy people or even they're not like the JD Vance flavor. They live in reality [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1448.9s)]
*  They live in reality, you know, and and so the first thing that this tells you is that [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1454.3s)]
*  Trump like one meeting with Laura Loomer and suddenly like he's just clearing the brush of [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1458.94s)]
*  Anybody that isn't kind of maga-pilled completely even if they're pretty hard right-wingers, right? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1465.74s)]
*  Then if you look at the jobs are in as you say the NSA the the director of the National Security Agency [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1472.3799999999999s)]
*  He his head rolled like the next day too. So you're talking about the people in charge of like intelligence [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1478.14s)]
*  The National Security Agency like, you know signals intelligence, you know people and a see that are responsible for [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1483.54s)]
*  Things like export controls that sound wonky, but that's basically how do sense of technologies military technologies AI [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1490.46s)]
*  Move out into the world [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1497.7s)]
*  Massive portfolios that are just left empty so that he can appease and give a scalp to Laura Loomer by the way [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1499.5s)]
*  At the exact same time that he upends the American relationship with every country in the world through tariffs [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1506.6200000000001s)]
*  He then fires some of the people that would normally have to come in behind and try to clean up that mess and figure things out [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1512.58s)]
*  Never mind that these are also the people that are in charge of some of the most sensitive issues like AI and you know [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1519.6599999999999s)]
*  intelligence relationships, so [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1525.22s)]
*  And Mike Waltz their boss is so [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1528.3799999999999s)]
*  Embarrassed and neutered by the signal gate scandal and inviting Jeffrey Goldberg to be in all his little chats about [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1531.62s)]
*  Classified information that he just he can't defend them [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1538.34s)]
*  Well, if you think about it now, you've got Marco Rubio who's basically an intern at the State Department, right? [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1540.82s)]
*  You've got Mike Waltz who? [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1545.06s)]
*  You know, he literally just got neutered because he argued against firing these people and these are his staff and Laura Loomer fired them basically [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1547.84s)]
*  Who's in charge? You know, it's Trump [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1555.86s)]
*  It's just Trump and what's in his head and who he just talked to and then it's JD Vance who seems to have kind of [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1558.12s)]
*  Wiggled his way into foreign policy pretty effectively [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1564.1s)]
*  It's Steve Wittgoff who is accepting paintings of Donald Trump from Weimar Putin and leading the Iran talks [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1566.64s)]
*  It's in leading the Iran talks. It's Pete Hegseth who is you know, trying to get rid of women in combat [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1573.0s)]
*  He's doing burpees and like dropping emojis into signal chats [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1578.76s)]
*  like this it's a it's Trump Vance Hegseth Wittgoff like this is [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1583.68s)]

*  Not good not good [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1595.84s)]
*  But also like it's just I think it's good to highlight this and to watch this stuff [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1597.44s)]
*  because if there is an intelligence failure or something bad happens something slips through the cracks like we absolutely all need to point to [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1601.76s)]
*  This bloodletting from Laura Loomer that pushed out all these competent people and created chaos in the midst of as you mentioned like a [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1609.68s)]
*  An economic crisis and God knows what else is happening behind the scenes that we don't know about [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1617.52s)]
*  Yeah, and can I bring one more scary thing to this conversation since I guess it's that kind of day post-liberation day [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1620.88s)]
*  The Trump presidency just happens to align with the four years in which AI is going to move out into the world. Yep [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1626.64s)]
*  That's already troubling enough [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1633.5200000000002s)]
*  These were the kind of a semi adults that were going to competently manage that now they're gone [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1635.5200000000002s)]

*  We could have an economic crisis that is followed by mass economic and job displacement from a [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1644.3200000000002s)]
*  Followed by like an AI arms race in the world between American and Chinese AI [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1649.28s)]
*  You would think you would want some competent people just kind of running this store [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1653.6s)]
*  Because Trump probably doesn't have strong views on these things. And so that's just another thing to watch [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1659.04s)]
*  Yeah, not good. All right, we're gonna take a quick break Ben [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1663.68s)]

*  All right, ben [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1874.74s)]
*  So israeli prime minister bb netanyahu was in washington on monday to meet with trump do as usual [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1875.2199999999998s)]
*  Uh ass kissing and groveling session [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1880.82s)]
*  The funny part of it all was israel preemptively got rid of all their tariffs on the united states and trump still [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1883.54s)]
*  Slapped them with a 17 tariff in return during the meeting. There was like this extended q a with reporters [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1889.06s)]
*  Netanyahu promised to eliminate israel's trade deficit with america [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1896.1s)]
*  But even that couldn't get trump to commit to getting rid of tariffs on israel [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1899.46s)]
*  So now russia russia got a pass. Yeah, russia got a great relationship there [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1903.62s)]
*  I went asked directly if trump would give israel concessions on trade trump responded [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1906.6599999999999s)]
*  Don't forget we help israel a lot and then he turned to bb and said congratulations, by the way [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1910.82s)]
*  I'm ringing all this cash out of the u.s. Which I honestly I laughed [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1915.1399999999999s)]
*  Uh trump also rehashed his plan for gaza. Let's listen [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1919.22s)]
*  I think it's [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1923.1399999999999s)]
*  an incredible piece of [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1924.5s)]
*  important real estate [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1926.56s)]
*  and I think it's something that [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1928.34s)]
*  We would be involved in but you know having a peace force like the united states there [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1930.6599999999999s)]
*  Controlling and owning the gaza strip would be a good thing [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1936.56s)]
*  Because right now all it is is for years and years all I hear about is killing and hamas and problems [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1939.62s)]
*  And if you take the people the palestinians and move them around to different countries and you have plenty of countries that will [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1946.4199999999998s)]
*  Do that [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1953.06s)]
*  And you really have a freedom a freedom zone. You call it the freedom zone [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1954.26s)]
*  I don't understand why israel ever gave it up israel owned it. It wasn't this man so I can say it [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1958.74s)]
*  He wouldn't have given it up. I know him very well. There's no way [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1964.34s)]
*  They took oceanfront property and they gave it to people for peace. How did that work out? Not good? [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1968.1000000000001s)]
*  So that was a thoughtful take on gaza and then trump expressed surprise that hamas is not nice [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1974.5s)]
*  Let's listen to that part. You know, I had people right in this office this beautiful oval office [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1981.22s)]
*  They came in 10 people hostages, you know that [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1985.3000000000002s)]
*  And I said to him, uh, so how was it and the stories they told me I mean as an example [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1988.74s)]
*  I said to them did the hamas [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1995.1399999999999s)]
*  Show any signs of like help or liking you? [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=1998.34s)]
*  Did they wink at you? Did they give you a piece of bread extra? Did they give you? [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2002.98s)]
*  A meal on the side like you know you think of doing like what happened in germany would happen elsewhere people would [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2007.3s)]
*  Try and help people that were in [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2014.26s)]
*  Unbelievable distress [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2016.56s)]
*  They said no, I said all of them [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2018.26s)]
*  I said did they have a wink at you like you'll be okay. You're gonna be okay. No, they didn't do that. They'd slap us [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2020.74s)]
*  The hatred is unbelievable [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2027.22s)]
*  So what is the german reference? [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2030.02s)]
*  Because the germans killed six million jews. He does seem to think the nazis were nice, which is troubling [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2032.58s)]
*  That's very troubling. He's also surprised that the terrorist organization hamas is cruel to people [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2038.5s)]
*  So the big news out of this meeting was iran. Uh, we'll get to that in a second [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2044.58s)]
*  But I did think it was worth reminding listeners that trump is still pledging to ethnically cleanse [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2048.7400000000002s)]
*  And then occupy militarily the gaza strip and then also [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2053.78s)]
*  That part was very weird that he he seems to think the nazis were nice. Yeah, sorry [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2057.3s)]
*  I missed that the first time that's why I just had this reaction of like the like the germans the germans i mean [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2062.5s)]
*  They were hiding some people not enough obviously in [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2068.58s)]
*  You know other european countries, but I don't really remember the you know [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2073.2200000000003s)]
*  Maybe he saw schindler's list. I was gonna say yeah, that's probably his understanding. I think he was chancellor. Yeah, they'll look [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2078.5s)]
*  He referred to gaza as a piece of real estate [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2085.94s)]
*  Um, I I I don't think you'd usually refer to other countries as real estate. No [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2088.7400000000002s)]
*  So there's a kind of dehumanization there [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2094.02s)]
*  He referred to america owning it [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2096.82s)]
*  Um, I don't know what that means like to take ownership of this land like [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2100.82s)]
*  Like it's a development [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2105.4599999999996s)]
*  There are people that live there. They're human beings that live there. There are men women and children who [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2106.9799999999996s)]
*  Have lived there for either generations or they got displaced her in the first place [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2111.54s)]
*  Then he suggested it was israel's and they gave it back [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2115.3799999999997s)]
*  you know, it was [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2118.4199999999996s)]
*  illegally occupied by israel for a period of time [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2119.7s)]
*  And some settlements were built and then under errol charron, not exactly a peacenik [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2122.58s)]
*  I know they decided to pull out of gaza [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2127.2999999999997s)]
*  so there's [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2130.5s)]
*  so much historical [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2131.62s)]
*  Inaccuracy and revisionism on the most sensitive issue in the world and then there's this completely implausible idea of a u.s [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2133.3s)]
*  I mean he's proposing a u.s military force there. It wasn't ambiguous because those always go well [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2140.9s)]
*  It's always simple like we and then we're moving the palestinians around. Uh [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2146.5800000000004s)]
*  What's scary is that he he keeps coming back to this like tariffs [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2151.7000000000003s)]
*  It seems like he really believes this and so this add this to the list of things that we [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2155.54s)]
*  Probably should take both seriously and literally. Yeah, and you just kind of have to keep an eye on we should mention bed that there was some [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2160.1s)]
*  Really awful reporting. Uh, I think the new york times had this about the killing of 15 rescue workers in gaza [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2165.22s)]
*  Just briefly. I mean on march 23rd, israeli forces killed six members of gaza's civil defense emergency unit [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2171.54s)]
*  This is an unrest after there were eight red crescent workers [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2177.7s)]
*  And then they buried them in a mass grave the idf claimed that the ambulances were [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2181.7799999999997s)]
*  Advancing suspiciously they didn't have headlights on or emergency lights on and they said that's why they opened fire [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2187.46s)]
*  But video obtained by the new york times from one of the deceased paramedics phones [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2192.98s)]
*  Very clearly shows the ambulance is lit up. They have lights and sirens [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2198.34s)]
*  Uh, the the idf has since tried to walk back part of its story [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2202.98s)]
*  They said the incident is under investigation but like look longtime observers of [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2206.26s)]
*  Idf statements should not be remotely surprised that they lied so brazenly about this incident [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2210.42s)]
*  Uh, and this is just it's another horrific war crime. Yeah [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2215.94s)]
*  uh [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2220.18s)]
*  There's no other way to describe it. It's a war crime and the only thing i'd add to this is [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2221.22s)]
*  this [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2227.14s)]
*  The brazenness of how they lie about it and then say they're going to do an investigation and let's i'm just going to roll back [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2228.3399999999997s)]
*  The tape this is what just drove me crazy about tony blinken and the biden officials [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2234.2599999999998s)]
*  Every time something like this would happen. They'd say there's an israeli investigation [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2238.9s)]
*  And they get pressed at their briefings and say well the israelis have the capacity to investigate the israelis never [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2242.34s)]
*  Nobody's ever held accountable. It's a joke, you know, and and this just proves what a what an absolute farce [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2247.7000000000003s)]
*  It is to think that anything that they're saying about these so-called investigations can be trusted same with the the killing of shireen abu akhla [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2254.5s)]
*  Who's a the palestinian-american journalist who was shot by an idf soldier if you enable that kind of behavior over time [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2261.54s)]
*  You get this kind of outcome and it's why? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2268.42s)]
*  The icc gets involved because if you can't trust the governing authority to actually hold itself accountable [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2271.54s)]
*  Exactly, that's why there's international justice. That's right [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2278.02s)]
*  But so the big news out of this oval office meeting between nanyahu and trump [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2280.58s)]
*  Was trump just announcing that the u.s is going to have direct talks with iran this weekend about its nuclear program [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2285.14s)]
*  Uh, it turns out I think they're indirect talks once the details came out, but the talks are going to take place in oman [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2291.94s)]
*  um iran's foreign minister [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2297.3s)]
*  Said he's going to be their representative and then actual secretary of state steve witkoff is going to be the rep from noted [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2300.2599999999998s)]
*  Wrong expert noted [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2306.98s)]
*  So nanyahu, I don't know nanyahu in the meeting was saying he wants a deal along the lines of what happened in libya when they [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2310.02s)]
*  denuclearized basically that was them [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2317.68s)]
*  Like putting all their gear into boxes shipping out of the country like fully getting rid of everything back in 2003 [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2320.8199999999997s)]
*  Here's how trump himself though talked about these talks everybody agrees that [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2327.0600000000004s)]
*  Doing a deal would be preferable [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2332.5800000000004s)]
*  to doing the obvious [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2335.6200000000003s)]
*  And the obvious is not something that I want to be involved with or frankly that israel wants to be involved with if they can avoid it [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2337.5400000000004s)]
*  So we're going to see if we can avoid it if diplomacy fails [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2345.3s)]
*  Is the united states under your leadership ready to take military action to destroy the iranian nuclear program? [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2348.9s)]
*  Program and remove this threat [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2355.54s)]
*  I think if the talks aren't successful with iran [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2359.22s)]
*  I think iran is going to be in great danger and I hate to say it great danger because they can't have a nuclear weapon [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2363.78s)]
*  You know, it's not a complicated [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2370.9s)]
*  Formula iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. That's all there is can't have it [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2373.68s)]
*  If you're going to negotiate a new deal in iran with iran [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2378.26s)]
*  Can you elaborate how it's going to be more effective than the than the jcpoa? [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2380.82s)]
*  Well, I can't really say that but I think it'll be different and maybe a lot stronger [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2385.46s)]
*  so [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2391.54s)]
*  I don't know that I mean, I think bb floating the libya comparison is interesting because I think [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2393.2200000000003s)]
*  People probably realize that's way too hard line of an approach and I think actually a smart iran [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2401.1400000000003s)]
*  Observer reminded me that back in 2020 trump accused john bolton of poisoning the well and talks with the north koreans [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2406.5s)]
*  By bringing up the libya model, which is interesting. I wonder if bb was aware of that [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2413.22s)]
*  But then I was just thinking back to the jcpoa like these are [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2417.54s)]
*  highly technical [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2421.22s)]
*  conversations about like amounts of low enriched in uranium and centrifuges and inspections and heavy water [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2423.28s)]
*  plutonium limits and the arms embargoes and all the shit like [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2431.52s)]
*  Steve witkoff doesn't know fuck all about any of that. Like maybe he'll be [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2435.62s)]
*  You have some, you know state department experts in tell no because they fired most of those people [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2440.18s)]
*  I don't know. Maybe this is just [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2445.54s)]
*  Talks designed to kind of like feel out the willingness of both sides to make a deal [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2447.78s)]
*  But I don't know you like have to have some knowledge of the details [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2453.14s)]
*  Yeah, i've tried to not have extreme ptsd from this whole thing. Um [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2456.66s)]
*  Um, but i'll indulge my own ptsd from working for seven fucking years on the iran deal that trump tore up [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2462.4199999999996s)]
*  Our talks with the iranians began you'll remember [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2471.94s)]
*  Exactly this way so the reports are that witkoff is going to oman [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2475.94s)]
*  And they're going to meet and kind of meet indirectly in oman with oman. He's hosting both parties and kind of passing messages back and forth [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2479.7s)]
*  That's where we were. I know in [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2486.1s)]
*  2013 it was jake in the stash jake solvitt and bill burns [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2488.96s)]
*  and [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2492.42s)]
*  We after four years of negotiation and fighting with congress got this deal done that trump tore up and so [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2493.54s)]
*  What was the point of this whole thing? [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2500.82s)]
*  What was the point of this whole exercise in tearing up the iran deal just to stick it to the black president that you didn't like? [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2502.9s)]
*  Because he's more popular than you [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2510.5s)]
*  so that you could be sitting in the oval office in [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2512.7400000000002s)]
*  20 20 what years [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2516.1600000000003s)]
*  Five 20 10 years after the iran deal was signed [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2518.64s)]
*  A decade run it back a decade after the iran deal was signed. We're rolling the tape all the way back to 2013 [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2523.2799999999997s)]
*  They're making a naked gun movie. I'm so apoplectic that I don't remember what fucking year it is [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2529.12s)]
*  Like this is insane to me that we're having this conversation about iran deal in the office [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2534.0s)]
*  He doesn't even know what was in the jcpa. He doesn't even know what the jcpa is [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2539.68s)]
*  He doesn't know what that acronym stands for right? [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2544.0s)]
*  And and so here we are and and and you got bb flowing libya option to kill the deal [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2546.3999999999996s)]
*  That's exactly bb is many things [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2552.3999999999996s)]
*  He's not dumb and the reason that that killed the north korean deal is everybody knows [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2554.16s)]
*  That kaddafi gave up his nuclear weapons and where did he end up fucking with a bullet in his head in a drain pipe? [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2558.72s)]
*  Okay, and that's what the supreme leader does [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2563.92s)]
*  So, okay, that's off my chest. I mean, I think the thing to watch here substantively is [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2567.8399999999997s)]
*  Is will the iranians, you know come out with their hands up and you know, maybe i'll be proven wrong [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2574.0s)]
*  They'll give up every bolt and screw their nuclear program [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2580.4s)]
*  If it's anything like the iranians that that the world has dealt with [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2583.6000000000004s)]
*  They'll you know drag this out and they'll try to keep pieces of their nuclear infrastructure and make concessions over here for trades over there [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2587.28s)]
*  They want sanctions relief over here. And you know, I just [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2593.76s)]
*  Their capacity if they can't just steamroll them because the iranians are weaker [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2598.32s)]
*  They can't just kind of steamroll them [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2603.76s)]
*  um, I I just I i see them probably coming out with something that [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2605.92s)]
*  might look quite like the jcpoa that they declare is stronger if if they do get a deal and and [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2611.1200000000003s)]
*  What did we all just spend 10 years of our lives on? I don't know. I mean, yeah the context is [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2617.84s)]
*  similar but different a lot of ways I mean [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2622.96s)]
*  the context around the jcpoa was years and years and years of crushing us and [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2625.1200000000003s)]
*  Multilateral sanctions that were designed to pressure the iranians to come to the table to have these talks, right now [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2629.92s)]
*  Iran is so much closer to getting a nuclear weapon than they ever were then so that's riskier. However, their proxies in [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2636.96s)]
*  Hezbollah have been decimated [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2644.48s)]
*  um, I don't know that that's you make an important point though [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2646.64s)]
*  They're much closer to a nuclear weapon today than they were even when we send the jcpoa [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2649.76s)]
*  um, and so that's the urgency here and you know, he's pretty like blunt about the [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2653.84s)]
*  Military threat the one thing I just added on the table tome here is that there's this trip that I think trump has planned [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2659.2799999999997s)]
*  To saudi his first foreign trip is to saudi. Yeah and israel, I think [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2665.6s)]
*  Watch that space, uh, because it wouldn't shock me [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2670.32s)]
*  You know trump likes to do things fast and he likes big announcements [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2674.16s)]
*  And and they may try and the saudis have been getting tight with the iranians like there's been not tight [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2677.12s)]
*  But they've been they've restored relations. They they they they talk to each other [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2681.92s)]
*  Mbs has talked to the iranians. It wouldn't surprise me if the saudis try to use that trip [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2686.9599999999996s)]
*  um [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2692.3199999999997s)]
*  to [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2693.2799999999997s)]
*  Stage some meeting [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2694.3199999999997s)]
*  Um with trump and the iranians you'd love that or some he'd love that because he likes to make history, you know [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2696.72s)]
*  Um or some announcement of a deal that maybe isn't fully negotiated [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2702.56s)]
*  So that's that's the wild card here is that that that trip I I bet that's what wikoff's assignment is [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2707.2s)]
*  Yeah, and if if look if the iranians are smart and they can just put down the bullshit in the bluster [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2712.32s)]
*  They will make up some nonsensical story [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2718.4s)]
*  About how they all went to the mosque to pray for trump after he was shot in butler [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2721.6000000000004s)]
*  And commissioned some fucking like to give wikoff a portrait oil painting [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2726.96s)]
*  Yeah, I gotta get a rug made with trump's face on it with a bunch of gold leaf [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2730.8s)]
*  You know what I mean load up wikoff's plane with some barrels of oil [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2735.04s)]
*  Buy some trump coin. Well, that's the thing. They they probably would like the funny thing is they'll probably offer all this oil [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2739.3599999999997s)]
*  Which we we never could have accepted because we'd be violating our intentions trump be like I got the oil. Yeah, you know, oh listen [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2744.96s)]
*  By the way, can you imagine how much uh? [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2751.7599999999998s)]
*  How many of these uh tariff deals are going to be sorted out via trump coin transactions? Oh, yeah [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2754.08s)]
*  Yeah, a little meme coin. Yeah, something to look forward to [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2758.64s)]
*  All right, then let's change gears here. So we've talked a lot about the civil war in sudan over the last two years [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2761.52s)]
*  We've not dug into the situation in south sudan [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2765.84s)]
*  Recently, so we did want to cover that today because there's some real concern that it could tip into a civil war there, too [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2769.1200000000003s)]
*  So just some background that'll try to be quick about south sudan gained its independence in 2011 [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2774.56s)]
*  This came after decades and decades of civil war that finally ended after the sudanese government and the sudan people's liberation movement or splm [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2779.1200000000003s)]
*  signed a peace agreement in 2005 called the comprehensive peace agreement, uh the comprehensive peace agreement or cpa [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2786.88s)]
*  Set forward this process that ultimately led to a near unanimous vote for independence in south sudan in 2011 [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2793.44s)]
*  But unfortunately soon after south sudan's independence the country fell into civil war that killed literally hundreds of thousands of people [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2801.52s)]
*  In 2018 mediators finally got both sides to agree to a power-sharing structure to stop the fighting and calm [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2809.2s)]
*  Ethnic tensions between the two main ethnic groups in sudan the dinka and the newer [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2817.6s)]
*  Uh, but that was sort of a temporary fix salvakir who represented the dinka became president rayak machar [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2822.2400000000002s)]
*  Who represented the newer became the vice president? [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2828.48s)]
*  This deal was also included a bunch of other steps that got it to a more like durable piece that I will not [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2831.6000000000004s)]
*  Outline for you guys because none of them got implemented [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2837.5200000000004s)]
*  um, but over the years, uh, [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2840.0800000000004s)]
*  The sudan south sudan's government and power-sharing structure was basically held together by patronage from oil revenue [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2842.96s)]
*  That was sort of papering over these ethnic rivalries [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2850.2400000000002s)]
*  but uh, here's where the the [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2853.28s)]
*  Challenge comes south sudan is really dependent on these oil pipelines that flow through sudan itself [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2856.2400000000002s)]
*  And because of the civil war in sudan one of those pipelines became inoperable [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2861.12s)]
*  In south sudan's oil exports and revenue were cut off for about a year cutting off that source of patronage money that could kind of [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2865.28s)]
*  Keep the lid on things further complicating things is the fact that the oil pipelines go through territory held by both sides [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2871.76s)]
*  Of the civil war in sudan, so it led to complicated politics [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2877.3599999999997s)]
*  So in the last few months salvakir the president has started firing ministers close to machar the vice president [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2880.4s)]
*  That violated this power sharing agreement and then in late march machar himself was arrested and put under house arrest [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2886.56s)]
*  Meanwhile these militia groups that seem to have political ties have been attacking civilians government troops even u.n forces [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2892.64s)]
*  So ben in previous administrations [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2899.6s)]
*  The international community would probably look to the united states to try to help mediate the conflict [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2902.3199999999997s)]
*  Prevent it from spilling out into a civil war prevent something even worse from happening [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2906.88s)]
*  But what did state department jr help desk technician marco rubio announced over the weekend that he was revoking visas for south sudanese [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2910.7999999999997s)]
*  Nationals and barring any south sudanese citizens from entering the u.s. The south sudan is apparently not accepting repatriation flights fast enough [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2918.06s)]
*  Uh, so then I was talking to some like south sudan experts today. I try to get my handle on this they all [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2926.08s)]
*  We got into a bunch of the details but big picture one of them said to me [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2932.88s)]
*  This is basically the final act of a failed state [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2936.64s)]
*  Yeah [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2939.68s)]
*  In a state building project that began in 2005 during the bush administration when the u.s was at its height the height of its nation building [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2939.84s)]
*  Frenzy [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2946.22s)]
*  And it really has been deeply troubled ever since I mean even in 2011 after the referendum vote [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2947.36s)]
*  A lot of people saw the writing on the wall here and the really hard part is there's just no clear sense [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2952.72s)]
*  Of what if anything the international community can do to kind of help or reverse the trend line and it was just very [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2958.56s)]
*  sobering conversations [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2966.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2968.56s)]
*  You know we had [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2970.48s)]
*  the precipice of civil war [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2972.0s)]
*  Between the same two guys [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2974.0s)]
*  Salva kira mishar in the second obama administration and it took a lot of effort [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2975.7599999999998s)]
*  To kind of get them to climb down and come up with some power sharing formula that they continually push against violate [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2980.3199999999997s)]
*  And the reality is that the country's never really had it was born without any institutions without any infrastructure to so to speak [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2986.96s)]
*  The leadership the political leadership salva cure. I remember talking to someone who went to deliver a message to him once and he was [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=2994.0s)]
*  Had a strong smell of alcohol and he yelled at the person about how he's fought in the bush his whole life [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3001.6s)]
*  He's not going to surrender right? [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3006.64s)]
*  and and and and and and and you know [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3009.68s)]
*  it's a [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3013.52s)]
*  It's tragic for the people of south sudan that they are kind of trapped under these leaders who just revert to [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3014.96s)]
*  Patronage tribalism and violence to kind of maintain their zero sum politics and do nothing to kind of build up the country [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3022.0s)]
*  And I think so, where does this go? [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3029.68s)]
*  you're right in normal old times those good old days that you know weren't that great, but [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3032.96s)]
*  the un the us [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3038.72s)]
*  Would get involved with a group of with the african union and a group of regional countries [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3040.64s)]
*  And try to negotiate something and try to have experts on the ground and try to have some kind of peacekeeping capacity [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3045.7599999999998s)]
*  And and stabilizing there is no functioning capacity for the un to do that with the us so out to lunch, you know [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3052.16s)]
*  And trade wars going on and a civil war in sudan just to the north [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3060.0s)]
*  And and so what I think is interesting to watch here [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3064.96s)]
*  Is it just is going to push it further and further like even in the obama years like I remember we relied a lot on kenya [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3067.7599999999998s)]
*  And ethiopia and uganda and the kind of you know [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3073.92s)]
*  regional powers [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3077.36s)]
*  That had influence into these different parties to kind of lean on people and and to kind of arm twist and to do whatever [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3078.8s)]
*  Diplomatic formulas they could work out. I think what we're going to see is the kind of increasing [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3086.0s)]
*  Regional and by the way, those are the countries that are bearing the burden of hosting refugees [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3090.24s)]
*  So this is a real issue for them because they already have huge amounts of refugees in places at kenya [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3093.6s)]
*  so I think the burden is just going to push further and further on to [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3099.28s)]
*  Regional organizations like the african union and regional powers like that [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3102.8799999999997s)]
*  We have no answer to this other than our immigration policy like we have no formula for it, right? [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3106.3999999999996s)]
*  and so I think that that just pushes it it's just going to be left on the laps of [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3110.7999999999997s)]
*  uh of the regional parties to deal with it and in adding to your [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3116.0s)]
*  Your point about like leaning on these regional actors [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3120.3999999999996s)]
*  I think into the phrase entered another one that we've talked about in the sudan context, which is the uae [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3123.4399999999996s)]
*  And they are funding one side of the civil war they're funding the rsf [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3128.48s)]
*  But also I think [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3132.1600000000003s)]
*  uae turned to south sudan and some of these tribal militias [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3134.48s)]
*  to get fighters [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3138.0s)]
*  For their project in yemen for years and years and years and they built these ties to salvage here [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3140.2400000000002s)]
*  And it sounds like the the guy that kyr is named to be a successor is sort of like seen as [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3144.96s)]
*  the uae's guy and kind of a money guy with the [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3149.6800000000003s)]
*  With no real political or military experience or clear ties to the splm [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3153.12s)]
*  But he has these clear ties to the uae that I think are making people wonder about that. It just sudan has just [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3157.44s)]
*  Gotten a raw deal sudan and south sudan. It's just this playground for these [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3164.4s)]
*  External parties and and these ambitions by the way the u.s [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3168.64s)]
*  Right. I mean we were going to I mean bush got very involved in this because it's christian part [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3172.16s)]
*  You know south sudan is a christian part of what used to be sudan [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3177.44s)]
*  And there's we're going to state building in the obama years [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3181.04s)]
*  We got all excited about the newly independent country of south sudan and we kind of projected this [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3183.84s)]
*  Like savior complex. Let's be honest about it onto this place where we had no capacity to to build something [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3190.4s)]
*  Yeah, and and you know, there's the real question of like [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3198.2400000000002s)]
*  once the international community [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3201.6800000000003s)]
*  Uh creates a failed state. What do you do with it? [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3204.32s)]
*  What happens now? [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3208.48s)]
*  What should happen is like basically a receivership right that the un [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3210.56s)]
*  I mean there have been times like in central africa republic where they're with borderline un governance essentially [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3214.2400000000002s)]
*  But the you that requires kind of the security council to be able to get together and put that together and i'm just not optimistic [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3220.88s)]
*  No that the u.s russian china could agree to some receivership for south sudan. Yeah, I think that's uh, a huge peacekeeping force [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3227.36s)]
*  Yeah, and there's some speculation that salvag here the president is dying and again, he's trying to anoint the successor [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3234.4s)]
*  I mean these guys have been around for a while. They've been around for a long time and and kira mashara [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3240.48s)]
*  They someone was telling me they barely have armies at this point [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3244.0s)]
*  They're all sort of like linked militias [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3246.88s)]
*  but I was talking to alan boswell who's a crisis group expert on africa generally and he was just saying that like [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3248.6400000000003s)]
*  regionally [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3254.54s)]
*  The pressures that are leading to fragmentation are so much stronger than the pressures that would normally consolidate countries [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3255.6800000000003s)]
*  And there just doesn't seem to be any force. That's a smart kind of bringing them back together [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3262.7200000000003s)]
*  That's a really good point [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3266.4s)]
*  Well, because and this is again what the [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3267.76s)]
*  What the un is supposed to fill that gap and we're but the un can't it's not their fault that you have a dysfunctional [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3270.88s)]
*  Yeah, security council because they can't do it. It was hard enough when you had things working well in like the 90s [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3278.0800000000004s)]
*  Uh now it's seemingly impossible. It's impossible. Uh, speaking of political dysfunction, let's turn to south korea then so [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3284.2400000000002s)]
*  Uh, we talked in the show a bunch about uh, south korean president yoon suk yool's political drama and career [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3290.1600000000003s)]
*  It's finally coming to a close four months after he invoked martial law the country's constitutional court has finally ruled that yoon should be removed [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3295.6000000000004s)]
*  In south korea's interim president has announced a snap election on june 3rd. So a quick rewind on how this all played out [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3303.2000000000003s)]
*  Last year on december 3rd yoon shocked everyone by declaring martial law [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3310.0s)]
*  He claimed at the time that these anti-state forces were a threat to the country in north korea blah blah blah [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3313.6000000000004s)]
*  And then sent troops into the parliament in what was clearly a coup attempt. That was obviously [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3318.6400000000003s)]
*  Uh bullshit in a pretext the reality was unit effectively been politically neutered because the democratic opposition [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3324.16s)]
*  Had taken control of the national assembly and they were not only trying to impeach a lot of his cabinet members [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3331.04s)]
*  But also slash his government's budget so the martial law decree created chaos [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3335.6800000000003s)]
*  But that chaos only lasted a few hours [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3340.96s)]
*  Thanks to really brave protesters who took to the streets and then members of the national assembly who rushed down [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3342.64s)]
*  To the national assembly and and voted to lift the the martial law declaration by about 4 30 the next morning [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3349.04s)]
*  since then though [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3356.16s)]
*  The drama has not stopped so yoon was impeached on december 14th on december 31st south korea issued a warrant for his arrest [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3357.6s)]
*  He refused to come in for questioning over and over again. There was this six-hour standoff. It got crazy [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3363.44s)]
*  um, and now but now uh, yoon has finally been removed from office he still has to deal with [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3368.16s)]
*  Criminal charges a criminal trial that starts on april 14th that includes the charge of insurrection that could get him life in prison [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3374.8s)]
*  Or even the death penalty. So this election that's coming up, uh, will likely [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3381.6000000000004s)]
*  Put the opposition in power. Uh, ej. Myeong is the leader of the opposition democratic party. He's the current front runner [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3386.88s)]
*  He has dealt with his own legal challenges in the past, but more interesting then is how much he differs on policy [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3393.76s)]
*  So I was talking to our buddy danny russell, uh earlier today [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3399.36s)]
*  He was a top asia hand in the obama administration [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3402.4s)]
*  He's now the vice president for international security and diplomacy at the asia society policy institute [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3405.36s)]
*  And danny was saying that if you know if myeong wins trump is going to have a partner in south korea [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3410.32s)]
*  Who is far more accommodationist with north korea, which I don't know that could cut both ways with trump [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3415.68s)]
*  Like he he loves, you know kim jong-un [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3421.2s)]
*  But also is probably going to be far more willing to work with the chinese and resistant to u.s [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3423.68s)]
*  In treaties to be hardline against china [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3428.88s)]
*  So a huge change from the context that biden was working with with eun where you had, you know hardline on [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3432.56s)]
*  north korea the willingness to you know [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3439.92s)]
*  Uh men fences with the japanese and have these trilateral meetings, etc. So ben [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3443.76s)]
*  Thoughts on the saga and just like what things could look like going forward, uh between the u.s and south korea [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3449.36s)]
*  Yeah [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3455.84s)]
*  Quite a saga, um with everything going on in the world this you know didn't get quite the attention might have otherwise gotten [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3457.04s)]
*  I think one of the things I learned throughout the saga tommy is like, okay on the one hand [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3462.56s)]
*  The the institutions of south korean democracy kind of held right like they they [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3467.1200000000003s)]
*  Resisted the martial law declaration the kind of coup attempt and they ran through a process that ultimately removed a guy that [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3471.42s)]
*  You know, i'm not a legal expert on south korean, uh legal [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3478.32s)]
*  Legalese but pretty clearly there's pretty good grounds to to believe this guy for sure what I don't fully understand [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3482.88s)]
*  I have to acknowledge is the kind of depth of these cleavages in south korean society that were so on display [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3489.52s)]
*  There's there's always been a kind of left right divide [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3495.52s)]
*  generational divides divides about the feelings about the military dictatorship [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3498.62s)]
*  Divides about feelings about the u.s presence, right? So all these things enter into this left right divide [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3503.44s)]
*  And and I don't think you heal that just with booting this guy and having an election [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3509.76s)]
*  You've had now, you know two consecutive conservative presidents, uh get impeached [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3514.4s)]
*  Now this guy for pretty good reason and then I think three consecutive [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3520.48s)]
*  Ones at least going to prison, you know [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3524.32s)]
*  So the the stakes, you know, they're playing high table stakes in south korean politics for the u.s piece of it [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3527.44s)]
*  What's interesting is as creepy as some of these more conservative leaders have been [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3532.8s)]
*  They generally work better with the u.s because they're generally hawkish on north korea. They're generally supportive of the u.s alliance [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3538.32s)]
*  um, and and and so if it swings to the left [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3544.0s)]
*  I think that the combination of trump, I mean you teed this up, but the combination of trump and [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3547.76s)]
*  tariff dynamic and this change [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3553.7400000000002s)]
*  We should expect a south korea that is getting much closer to china and and starting to see that maybe [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3556.48s)]
*  Its long-term kind of economic security if not its security [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3561.76s)]
*  Is going to have to depend not just on the united states but on china as well [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3565.44s)]
*  And that raises questions about like the u.s troop presence long term and certainly alignment with u.s diplomatic priorities. So [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3568.56s)]
*  You know that may be fine with trump [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3575.2s)]
*  But we could start to see this [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3578.16s)]
*  really intense network in the same way that nato is fraying that kind of network of [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3580.24s)]
*  asian alliances fraying as well, yeah, I mean on the tariff point you just made I mean the [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3585.2799999999997s)]
*  South koreans like the japanese made huge commercial investments in the u.s building factories and production plants and now they're like hey [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3590.7200000000003s)]
*  Mr. President like you're still going to tariff the shit out of us like but trump only cares that they did it under biden [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3599.6s)]
*  So it doesn't count and they have a free trade agreement [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3604.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it's one of the things that's kind of missing in this is we're terrifying all these countries that we have [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3607.6800000000003s)]
*  Free trade agreements ratified through our congress with yeah, I mean [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3612.4s)]
*  Bind it like for decades like it's crazy. It's just like what's the point of an agreement? [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3616.08s)]
*  It's just words on paper. Yeah, and by the way people used to say that us after the obama administration [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3620.96s)]
*  I used to get this line of criticism when trump tore up the iran deal and the cuba opening [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3626.08s)]
*  Well, you guys should have pushed that through congress then he wouldn't have been able to do it [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3630.32s)]
*  He's tearing up stuff that is ratified treaties treaties ratified through congress. Yeah free free trade agreements ratified through congress by declaration [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3633.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah, someone was talking to me at a similar point to me about [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3641.1200000000003s)]
*  like [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3645.76s)]
*  You know, we will the south korea will remove this [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3646.8s)]
*  Chapter of their political saga [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3650.0s)]
*  But the population kind of went from like a third left a third moderate to a third right wing to like 50 50s [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3651.6800000000003s)]
*  Polarized polarized like us and they're also there's this weird growing divide in south korea between men and women [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3658.7000000000003s)]
*  There was a 2019 poll found 70 percent of korean men in their 20s think the problem of discrimination against men is a serious one [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3665.28s)]
*  That's a lot of that stems from mandatory military service for men [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3672.08s)]
*  But uh, there was a 2021 ipso's fold that found polarization among men and women in their 20s and 30s is the most severe [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3676.56s)]
*  In south korea and women are increasingly identifying as liberal and men are conservative in president yoon sounds a little familiar [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3683.6s)]
*  Yeah, president yoon ran like similar kind of reactionary getting rid of like did he go on joe rogan? [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3690.08s)]
*  Basically, yeah sort of like ran on some of this up. I do think you alluded something [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3696.56s)]
*  I think it's really important which is um, is trump going to want to withdraw troops? [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3700.96s)]
*  from the korean peninsula and you're starting to see polling where like [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3705.76s)]
*  Two-thirds of south koreans are [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3709.44s)]
*  You know supportive of getting their own nuclear weapon. I mean if the u.s pulls out [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3712.16s)]
*  This like if uh, if a more lefty administration comes in that will likely blunt that [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3717.76s)]
*  Popular sentiment, I don't think they're going to want to develop a nuke but um if we leave [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3723.68s)]
*  Yeah, and it was always like the older generations were more supportive of the u.s [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3728.32s)]
*  Presence because they remembered the aftermath of the korean war and the u.s kind of feeling like it saved their country in some ways [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3732.1600000000003s)]
*  So that could all be dissipating. We're just we're moving out of this era, you know the era defined by [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3739.84s)]
*  The all these post-war post-cold war institutions and relationships and this is a big part of that [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3746.56s)]
*  By the way, just one light point. Do you remember? [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3752.2400000000002s)]
*  Um [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3754.64s)]
*  Before trump even years before donald trump when we were in korea and we're trying to negotiate the chorus agreement [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3755.84s)]
*  And I know you remember this is what i'm doing this up [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3761.44s)]
*  uh that I I won't name the reporter but [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3763.84s)]
*  Barack obama was doing a jordan press conference with uh, the president of south korea [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3766.7200000000003s)]
*  Lee mumbach and this reporter stands up and starts screaming at the president of south korea that why [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3771.44s)]
*  Americans who fought and died for his country like you should have to pay more for like hondas or something [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3776.48s)]
*  Yes [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3782.1600000000003s)]
*  I was so embarrassed. I thought a whole trip. That was one of the worst trips i've ever done because we got [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3783.12s)]
*  We got it [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3788.16s)]
*  They they stiffed us on I forget where we were before that [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3789.44s)]
*  It was one of those 10 day trips to asia where you just never sleep the entire time [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3792.4s)]
*  We were in india before that and then we didn't get the free trade agreement finalized [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3795.52s)]
*  then uh a reporter from the new york times [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3801.44s)]
*  Lectured the south korean president about how people died and shouldn't have to buy hondas or something and then [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3804.16s)]
*  we got [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3810.88s)]

*  So we found some stupid shit that brought us joy first at a recent event at winter cassadil king charles blew a carrot [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3849.7599999999998s)]
*  A carrot that had been carved into a recorder gifted to him by the london vegetable orchestra, which according to their website is a real thing [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3855.6s)]
*  And two features a mouthwatering selection of courgettes peppers potatoes swedes and butternut squash accompanying a soaring lineup of carrot recorders [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3862.32s)]

*  Or at least clothing pins on their nose because president ammanuel macron has taken to um a certain style [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=3926.88s)]

*  the other really important part to understand is that [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4533.62s)]
*  Our organization has documented systematic practices of torture [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4538.099999999999s)]
*  Right, so when people enter the prisons, it's common that the guards will say to them. You won't leave here walking [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4542.34s)]
*  There'll be [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4549.86s)]
*  Sort of induction beatings you see a little of that aggression in the videos of the venezuelans [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4550.98s)]
*  But in the other prisons with salvadoran prisoners captured in the state of exception. It's systematic [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4556.419999999999s)]
*  Just last week [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4563.139999999999s)]
*  Our forensic investigators were in the field [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4564.9s)]
*  Verifying the death of a 24 year old man [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4568.58s)]
*  He apparently died of kidney failure [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4572.5s)]
*  We were able to do a forensic assessment of the body [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4575.7s)]
*  24 year old men don't usually die of kidney failure topic [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4578.58s)]
*  Much less than a question of months [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4582.900000000001s)]
*  Those are usually deaths that are caused by two things in the prisons [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4585.700000000001s)]
*  One is the systematic denial of access to water and a bathroom [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4589.46s)]
*  That causes kidneys to fail [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4594.42s)]
*  Or beatings that destroy their internal organs [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4596.42s)]
*  We see that also we have cases of people who have died of starvation because their stomachs were destroyed by beatings [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4599.860000000001s)]
*  So i'm this is the panorama. This is the context [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4606.259999999999s)]
*  of the [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4611.139999999999s)]
*  penitentiary system [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4612.4s)]
*  That president trump or bukele offered to president trump [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4614.0199999999995s)]
*  But I should make like one caveat here [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4617.7s)]
*  It is really important for listeners to understand [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4620.259999999999s)]
*  And the maximum security prisons were the overwhelming majority of the people captured in the state of exception [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4623.54s)]
*  The 85 000 are being held are the older maximum security prisons [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4630.42s)]
*  The secot that was built during the state of exception [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4635.06s)]
*  It is where as far as we can tell [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4638.34s)]
*  Older gang members who were already in prison serving sentences prior to the state of exception were transferred there [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4642.34s)]
*  And you can see that because the image of these people are fully tattooed faces [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4649.3s)]
*  You see the names of the gangs on their chests and on their faces. That's a practice that gangs haven't been doing for like 15 years [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4653.78s)]
*  and so [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4660.66s)]
*  The reason I bring that up is because the secot has become [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4662.74s)]
*  The terrorist confinement center we call it the secot has become sort of the public face of the bukele security model [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4666.58s)]
*  It's the branding and they do that intentionally to show these images of gang members that are somewhat terrifying looking [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4672.5s)]
*  But they are in these videos and photos dehumanized [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4681.22s)]
*  And the optics of it [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4685.9400000000005s)]
*  Tells you the message which is these are monsters. These are people who are enemies of society [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4688.099999999999s)]
*  And this is how strong men deal with the worst of the worst [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4694.9s)]
*  That's the narrative that they convey through the the optics of it [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4698.66s)]
*  But it's the actual people in asado who have been detained [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4702.0199999999995s)]
*  In our research in a sample of like a thousand two hundred only fifty four even had tattoos and only nine of those were gang members [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4705.7s)]
*  The people being detained are poor [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4712.66s)]
*  Their their farmers their informal sales people their their constructions workers day laborers even like pregnant women [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4714.74s)]
*  Um, so I guess it's important to make that distinction the conditions that you see on the videos of secot show [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4722.66s)]
*  a modern looking [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4730.58s)]
*  facility [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4733.44s)]
*  whose architecture and design is [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4734.82s)]
*  built for cruelty [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4738.58s)]
*  There are no doubt that they celebrate even in those videos certain practices that are analogous to torture [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4740.5s)]
*  Yeah, sadly those conditions might be better than the conditions that the 85 000 are being held in and other maximum security prisons [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4745.78s)]
*  Yeah, and I should just say I was talking yesterday to uh a lawyer [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4753.22s)]
*  Who works at an organization that is coordinating across a lot of the lawyers who are representing some of the venezuelan men [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4758.18s)]
*  Who have been rendered from the u.s to el salvador? [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4764.34s)]
*  And they've had no contacts their families had no contacts with any of these individuals since they left the country [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4768.44s)]
*  Um most of the information that these lawyers know or their families know about [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4775.16s)]
*  Where these men are are because bukele is this super online like millennial dictator? [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4780.28s)]
*  Who had not only his own kind of like internal [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4786.36s)]
*  camera crews [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4789.8s)]
*  Filming these like hype videos where we see some of the torture like techniques you're talking about [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4791.32s)]
*  I mean these men are being at a bare minimum roughed up, but then there are these [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4796.6s)]
*  situations they put them in where they essentially like [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4801.240000000001s)]
*  Get them down on their knees and and shove their faces into the ground and stack them together like [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4804.200000000001s)]
*  the the the [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4809.64s)]
*  Inhumanity and brutality [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4811.700000000001s)]
*  Um is on display and very much by design as you said, um, but but bukele, you know, he's been president since 2019 [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4813.400000000001s)]
*  Um, his shtick is he thinks he's a cool dictator [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4820.4400000000005s)]
*  He launched this aggressive crackdown on gangs he locked up 85 000 people as you said [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4823.8s)]
*  He was reelected last year [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4829.0s)]
*  um in this landslide victory, although you guys have [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4831.32s)]
*  Documented, you know a lot of context for that victory that I think would be worth you getting into can you explain? [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4836.26s)]
*  to listeners though how this [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4841.8s)]
*  Sweeping mass incarceration policy that you just described is at the root of his [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4843.96s)]
*  Political strength essentially I I don't I would say I would start with um [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4850.2s)]
*  This idea that's consistent in El Salvador and I think around the world that the [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4856.280000000001s)]
*  punitive populist brand of politics [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4863.62s)]
*  Is very effective in election cycles [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4867.56s)]
*  And very few politicians can tell societies that are being affected by [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4870.04s)]
*  you know [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4875.4800000000005s)]
*  indiscriminate violence [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4876.5s)]
*  That they're going to defend rule of law and due process [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4878.2s)]
*  And win against the candidate that's saying i'm going to do whatever it takes to destroy [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4882.84s)]
*  these enemies and so [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4887.8s)]
*  the idea of [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4890.84s)]
*  Punitive populism is a seductive political strategy that's worked for bukele, but it's worked [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4893.32s)]
*  Consistently everywhere everywhere and actually one of the things that most concerns me when I listen to the discourse in the united states right now [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4899.38s)]
*  is [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4907.160000000001s)]
*  how [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4908.360000000001s)]
*  Is i'm hearing the discourse of security in exchange for rights [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4909.320000000001s)]
*  this idea [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4914.52s)]
*  And the only way to deal with this emergency and to eliminate the enemies that are affecting our society [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4916.040000000001s)]
*  is to [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4923.72s)]
*  Suspend rights and to hype the threat right like so like no one had heard of trende aragua [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4925.160000000001s)]
*  Two or three years ago now that you know fox news the trump administration [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4930.040000000001s)]
*  They're trying to put them on on par with like al qaeda in 2002 right and and to be honest democrats like the little d ones [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4933.48s)]
*  People who believe in democracy as a superior form of governance need to figure out how to address the security narrative [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4941.08s)]
*  It's a very challenging one. There's a lot of pitfalls [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4947.959999999999s)]
*  We begin to talk about defending institutions against like threats real or perceived or perceived [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4950.599999999999s)]
*  And we look like we're defending the status quo [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4957.799999999999s)]
*  Uh against a reformer who's going to finally fix the problem, right? So it's a it's a narrative that's known [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4960.92s)]
*  It's a it's a dangerous one [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4967.5599999999995s)]
*  That really opens the pathway to consolidate expanding to executive power [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4969.8s)]
*  uh in in [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4974.84s)]
*  Consolidating authoritarian control. So just that piece of it but going back more specifically to your question [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4976.98s)]
*  Our organization [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4984.759999999999s)]
*  Has spent the last 15 years assisting families fleeing gang violence narco trafficking violence in central america [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4987.0s)]
*  And all of us who live in a central america all of us who live in osaburo [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4995.320000000001s)]
*  Have lived under the terror of the gangs. We've seen the atrocities [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=4999.56s)]
*  It's a society [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5004.92s)]
*  That after the signing of the peace accords into 1992 [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5007.320000000001s)]
*  Uh [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5011.74s)]
*  Had incipient hopes of becoming a democracy but very quickly [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5013.26s)]
*  mass migration [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5018.7s)]
*  corruption gang violence [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5020.46s)]
*  Creates a sense of sort of collective humiliation [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5023.1s)]
*  and so the Salvadoran people's [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5026.38s)]
*  Support of president bukele [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5029.8s)]
*  Is very similar to other authoritarian sort of [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5032.780000000001s)]
*  psychological emotional connections that leaders build with [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5036.360000000001s)]
*  Populations who have suffered collective humiliations [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5039.88s)]
*  He promises a better future. He promises a new idea of a country [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5043.18s)]
*  And that becomes very seductive to people especially people in the diaspora in the united states, right? [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5048.46s)]
*  and so [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5054.46s)]
*  with the narrative [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5056.14s)]
*  Of having like the day one when bukele comes to office they begin to say we have reduced homicide rates [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5057.900000000001s)]
*  uh and and [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5065.1s)]
*  the [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5067.1s)]
*  So security becomes his way of sort of consolidating [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5068.62s)]
*  It's it's the it's the physical proof that he is the change, right? [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5073.5s)]
*  what's ironic about that is [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5077.82s)]
*  What's that? [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5081.42s)]
*  i'm not sure what it is, but it's the what the indictment of the [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5083.02s)]
*  Attorney general of the eastern district of new york says about that period of time [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5087.66s)]
*  And they say that naib bukele made an agreement with the gangs during his first three years in office [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5092.46s)]
*  to create the perception of reduced homicide rates [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5098.54s)]
*  that [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5103.58s)]
*  Benefited the president and his party [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5104.86s)]
*  In two elections in the sense this popularity that you're referring to in the early years of his presidency [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5107.58s)]
*  Is the result of an illicit negotiation according to the attorney general of new york with the very gangs. He is now accredited for [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5114.14s)]
*  Having combated right so there there is uh [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5121.5s)]
*  an irony to that [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5125.26s)]
*  Um, what i'll say though is after the three years of state of exception [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5127.02s)]
*  and that outburst of violence is understood to be sort of the sign that the [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5131.9800000000005s)]
*  Agreement between the bukele government and the gangs is over [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5136.46s)]
*  uh and [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5140.780000000001s)]
*  After you round up 85 000 people [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5142.3s)]
*  And imprison them indefinitely with no due process rights [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5145.820000000001s)]
*  Most of the population understands then that the government can do whatever it wants to whoever it wants [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5149.740000000001s)]
*  And there are no institutions in the country that are independent to intervene to protect rights [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5155.0199999999995s)]
*  And in that context polling shows that 80 of the population say they support president bukele [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5161.26s)]
*  While 83 of the population also says that they fear expressing an opinion that is not aligned with the president and his party [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5167.58s)]
*  So in a sense what the salvador people are telling you is sure I support the president [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5174.78s)]
*  But if I didn't I would be too afraid to tell you [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5179.42s)]
*  And so that's an indicator not of a free and open society but of a closed and autocratic society [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5182.78s)]
*  I think that's really important. You you made that point to me that you have to understand his approval rating in the context of [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5189.419999999999s)]
*  the [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5196.219999999999s)]
*  The situation the security situation but also the freedom of speech and the political and media climate that exists on the ground [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5197.0199999999995s)]
*  I think that's an important barometer for understanding. I think the approval of any [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5203.179999999999s)]
*  authoritarian government in the world really [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5207.08s)]
*  Um, it has been it's been interesting from over here in the u.s. Watching [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5209.74s)]
*  Bukele is kind of like public image and political efforts abroad evolve over time [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5215.88s)]
*  He he made himself kind of this early cheerleader of bitcoin. He was celebrated by various, you know [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5221.1s)]
*  silicon valley luminaries [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5228.38s)]
*  Who you know mostly ignored his authoritarian tendencies. They've also kind of mostly ignored the total failure [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5231.1s)]
*  By the government to get actual citizens of el salvador to use bitcoin, but never mind now [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5239.42s)]
*  It's clear he seemed to have pivoted a bit right now [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5245.9800000000005s)]
*  He's doing everything possible to cozy up to the trump administration. He's become a fixture on the kind of conservative political [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5248.14s)]
*  conference circuit [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5254.7s)]
*  How do you describe or make sense of his foreign policy worldview or or efforts at least? [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5256.3s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's a good question because he he was elected as a social democrat really [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5263.9800000000005s)]
*  Like if you listen to his campaign speeches in 2018 [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5269.0199999999995s)]
*  I would give him a job at a crystal solid human rights organization to do like workshops on democracy [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5271.9s)]
*  Like he was in social justice. He was like a social democrat when the sauvignon people fell in love with him [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5277.42s)]
*  And he transitions. There's multiple it's hard to know exactly how that happens [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5284.14s)]
*  but the um [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5288.3s)]
*  I think his worldview wears it now [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5290.38s)]
*  Uh, and this aligns very much with trump is he sees himself as a disruptor to a rules-based international system [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5293.42s)]
*  right [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5301.099999999999s)]
*  uh [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5301.9s)]
*  He says for example, he repeats this phrase often that human rights and democracy standards [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5303.34s)]
*  Are the failed prescriptions of the international community? [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5309.42s)]
*  Uh, and and I think you can see alignment with the way trump deals with dei for example [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5314.139999999999s)]
*  Or or he says sometimes like, uh, what does he say a radical left lunatic left agenda? [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5321.18s)]
*  Is what they have this shared idea? [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5327.9800000000005s)]
*  the the rules-based order [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5330.62s)]
*  This is an alternative to like the great power diplomacy that like that phrase [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5332.9400000000005s)]
*  um [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5338.38s)]
*  The powerful do what they what they can and the weak suffer what they must [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5339.9800000000005s)]
*  You know, that was the old system and then after world war two we decided oh, maybe we should have limits on power even [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5344.22s)]
*  Geopolitical power and it could benefit everybody they see that system as a limit on their own power or their own ability to act and they don't like it [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5349.5599999999995s)]
*  uh, so that is like one of the [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5357.74s)]
*  Like worldviews that unites them [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5360.0599999999995s)]
*  but unites [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5362.62s)]
*  the autocratic world in general, right? [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5364.219999999999s)]
*  And so bukele definitely identifies himself with that [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5367.82s)]
*  And I think specifically on the issue of like the deportations of venezuelans [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5371.0199999999995s)]
*  President bukele and president trump are allied in a in an effort to normalize [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5377.12s)]
*  um [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5383.759999999999s)]
*  This idea that in societies there are internal enemies [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5384.88s)]
*  and [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5390.48s)]
*  That these groups of people are such threats to society [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5391.44s)]
*  That they should not be protected by law [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5395.5199999999995s)]
*  And that the president claims a power to decide who those individuals and groups are [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5398.32s)]
*  President bukele has claimed that power in el sábado and exercised it [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5404.56s)]
*  To the extent of rounding up 85 000 people arbitrarily [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5408.64s)]
*  And president trump is now claiming that power [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5412.88s)]
*  in his [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5416.08s)]
*  Supposed response to the immigration [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5417.2s)]
*  Uh situation in the united states so they're literally declaring them terrorists. Yeah, right and one they're aligned in that that idea that [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5419.84s)]
*  Normalization of that and and and I think they're also aligned in trying to legitimize [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5426.860000000001s)]
*  The idea that you can [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5432.900000000001s)]
*  Take away that those people's rights [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5435.3s)]
*  And do whatever you want to them [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5438.820000000001s)]
*  And so that for president bukele he has this deep desire to be seen as an international model [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5442.02s)]
*  And he gets that when the united states contracts [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5449.46s)]
*  his [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5453.38s)]
*  penitentiary system [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5454.820000000001s)]
*  Known for massive systematic human rights violations [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5456.74s)]
*  The contract services from them you legitimize [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5460.5s)]
*  That model of security and it's a model of security like we talked about at the start of the conversation that's based on this idea [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5464.259999999999s)]
*  the human rights [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5472.179999999999s)]
*  The democratic checks and balances than any person or institution that would obstruct the power of the president [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5473.62s)]
*  to do what he [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5480.5s)]
*  Desires to [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5482.88s)]
*  And is an obstacle to security human rights and democracy themselves [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5484.179999999999s)]
*  It's a total country. Sorry i'm going on so long, but it's a total contradiction of what the universal declaration of human rights says [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5489.54s)]
*  Right, like this is I I read that and I get weepy. I hope people now go home and read just the preamble is good [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5496.419999999999s)]
*  Enough. It's like four paragraphs [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5501.7s)]
*  It's the world war two generation our grandparents saying to us [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5503.7s)]
*  Uh that when we reflect on one of the darkest moments in human history [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5507.54s)]
*  We conclude [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5513.0599999999995s)]
*  That fundamental respect [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5514.74s)]
*  For human rights and dignity is the basis. It's the foundation for peace and security in the world [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5517.0599999999995s)]
*  Not agreements between great powers [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5523.219999999999s)]
*  It's it's the limitation that is implicit in respecting human dignity and rights [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5525.86s)]
*  Uh, and and that's what's being turned on its head with these this on a micro level. That's what's being turned on its head [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5530.82s)]
*  um, I think uh [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5537.54s)]
*  That's something that like [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5540.099999999999s)]
*  You know [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5541.78s)]
*  In all societies like salvage in osago or maybe in the united states. I don't know who [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5542.9s)]
*  Really feels in the united states that their life has gotten way worse because of the trend that agua [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5547.54s)]
*  Uh, or how many people that is? [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5552.5s)]
*  but to [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5555.219999999999s)]
*  uh [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5556.66s)]
*  So it makes sense if you are affected by organized crime to say at first [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5558.0199999999995s)]
*  That you know, i'm i do what you need to do. You're right [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5562.099999999999s)]
*  Let's sacrifice rights in exchange for security but sooner or later [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5565.219999999999s)]
*  That the sacrifice of rights for one group [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5569.22s)]
*  Affects everybody and that's what we see. Absolutely and [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5572.099999999999s)]
*  You know last question for you. I mean, unfortunately the united states [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5576.0199999999995s)]
*  were [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5580.0199999999995s)]
*  Elon musk and the doge crew and trump are killing off usaid [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5581.54s)]
*  And you know the humanitarian work and the pro-democracy work that the u.s. Government used to do abroad [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5586.099999999999s)]
*  that gap is [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5591.22s)]
*  To the extent it can be being filled by ngos like yours [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5592.98s)]
*  I mean, what is it like for you? [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5596.82s)]
*  To work at a human rights organization in a country led by a scary powerful [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5599.46s)]
*  Authoritarian man who doesn't want your research seen by others and probably resents it [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5606.0s)]
*  I mean, do you feel is it dangerous to operate and then you know, can people? [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5612.26s)]
*  Listening support your work. Yeah [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5617.36s)]
*  I would say the crystal south [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5620.66s)]
*  Yeah [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zi_KSMlLI&t=5623.0599999999995s)]
