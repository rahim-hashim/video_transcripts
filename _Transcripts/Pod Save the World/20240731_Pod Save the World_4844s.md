# Venezuela’s Stolen Election Sparks Nationwide Protests Against President Maduro
**Pod Save the World:** [July 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98)
*  Welcome back to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Ben Rhodes. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2.0s)]
*  Ben, how you doing? You're on the road. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3.04s)]
*  I'm on the road. We got a little family vacation here. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=5.36s)]
*  Very nice. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=9.68s)]
*  Doing the dad thing, which is fun. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=10.64s)]
*  Ben is in Eastern Ukraine with the kids in the Donbass. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=12.88s)]
*  Yeah, we just figured we'd do a little Donbass this year. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=16.16s)]
*  Just kidding. Just kidding. He's somewhere nice. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  But it's good to see you. We got a big show today, Ben. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=23.36s)]
*  We've got a lot of Olympics on the TV. Are you guys like nonstop? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=26.88s)]
*  We're like neck deep in the Olympics here. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=30.16s)]
*  Swimming, gymnastics. I crushed a little fencing last night. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=34.08s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=37.68s)]
*  Watching a little fencing. That was good. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=38.32s)]
*  Those are my favorites, the sports that you would never otherwise watch. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=41.36s)]
*  Every four years you become an expert on the sport. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=44.4s)]
*  I love curling for that reason. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  Nothing goes better with curling than a couple edibles. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=48.96s)]
*  But we'll get to that later in the show. We're going to go deep on the Olympics, Ben. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=51.92s)]
*  We got a lot to cover today. We got to start with the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=56.24s)]
*  Sunday's presidential election in Venezuela and President Maduro's efforts to cling to power, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=58.56s)]
*  despite all evidence suggesting he lost. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  We're going to talk about how Vice President Harris should campaign on foreign policy and [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=67.04s)]
*  national security from now until election day. The latest from Israel and Gaza. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=70.88s)]
*  Ben and I are going to recap Bibi Net Yahoo's speech to a joint session of Congress from last [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=76.0s)]
*  week. We got some news from Sudan, Mali, and the Olympics, like I mentioned. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=81.84s)]
*  Ben, you did our interview earlier today. What are folks going to hear? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=86.16s)]
*  Yeah, I talked to Philip Gunson, who's with the International Crisis Group. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=88.8s)]
*  He's based in Caracas, so he talked to us from Venezuela. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=93.44s)]
*  We talked about the reaction to the election, the protests that have been taking place, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  what Maduro's up to, why it's pretty clear that the election was stolen, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=101.04s)]
*  what the opposition movement is, who's in it and what they want, and what the next steps might be [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=106.4s)]
*  both inside of Venezuela but also for the United States and some of the other Latin American [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=112.56s)]
*  governments that have been involved. Deep explainer really breaks it down. I encourage [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=116.56s)]
*  people, anybody who's got any interest in Venezuela, you will be smarter. I was smarter [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=122.56s)]
*  from having done this interview, so it was great. Excellent. I can't wait to hear that. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=126.4s)]
*  Let's lead with the political question about Venezuela though. This election happened on [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=130.8s)]
*  Sunday. Maduro declares victory. All available evidence says he lost and he's just trying to [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=135.04s)]
*  steal the election. That evidence includes public polling, results from a sampling of voting [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=140.24s)]
*  centers, et cetera. As you mentioned, there's protesters in the streets. You've got the usual [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=144.8s)]
*  countries like the Russia, China, Iran, Cuba's saying, congrats, Nicolas Maduro, you won, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=149.44s)]
*  but everybody else is like, uh-uh, this smells fishy. You've got leftist leaders in Colombia and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  Chile to the far right, Javier Millet in Argentina, demanding to see more evidence or basically just [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=162.8s)]
*  saying this is fraudulent. Again, we're going to get into more of these details, but Ben and I [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=168.32s)]
*  wanted to talk about the policy debate that's happening as we speak in Washington as a result [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=172.07999999999998s)]
*  of this election. A little bit of backstory. Last year, the Biden administration agreed to loosen [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  some sanctions on Venezuela's oil and gas sector in exchange for Maduro agreeing to a process that [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=183.04s)]
*  would lead to what were supposed to be free and fair elections that just happened. In April of [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=189.12s)]
*  this year, the Biden administration walked back the sanctions relief because it became clear that [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=194.88s)]
*  this election was not going to be free and fair after Maduro banned his strongest opponent from [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=199.68s)]
*  running, among other things. Now, you're seeing the usual suspects in Washington like the Marco [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=204.88s)]
*  Rubios of the world attacking Biden's policy and saying that even six months of sanctions relief [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=211.04s)]
*  was appeasement and they are demanding that everyone go back to the Trump era, maximum pressure, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=216.8s)]
*  sanctions policy that crushed the Venezuelan economy for four years and failed to dislodge [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=222.64s)]
*  Maduro. So Ben, obviously this outcome did not lead to free and fair elections. This wasn't [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  what anybody wanted. No one wants to see Maduro steal the election. But if you're a Venezuela hawk, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=235.04s)]
*  you currently have Maduro getting criticized from across the spectrum in Latin America. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=240.56s)]
*  You've got protesters on the streets saying Maduro is illegitimate. You've got people ripping down [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=246.07999999999998s)]
*  statues of Hugo Chavez. Like, isn't that what Marco Rubio wants to see happen? Yeah, I think that [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=251.2s)]
*  the utter and complete failure of Marco Rubio and Donald Trump's Venezuela policy didn't get enough [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=258.4s)]
*  scrutiny over the years. These are people just to replay the tape who decided to recognize Juan [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=264.32s)]
*  Guaido as the president of Venezuela a few years ago and moved these maximum pressure sanctions. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=270.0s)]
*  And that accomplished precisely nothing. And by the way, they said a lot of things that were not [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=275.84s)]
*  true. Mike Pompeo famously said there was a plane on the tarmac getting ready to take Maduro out of [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=280.8s)]
*  the country. Marco Rubio was taping these little videos as if he was a general on the border [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=285.44s)]
*  with Colombia, like calling up people to arms. None of that happened. And then John Bolton, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=291.52000000000004s)]
*  like appearing in the White House briefing room, remember, with a list of a number of [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=301.12s)]
*  troops that he was going to put into Venezuela. And that got us nothing. That got us nowhere. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=304.48s)]
*  Where did that get us? That got Maduro more entrenched in power in Venezuela, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=309.12s)]
*  more dependent on Russia and China, who were happy to gain more influence in Latin America. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=314.08s)]
*  Eight million Venezuelans left the country because of the crisis that was brought about by the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=319.44s)]
*  combination of Maduro's policies and the combination of U.S. sanctions. So that brought people to our [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=325.76s)]
*  border, making our border crisis worse. And also it was a huge burden on countries like [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=332.16s)]
*  Colombia that have millions of refugees. That was the result of their policy. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=336.08s)]
*  Now, I think Biden deserves credit for shifting course. And you're right. Look, this problem is [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=340.64s)]
*  not solved. Nicolas Maduro is clearly trying to steal an election. It's pretty clear that [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=346.47999999999996s)]
*  there was an overwhelming victory for the opposition. But what this policy did do is it [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=351.59999999999997s)]
*  allowed for the opposition to consolidate. It allowed for them to campaign across the country. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  It broadened the opposition movement. It's increased the pressure on Maduro. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  It's led to an election that has had not just the United States calling foul, but leftist leaders [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=365.91999999999996s)]
*  like Gabriel Barich of Chile has said that this election was clearly stolen. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=372.24s)]
*  You've got Lula in Brazil and Petro in Colombia also raising concerns about the election. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=376.71999999999997s)]
*  So look, I mean, you could just sanction the country forever and not change anything and have [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=381.68s)]
*  millions of people flooding out of the country and coming to our border. Or you can try something [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=387.76s)]
*  different. And this was the right play to make. Now, I think the question is, how do you make sure [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=392.56s)]
*  that the truth of the election gets out and what happened? How do you continue to support the [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=398.0s)]
*  opposition? How do you maintain that diplomatic front in Latin America to continue to try to [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=402.71999999999997s)]
*  squeeze those around Maduro to try to persuade him to relinquish power in some fashion? I don't [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=407.2s)]
*  claim that's easy, but it's definitely better to be doing it like this than to just throw a bunch [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=412.96s)]
*  of sanctions at people and make a bunch of statements in Washington that have no impact. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=417.84s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, right now the United States is not the story. And when Hugo Chavez was alive, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=421.52s)]
*  he always made the US the enemy. We were always a fault. Like he was demagogue in the US. That's [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=425.52s)]
*  not happening right now. It's protesters on the street that are threatening his clinging to power. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=429.67999999999995s)]
*  And you made a really good point there because Juan Guaido came to be seen as just kind of [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=433.91999999999996s)]
*  Washington's stooge down there. It did him no favors. And he basically left. He had to sneak [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=438.0s)]
*  out of the country into Colombia and come up to the US. And now he's politically irrelevant in [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=443.28s)]
*  Venezuela. That's what happens when the US wraps its arms fully around someone. When it's more like [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=447.04s)]
*  an organic opposition in the country, you've got a better chance to put pressure on Maduro. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=452.0s)]
*  Yeah. So I guess what these Republicans want is to just sanction the Venezuelan economy until no [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=456.64s)]
*  one lives in the country anymore. Like everyone just migrates north and then they can complain [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=462.16s)]
*  about it on Fox News because these sanctions are leading to increased migration and all the [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=466.0s)]
*  things they're worried about happening on the southern border. Yeah. It's like the border [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=471.28s)]
*  itself. They would rather have the problem than try to solve the problem. They would rather have [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=474.24s)]
*  Nicolas Maduro as a boogeyman in Venezuela that they can rail about and say he's a communist and [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=478.88s)]
*  the communists in the US are backing him up and everything. They don't actually want to solve the [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=483.92s)]
*  problem. They just want the appearance of a crisis. It's the same thing they've done with Cuba policy [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=488.72s)]
*  for decades and it's led to nowhere. Yeah. And it's just like, obviously like, look, Maduro's a bad [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=492.72s)]
*  guy. He lost his election. He should go. I wish there was some mechanism to force him to follow [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=496.96000000000004s)]
*  the will of the voters. I just don't think American sanctions are going to be it because they haven't [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=502.16s)]
*  been to date. It's also like absolutely maddening then to watch Republican idiots like Matt Gaetz [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=506.32000000000005s)]
*  tweet things like, quote, Maduro lost the election in Venezuela badly, then simply declared victory [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=512.32s)]
*  anyway. He is an illegitimate dictator. Hmm. Who, Matt, who does that sound like to you? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=517.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, not a lot of self-awareness there. I'll say one thing about Maduro. Chavez was a charismatic [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=522.72s)]
*  guy who won a Democratic election and frankly used a bunch of oil revenues to try to take care of [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=529.12s)]
*  his kind of populist agenda. Maduro has none of that charisma, none of that skill, but he does [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=537.2s)]
*  have that kind of stubborn mindset. I met him once or a couple of times, one time with Barack Obama [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=542.88s)]
*  to some of the Americas in 2015. We'd met with the Cubans. We arranged to meet with him. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=548.16s)]
*  Tommy was one of the things he would appreciate as a press person. We had to find a venue that [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=554.4s)]
*  there were no photographs possible. Nice. You want to be photographed with a guy? It's like a dark room. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=558.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, no, literally. We were backstage in some dark backstage area, standing, not sitting, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=563.4399999999999s)]
*  talked to this guy for a few minutes and he just kept telling Obama, I'm a revolutionary. I'm a [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=570.64s)]
*  revolutionary. What he meant by that is he'll never relinquish power. He's a true believer. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=574.56s)]
*  Whether that's a posture or not, it doesn't matter. He's not going to go on his own, but [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=581.04s)]
*  essentially you have to create the conditions where there are enough people around him [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=586.0799999999999s)]
*  that he can sustain his power. He's relied on a combination of the military and a bit of a [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=590.9599999999999s)]
*  left-wing base and just some corrupt people that he's taken care of. You've got to peel off enough [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=596.9599999999999s)]
*  those people that the house of cards crumbles. Look, Matt Gaetz, not exactly a deeply thoughtful [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=602.08s)]
*  analyst of the situation. It just shows you this is about demagoguery and not about solving problems. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=610.24s)]
*  Yeah. Maduro, he started his career as a bus driver and he came up in the labor union movement. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=615.2800000000001s)]
*  He was early on the Chavez bandwagon and was rewarded and leveled up throughout his career, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=620.24s)]
*  but no, he's nowhere near the charisma. Also, just to prove, Ben, that there are very dumb [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=626.24s)]
*  people on both sides, I also wanted to flag that the Democratic Socialists of America's [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=630.72s)]
*  International Committee put out a statement congratulating Maduro on his win. I guess, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=635.28s)]
*  if you're a socialist, it's okay to steal elections now and just beat up protesters? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=640.72s)]
*  Sounds like a good policy. Yeah. It does the left no favors, guys. We should be standing for [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=646.48s)]
*  some multi-democracy and social justice. That's not what Nicolas Maduro has been building in [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=651.6s)]
*  Venezuela if you have two eyes to see with. I worry that that kind of thing undermines [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=658.64s)]
*  good leftist causes around the world and in the hemisphere. It undermines the positive aspects of [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=664.48s)]
*  that agenda when you refuse to call balls and strikes when you see something like an election [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=673.1999999999999s)]
*  is stolen in Venezuela. Yeah. Let's care more about the policies and principles and not just [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=677.92s)]
*  the label of the party on the ballot here. Look, this Venezuela might be an issue in our [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=682.72s)]
*  election. I kind of doubt it, Ben, but there's a hundred days till the election. Normally, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=688.4s)]
*  these elections, the campaigns go on for years. On the foreign policy side, you do big foreign [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=693.36s)]
*  policy speeches. Obama went on an international trip during the 2008 campaign. That went well for [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=699.1999999999999s)]
*  us. Mitt Romney went on one in 2012. Much worse results. He managed to offend pretty much everyone [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=706.0799999999999s)]
*  in the UK. Only time I've ever liked Boris Johnson was on that trip when he was attacking [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=711.52s)]
*  Mitt Romney. It's a dog and pony show in service of showing your foreign policy [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=715.28s)]
*  bonafides and passing what reporters always call the commander in chief test, which basically means [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=720.4s)]
*  does this person look like the commander in chief, which is an entirely subjective [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=725.76s)]
*  determination that has very clear gender and racial biases, but it's like part of the political [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=730.9599999999999s)]
*  conversation. Ben, the question is, what do we think Harris should do in the next 100 days [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=737.36s)]
*  to demonstrate to voters her foreign policy chops? The good news, as we talked about last week, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=744.72s)]
*  is she has quite a head start. She had four years as VP. She was in all the PDB briefings, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=751.0400000000001s)]
*  the high level security meetings. She was at the international summits representing the Biden [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=756.4s)]
*  administration. She's met with, I think, 150 heads of state, according to her campaign, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=762.32s)]
*  or 150 world leaders. But this is kind of about manufacturing events to the extent you need them [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=767.6s)]
*  in the next couple months to sell that image. Do you have any recommendations for her team [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=773.6s)]
*  in case they're listening? Yeah. I think you're right. The compressed time schedule means that [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=778.4s)]
*  I don't think there's time to give a series of speeches and obviously take a foreign trip, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=784.0s)]
*  the kinds of things that people normally do. Now, the good news for her, because of her deep [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=790.96s)]
*  experience, is that she's been on foreign trips. We talked about it last week. 21 countries as VP. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=795.6800000000001s)]
*  Mitt Romney and Obama in 2008, they wanted to show that they could travel to other countries [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=801.5200000000001s)]
*  and meet world leaders and talk about foreign policy. She has done that. I think that's important [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=806.1600000000001s)]
*  for them to remind people and for surrogates to get out. I think they want to show a deep bench [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=811.0400000000001s)]
*  of people that can validate what she's done, because she's probably going to mainly be out [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=815.9200000000001s)]
*  there talking about the economy and democracy and abortion and revision for the country. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=820.48s)]
*  But this is an important thing to do. Now, I think there's what can she do to show her bona fides [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=825.9200000000001s)]
*  and then what can she do to signal where she'll be different? I think she should be talking about [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=831.12s)]
*  her experience and working it into her stump speech and the contrast that she can make about [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=838.4000000000001s)]
*  how she stood up for democracy, she stood up for Ukraine, she stood up to bullies and dictators [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=842.5600000000001s)]
*  like Putin. That foreign policy message is very similar to her domestic message. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=850.0s)]
*  I think she can work it in. It's not like a big swerve where you have to say, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=856.08s)]
*  and just as we need to promote security and prosperity at home, so much we do abroad. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=859.68s)]
*  I wrote that transition a lot. She can seamlessly tie in the attributes of her leadership at home [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=864.4s)]
*  to what she's doing abroad. I think she should hit certain constituencies that are really important. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=870.8s)]
*  An obvious one is there are large diaspora populations of Ukrainians and Eastern Europeans [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=875.76s)]
*  in those swing states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin. I think it'd be important to do an [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=881.04s)]
*  event with them to highlight the absurdity of Donald Trump's position on Russia and her strong [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=886.08s)]
*  leadership on it. I think it's important where people haven't necessarily seen her is in front [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=890.96s)]
*  of military audiences. Yeah, I was thinking that too. Yeah. I think it'd be important for her to [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=896.0s)]
*  visit base communities, military families, veterans. She should definitely be talking [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=899.76s)]
*  to veterans groups, laying out her credentials to be commander in chief, which is a little different [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=908.56s)]
*  than foreign policy itself. But speaking about what they've done for veterans in the Biden [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=914.4s)]
*  administration, which is a lot, the PAC-DAC expanded tremendous amounts of support by people like John [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=918.56s)]
*  Stewart, who got a lot of attention, but extended a lot of additional benefits to veterans who were [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=925.2s)]
*  impacted by kind of toxic sites in Iraq and Afghanistan. So some of those kind of military [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=930.4000000000001s)]
*  type events, I think would be important. But then I think the opportunity for her is she can take the [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=936.24s)]
*  positive of the Biden record, like support for Ukraine, where she has been in the mix. But I [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=942.08s)]
*  think on something like Gaza, she can start a bit fresh and have different messaging that makes it, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=947.6800000000001s)]
*  as she did the other day, where she said, I'm not going to be silent about the Palestinians. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=955.12s)]
*  She can indicate where she's probably going to have a difference going forward from Joe Biden on [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=958.56s)]
*  Gaza and reach some of those voters in Michigan. I think she should sit down with them and not [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=963.36s)]
*  necessarily at a big public event, but kind of show a willingness to listen and to kind of reconsider [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=968.24s)]
*  approaches on Gaza and the Palestinian issue in talking to Arab and Muslim American communities [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=973.2s)]
*  in Michigan. I think that'd be important thing for her to do. And then I also think she can kind [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=978.8s)]
*  of mobilize people around some of the issues that don't get a ton of attention in the foreign [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=983.12s)]
*  policy discussion, but do matter to some voters, like climate, where she can connect what they're [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=987.2s)]
*  doing on clean energy here to the kind of leadership she'd bring abroad. And I know this is, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=992.0s)]
*  OK, I'm going to be wonky here, but we're policy nerds. She's played a key role in the AI policies [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=998.4s)]
*  for this administration. Yeah, she's like the AI czar. She actually is the AI czar, not the [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1003.68s)]
*  borders czar, but yeah, she is. And that's going to be a big issue for the next four years. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1008.32s)]
*  It's going to transform how we live our lives. It's going to transform international security. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1013.2800000000001s)]
*  So I think she can talk about being credentialed to take on the kind of issues of the future, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1017.84s)]
*  which kind of fits with like this passing the torch to a new generation climate and technology. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1022.1600000000001s)]
*  These are the issues that are going to reshape our lives. So there's a lot to be done here. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1027.2s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. I mean, I think, yeah, I was trying to think of because it's so compressed, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1031.1200000000001s)]
*  what are the top three? And I agree, the number one, really number one, two and three is the [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1035.28s)]
*  connection that the president of the United States has with the United States military as [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1040.8s)]
*  commander in chief. So I agree with you, getting to base communities is very important. I do think [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1045.04s)]
*  she, again, has a head start here because I believe she delivered the West Point commencement in like [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1049.44s)]
*  2023. You're right that they have a great record on veterans issues that they should be talking [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1055.44s)]
*  about more. So I would definitely highlight that as much as humanly possible and military families [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1060.24s)]
*  as well. And then I do think you want to do something that just like somehow shows you're [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1064.64s)]
*  tough on China. Maybe you tie that into combating fentanyl because that's a critical issue in a lot [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1068.72s)]
*  of these states. You mentioned Israel and Gaza, we'll get to that later. But she could talk about [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1075.68s)]
*  abortion rights, not just in the United States, but around the globe. I think that's something [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1080.5600000000002s)]
*  that she could speak from like really authentically and passionately. You end up rolling out a lot of [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1084.3200000000002s)]
*  big shot national security endorsements and supporters to kind of signal who your team will [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1091.2s)]
*  be going forward. Things I would not do, I would not do a big foreign policy framing speech or [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1097.04s)]
*  like wonky, it's not worth the time. It's not going to get covered. Don't do it. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1104.8s)]
*  You can write something. You've got less than a hundred days here. You don't need to burn a [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1110.0s)]
*  couple of days on something like that. As someone who wrote those speeches, you can write an article [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1114.0s)]
*  if you want to do that. Or blog. Yeah. I mean, and to your point, like, so I chair this organization, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1117.92s)]
*  National Security Action, that does a lot of politics for progressives on foreign policy. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1122.8000000000002s)]
*  We've done a lot of polling. And one of the things we see in the polling is these soft Trump voters [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1128.0s)]
*  in places like Pennsylvania and Michigan, you know, a lot of them are kind of are veterans. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1132.24s)]
*  A lot of them are, you know, kind of older white people, to be blunt, who, you know, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1137.1200000000001s)]
*  feel a lot of cultural affinity for Trump, but also feel a lot of discomfort with how he politicizes [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1143.76s)]
*  the military, how he won't send up to Russia. Like, these are swing voters. And these are places to [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1148.7199999999998s)]
*  reach them and putting, if she, you know, sometimes she can do it herself, sometimes getting surrogates [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1155.04s)]
*  in those communities, talking to those voters. You know, I think that's an important target, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1159.28s)]
*  you know, and, you know, she's going to, if she can clear that commander in chief bar, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1164.1599999999999s)]
*  you know, that that matters to those voters a lot. And I think she's very well positioned to do it. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1168.72s)]
*  And the law enforcement piece helps. I mean, you mentioned Fennel. That's a really good, you know, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1174.48s)]
*  one idea Tommy might be like, a lot of governors are doing good work in dealing with Fennel in [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1177.92s)]
*  their states. You know, people like Josh Shapiro, people like Tim Walz in Minnesota, people like [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1184.96s)]
*  Westmore in Maryland, you know, do some event themed around stopping Fennel across the border [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1189.68s)]
*  and dealing with the whole supply chain of the problem to the kind of domestic policies around [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1196.08s)]
*  opportunity in communities to the border policies. You know, she can kind of take these issues that [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1201.76s)]
*  aren't necessarily always seen as national security issues and show that she's ready to [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1206.96s)]
*  tackle them. And frankly, her law enforcement background should help with that. Yeah. And [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1210.56s)]
*  her two of her VP selection possibilities have military backgrounds. You got Mark Kelly, who was [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1214.0s)]
*  in the Air Force and then an astronaut. But then Tim Walz was in the Army National Guard for like [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1219.52s)]
*  20 years and has a vast experience to draw from is also like your, you know, avuncular, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1225.84s)]
*  you know, uncle. I think that's redundant, but you got my point. Yeah. Last thing on this, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1231.76s)]
*  if Harris gets attacked on Afghanistan, this clip and you know, the attack would be, you know, the [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1237.6s)]
*  withdrawal and how it unfolded at the end. This clip of Trump's former national security advisor, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1244.8799999999999s)]
*  John Bolton on Newsmax of all places could be quite helpful. Let's listen. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1250.48s)]
*  You know what made us less safe is when Biden pulled us out of Afghanistan, 13 Americans died. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1256.88s)]
*  And now the Trump steal now that was Taliban tells us back off. Don't kill Al Qaeda. Right. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1261.68s)]
*  Are you out of your mind? Same thing they would have done under Donald Trump. No. Who cut the [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1269.04s)]
*  deal, Eric? Who cut the deal? Who delivered a deal? No, no, no. Trump wanted to want to [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1274.24s)]
*  put Trump has done. He wanted to leave 2500 people there. Remember, sir, let's not. No, he did not. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1280.4s)]
*  He absolutely did not. He did. Eric, you don't know what you're talking about. He wanted everybody [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1286.3200000000002s)]
*  out. He cut a deal to do exactly that. Anyone that disagrees with you, we don't know what we're [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1291.44s)]
*  talking about. Trump said leave 2500 until we have a smooth transition power. He did not. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1295.0400000000002s)]
*  Look, he said that after he cut the deal. The deal cut us down to zero. That's what Trump wanted. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1301.3600000000001s)]
*  He wanted everybody out. The record on that is completely clear over time. Biden pulled them out. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1306.4s)]
*  What with America? No, there. No, read the deal. Eric, have you ever read the deal? Stop. Yeah, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1312.24s)]
*  I know you got to go before you're embarrassed even further. I'm embarrassed. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1317.52s)]
*  I'm sorry. I know that was very long, but look, no, it's worth it. Keep every minute in there. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1322.5600000000002s)]
*  It's so interesting when these like right wing news outlets have a little bit of truth kind of [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1326.96s)]
*  like poke its head through on their air and they immediately like shut it down and kick John Bolton [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1330.64s)]
*  of all people off. Yeah, it's like pouring water on like some robot, you know, just totally. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1334.96s)]
*  I mean, the Trump timeline was faster. Trump wanted to get to zero faster than Joe Biden, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1340.0s)]
*  you know, and but look, I think she can look we've we've we've, you know, we've praised [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1344.96s)]
*  aspects of Biden's foreign policy. We've been critical of some of them. I think where they've [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1352.16s)]
*  sometimes had trouble, including on the Afghan evacuation, including on Gaza is Joe Biden gets [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1356.24s)]
*  very defensive, you know. Yeah, they dug in on it being like this massive evacuation in the history [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1363.36s)]
*  of human history or something like that. That was the wrong like she doesn't have to do that. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1368.8s)]
*  You know, she could even say like, look, I agreed with the decision. We can acknowledge that it [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1373.6s)]
*  could have gone better. It's obviously tragic that we lost Americans. It's tragic what's happened [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1378.56s)]
*  to Afghan women. She doesn't have to be as defensive even though she's been a part of some [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1382.9599999999998s)]
*  of these policies. And look, this is another issue. Again, very small thing, but I like what [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1388.72s)]
*  you said about abortion globally. Whenever you can globalize your concerns, I think it resonates [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1393.6000000000001s)]
*  more. And so when she talks about women, you know, that gives her a framework to talk with empathy [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1399.84s)]
*  about Afghan women and how we can do more to support them. You know, so there's a variety of [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1406.0s)]
*  ways in which on some of these kind of more turbulent aspects of the Biden foreign policy, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1410.48s)]
*  she doesn't have to kind of be as dug in in defending every single aspect of it. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1415.9199999999998s)]
*  She can defend the broad strokes, right? We wanted to end the war on terror. We wanted to [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1421.9199999999998s)]
*  concede a little bit. Yeah, for sure. I mean, but one issue that will definitely come up will be [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1425.4399999999998s)]
*  Israel. And obviously, like there's a lot going on. Saturday, we saw the deadliest attack in [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1430.56s)]
*  Israel or Israel occupied territory since October 7th, when a rocket hit a soccer field in the [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1436.7199999999998s)]
*  Israeli occupied Golan Heights, killing 12 children and injuring 30 others. The victims [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1442.0s)]
*  were members of the Druze ethnic and religious minority group. So so far, Israel and the White [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1447.68s)]
*  House have blamed Hezbollah for the attack. They've claimed they fired an Iranian made rocket from [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1453.28s)]
*  Lebanon. Hezbollah denied responsibility, but it doesn't seem at all credible. The Israeli Prime [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1458.08s)]
*  Minister, Bibi Netanyahu, was in the US at the time. He cut his visit short. He returned to Israel [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1463.52s)]
*  saying, quote, Our response is coming and it will be severe. Since that time, Israel's hit a number [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1468.08s)]
*  of targets in southern Lebanon on Sunday. And then on Tuesday, a few minutes, a few hours before we [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1473.6799999999998s)]
*  started recording here, the IDF conducted an airstrike in Beirut that they said targeted a [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1479.28s)]
*  senior Hezbollah commander. So Ben, you know, the thing that like every national security expert [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1484.48s)]
*  has been most worried about since October 7th was the risk of fighting between Hezbollah and Israel [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1490.24s)]
*  spiraling out of control, which would leave Israel fighting a two front war against in the case of [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1496.3999999999999s)]
*  Hezbollah, a much better armed adversary, and it could draw Iran like into the fight directly. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1501.84s)]
*  The White House since the strike has been playing down concern about this spilling into a broader [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1507.6s)]
*  regional war. But you know, and also I talked to a couple of smart journalists in the region who said [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1513.6799999999998s)]
*  to me basically like, look, if these were Jewish kids who were killed, all hell would have broken [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1517.84s)]
*  loose. But because these are Syrian Druze victims, the response is likely to be less severe. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1522.0s)]
*  That sounds very crass because it is, but it's probably right. What's your level of anxiety at [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1529.44s)]
*  the moment about potential escalation between Israel and Hezbollah? I mean, it's very high. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1534.56s)]
*  First of all, we should say, Tommy, that like Donald Trump, right after October 7th, right, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1539.12s)]
*  he goes on this kind of weird riff where he bashes Biden, he bashes Bibi, and then he says, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1545.2s)]
*  Hezbollah is very smart. They're all very smart. And then being fully self-aware of what he was [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1552.4s)]
*  saying, he said, the press doesn't like when I see things like that. And, you know, like, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1558.32s)]
*  so weird, any other presidential candidate says stuff like that. And it's like an albatross [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1563.28s)]
*  around their neck to the election that we know that gravity doesn't seem to apply to Trump. But [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1567.52s)]
*  let's just put a pin in that. Look, I'm very worried because what's happening here is both sides [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1571.12s)]
*  are like, don't want to back down. Right. So Hezbollah didn't go all in with Hamas after [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1577.6000000000001s)]
*  October 7th, but they, you know, they launched these rockets periodically. That's been enough [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1585.0400000000002s)]
*  to displace tens of thousands of Israelis from the north. That's embarrassing to Netanyahu. So [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1589.2s)]
*  he launches these strikes back and there's this kind of tit for tat testing and neither side seems [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1593.7600000000002s)]
*  to want the full war or else they would have had it by now. But they keep doing things that cause [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1599.0400000000002s)]
*  the other side to respond. And it's a big escalation to take an action in Beirut, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1603.52s)]
*  not just to target a senior commander, but to be hitting things in Beirut or hitting things in the [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1609.36s)]
*  Beqa Valley in Lebanon. And look, if this explodes, like this could be a complete catastrophe. This [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1613.6s)]
*  could be a much bigger war that devastates Lebanon, obviously makes northern Israel less secure. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1619.6s)]
*  And the reason I'm worried about it is that the only way to stop this, it's the same thing with [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1626.8799999999999s)]
*  the Houthis by the way in Yemen, is for there to be a ceasefire in Gaza. Like so long as there is [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1631.68s)]
*  a war going on between Israel and Hamas, these other groups like Hezbollah and the Houthis will [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1637.8400000000001s)]
*  continue to poke and press. Israel will continue to respond. And you just, you know, at some point [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1644.0800000000002s)]
*  the brush fire could catch, you know? And there's like, there's pretty loud factions in Israel [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1650.24s)]
*  pushing Netanyahu to go harder into Lebanon. I mean, a lot of the reporting early on was that [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1655.3600000000001s)]
*  Bibi basically like pushed back even people that I think we would feel were the more reasonable [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1660.64s)]
*  members of the coalition. And then the White House leaned on Bibi hard not to launch a second front [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1665.76s)]
*  into Lebanon. So like, this has been kept contained with a lot of effort to date. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1670.96s)]
*  Yeah. And if people are wondering like, why would Israel do this? There are people in the Israeli [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1675.3600000000001s)]
*  far right, which is, you know, a big chunk of the government who are like, this is the time to just [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1680.24s)]
*  close all these accounts. You know, like, this is the time to level Gaza. This is the time to try [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1685.2s)]
*  to take out Hezbollah. This is the time to annex the West Bank. That's what all these people want. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1691.2s)]
*  And because Bibi is dependent on them, he has to kind of give these people enough of what they want [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1696.4s)]
*  to stay in power. And that can lead to this momentum that can take you into war. And Bibi is [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1701.44s)]
*  clearly, and then obviously Hamas is part of it too, but Bibi's clearly been a huge obstruction [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1707.3600000000001s)]
*  to getting a ceasefire in Gaza. And so long as that is the case, this is going to be dangerously [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1714.56s)]
*  teetering on the brink of escalation. And with our election coming up too, that's a dangerous [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1721.04s)]
*  time too, because it may be that Bibi might want to embarrass Biden by escalating in [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1725.84s)]
*  southern Lebanon. We don't, you know, I wouldn't put anything past the guy. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1731.6799999999998s)]
*  So it's a very dangerous moment. Also, Ben, adding to your little like [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1735.2s)]
*  anxiety checklist is the fact that Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan said he might send [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1739.6s)]
*  troops into Israel to defend the Palestinians. So that's a fun little one. That's a fun new [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1743.36s)]
*  wrinkle. A NATO country. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1747.52s)]
*  From our friends in Turkey. But let's turn to Netanyahu's speech before we get to some [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1748.7199999999998s)]
*  more things out of Gaza. So last week, Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu was in the U.S. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1753.28s)]
*  He addressed a joint session of Congress. The smartest thing he did was to schedule it on [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1758.1599999999999s)]
*  Wednesday so that you and I would have a week to cool off. But I did get to vent with Ali Valshi [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1761.84s)]
*  on Pod Save America right after, which was great timing. It was great. I enjoyed that. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1766.7199999999998s)]
*  He's so great. I love that guy and very thoughtful and measured. He actually calmed me down. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1770.72s)]
*  For those of you who didn't watch the speech, you made the right call. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1777.2s)]
*  But here's a sampling of what you missed. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1781.28s)]
*  Israel has enabled more than 40,000 A trucks to enter Gaza. That's half a million tons of food. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1784.0s)]
*  And that's more than 3000 calories for every man, woman and child in Gaza. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1792.0s)]
*  If there are Palestinians in Gaza who aren't getting enough food, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1798.24s)]
*  it's not because Israel is blocking it. It's because Hamas is stealing it. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1802.08s)]
*  The ICC prosecutor accuses Israel of deliberately targeting civilians. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1806.8799999999999s)]
*  What in God's green earth is he talking about? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1813.28s)]
*  The IDF has dropped millions of flyers, sent millions of text messages, made hundreds of [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1817.2s)]
*  thousands of phone calls to get Palestinian civilians out of harm's way. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1823.52s)]
*  But at the same time, Hamas does everything in its power to put Palestinian civilians in harm's way. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1828.88s)]
*  Many anti-Israel protesters, many choose to stand with evil. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1836.16s)]
*  So these protesters burn American flags even on the 4th of July. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1841.2s)]
*  And I wish to salute the fraternity brothers at the University of North Carolina [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1846.8s)]
*  who protected the American flag, protected the American flag against these anti-Israel protesters. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1851.36s)]
*  So Netanyahu got about 50 standing ovations during the speech. That said 60 lawmakers boycotted, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1859.52s)]
*  including Nancy Pelosi, who later said the speech was, quote, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1866.7199999999998s)]
*  the worst presentation of any foreign dignitary invited and honored with the privilege of [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1869.52s)]
*  addressing the Congress. Amen, Nancy. We love you for many reasons. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1873.28s)]
*  Vice President Harris did not attend due to a sketching conflict, but she did meet with [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1877.5200000000002s)]
*  Netanyahu one on one. More on that in a minute. But then, like just on the speech itself, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1880.88s)]
*  I expected this to be terrible because of 2015. But I was genuinely shocked at how bad and hackish [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1885.8400000000001s)]
*  and politicized it actually was. It really did sound like a speech that Netanyahu should have [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1893.0400000000002s)]
*  given to the Republican National Convention. He should have been in Milwaukee a couple of days [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1898.64s)]
*  earlier. And then to like see members of the U.S. Congress giving this man a standing ovation [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1902.16s)]
*  as he attacked American citizens for protesting and basically called them terrorist supporters [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1909.0400000000002s)]
*  was genuinely disgraceful and insulting and just felt like an American to have to sit through that. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1914.96s)]
*  So, I don't know, you told me before we started recording that you thought the speech was [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1921.1200000000001s)]
*  well-crafted and poignant, but I just wondered why you had that take. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1925.1200000000001s)]
*  I had to watch the whole thing. And I have to say it was the most shameful and disgraceful speech [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1929.36s)]
*  that I've ever seen delivered to a joint session of Congress. He lied repeatedly. And it's worth [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1937.6s)]
*  pointing out. He claimed that Israel's doing nothing to obstruct food getting into Palestinians [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1945.36s)]
*  and is bragging about their calorie count, when in fact his own government announced a policy of [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1951.12s)]
*  cutting off all food and fuel into Gaza and has continually blocked aid from getting in and has [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1956.56s)]
*  led to famine-like conditions in parts of the Gaza Strip. He claimed that the IDF drops all these [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1962.32s)]
*  leaflets and doesn't target civilians while ignoring the fact that the IDF has dropped [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1969.6799999999998s)]
*  scores of 2,000-pound bombs on heavily populated civilian areas, leading even Joe Biden, whose [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1974.24s)]
*  policy has been to hug Israel, to say that they're indiscriminately killing civilians. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1981.68s)]
*  That's something that we can all see with our eyes. That's something that is evident in the rubble [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1986.3200000000002s)]
*  that used to be the Gaza Strip. So, he was there to gaslight and to obfuscate and to lie, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1991.28s)]
*  frankly, about what they're doing. And then, just serving up these attacks on protesters, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=1998.24s)]
*  it's red meat at the RNC. He's on the side of the UNC frat bros, not exactly the allyship that I [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2004.72s)]
*  would be seeking. He said something like, the Iranian government is funding the protests outside [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2015.3600000000001s)]
*  the Capitol, this conspiracy theory, trying to delegitimize anybody that might oppose his Gaza [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2021.52s)]
*  policy, not just as an anti-Semite, which is the charge they usually throw at everybody, but as [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2027.92s)]
*  some kind of Iranian-backed agent. And to have that be applauded, to have all this be applauded, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2033.28s)]
*  there's nowhere else where this man could stand up and get 50 standing ovations except the United [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2038.48s)]
*  States Congress. What an embarrassing, disgraceful commentary on the U.S. Congress, that there's no [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2043.76s)]
*  place on earth that Bibi Netanyahu could get that reception except in that chamber. What is that [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2050.24s)]
*  about people? Let's wake up here. And the reality is the guy's got 70% disapproval in Israel. He [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2054.88s)]
*  would be protested if he tried to give that speech in Israel, and he'd be called out for lying in [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2061.6s)]
*  Israel. The only good news, Tommy, is it was completely stepped on by the fact that Biden [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2067.2s)]
*  gave his own speech that night. Bibi's this diminished figure. He thought he'd start this [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2072.96s)]
*  big debate here. We're probably the only ones still talking about this six days later, just so we can [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2077.92s)]
*  dunk on that speech. He didn't have any impact. He didn't move the needle here at all. All he did is [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2083.52s)]
*  show what a bunch of lapdogs, a bunch of members of Congress are. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2090.48s)]
*  Yeah, it was really embarrassing. We didn't expect much out of him, but he did not show up [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2093.84s)]
*  and deliver a ceasefire or any good news. He didn't take any accountability for October 7th [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2099.28s)]
*  and the mistakes that were made or anything that's come after. He didn't show any empathy [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2104.72s)]
*  for the Palestinian people. There was no nuance or suggestion that disagreement with Israeli [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2108.8s)]
*  government policies is completely legitimate and that protests are a constitutional right [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2117.6s)]
*  for American citizens. He just attacked everyone who disagreed with him as an enemy, as if they [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2122.0s)]
*  were part of Hamas. He used all these morons in the chamber, all these members of Congress, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2127.36s)]
*  as political props, and they were just fine, clapping along. The most cynical part was when [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2133.36s)]
*  he kept calling out the family members of hostages or members of the IDF who were wounded and [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2140.56s)]
*  combat. While we all know that this guy is refusing to cut a deal that would get the [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2147.52s)]
*  hostages home and end the war so that more Israeli citizens aren't killed, as well as [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2154.88s)]
*  people in Gaza. The whole thing was just so partisan and cynical and gross. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2162.64s)]
*  A couple things. A lot of things I want to say about this. The first 15 minutes were this [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2167.36s)]
*  bizarre mix of George W. Bush-style State of the Union. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2172.64s)]
*  Totally George Bush-style, yes. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2176.24s)]
*  Like, call up the IDF soldiers, know that you're going to get applause. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2177.52s)]
*  Then there was this weird, he was trumpeting the diversity of Israel. He was calling out the fact [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2183.12s)]
*  that there are Arabs and Muslims fighting in the IDF. Clearly somebody was like, you should do this, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2189.68s)]
*  it'd be smart politics. But the reality is it felt so disingenuous coming from a guy [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2195.7599999999998s)]
*  that has empowered a bunch of racists and literal terrorists in his cabinet. Spare me the lectures [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2200.64s)]
*  about diversity from this guy. But then what was interesting, Tommy, is he couldn't help himself. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2207.04s)]
*  After the 15 minutes of the soft stuff and the Bush-style warmongering, then he pivots the red [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2211.2799999999997s)]
*  meat and you could feel him get more comfortable as he became more and more partisan. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2220.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah, spitting mad too. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2224.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh, and the one thing they put out, they said he was going to lay out his plan for the day after. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2226.3199999999997s)]
*  That was in the preview of the speech. He didn't say a single new thing. He said, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2230.32s)]
*  basically we have to have security control open-ended in Gaza, which is precisely the [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2234.96s)]
*  position that the Biden administration has been pressuring him to move away from. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2239.6000000000004s)]
*  And so nothing new in this speech whatsoever. To come all the way here and not have a single [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2244.7200000000003s)]
*  new thing to say about how you're going to end this war is embarrassing. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2248.8s)]
*  It really was. And so Vice President Harris skipped the speech itself. She very conveniently [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2252.8s)]
*  had another thing planned, but she did meet with B.B. one-on-one and delivered remarks [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2259.12s)]
*  afterwards. Here's a clip from that. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2264.48s)]
*  What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2266.88s)]
*  The images of dead children and desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2271.7599999999998s)]
*  for the second, third or fourth time. We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2280.56s)]
*  We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering, and I will not be silent. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2287.92s)]
*  So Harris didn't offer any new policy or break from President Biden's policies in any way. But [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2294.7200000000003s)]
*  a lot of progressives praised her tone and the empathy she showed for the Palestinian people. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2300.96s)]
*  Others were less kind. Trump, who met with Netanyahu down at Mar-a-Lago, [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2307.2000000000003s)]
*  called Harris's meeting with him terrible and insulting. And then Trump later said that, [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2311.6s)]
*  any Jewish person that votes for Kamala or a Democrat should immediately have their head [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2316.64s)]
*  examined. So that was nice. And then Trump also echoed comments made on background by a bunch of [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2320.48s)]
*  Israeli officials that you'd see popping up in the press who said that Harris's comments about [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2326.2400000000002s)]
*  the humanitarian situation were exaggerated and that what she said could delay the war. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2331.6800000000003s)]
*  This is a quote from the Times of Israel. Quote, is the harm to Palestinian civilians really the [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2337.12s)]
*  problem right now? What is Hamas supposed to think when it hears this? The official asked. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2343.36s)]
*  I hope it won't lead to regression in the talks because we've made a lot of progress. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2347.52s)]
*  This is from some probably Ron Dermer or some political hack around Bibi Netanyahu, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2351.52s)]
*  who is a part of the team that is currently dragging out the ceasefire talks and not getting [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2358.2400000000002s)]
*  to a deal. So Ben, what did you make of Harris's comments? And isn't it interesting how what Trump [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2364.4s)]
*  said and what this official from the Netanyahu world said on background seems well coordinated? [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2370.24s)]
*  Yeah, I thought her comments were great and it conveyed a depth of empathy and actually caring [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2376.4799999999996s)]
*  about Palestinians in a way that people have been hungry to hear from an American leader of her [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2385.12s)]
*  stature. And look, the reality is she can't kind of totally separate herself from the policy of [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2392.9599999999996s)]
*  the administration that she's vice president in, but she can through her tone indicate what she [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2399.44s)]
*  feels and thinks about the issue. And that I think suggested going forward, she would be the kind of [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2404.88s)]
*  president that would put more prioritization on Palestinian suffering and on what she talked about, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2410.96s)]
*  Palestinian children, Palestinians who are going hungry. And so I think setting a new tone is [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2417.6s)]
*  really important and it does, I think, foreshadow an approach she's going to take. And that's why [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2423.44s)]
*  these goons and I'm sure, yeah, that probably is like Ron Dermer. First of all, let's just call [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2428.8799999999997s)]
*  that what it is. It's total bullshit. I mean, there's no ceasefire because Bibi Netanyahu keeps [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2433.2s)]
*  obstructing even his own negotiators. He can't even embrace the policy that has been put forward [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2437.3599999999997s)]
*  as an Israeli policy by Joe Biden. That's why there's no ceasefire. There's nothing to do with [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2442.7999999999997s)]
*  Kamala Harris. So I think she is doing the right thing. And the fact that they're responding like [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2448.48s)]
*  that, I think she can show strength by not kind of bowing to that kind of pressure. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2454.72s)]
*  The other thing I'd say about Trump, it is not anti-Semitic, contrary to what some people say, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2460.8799999999997s)]
*  to criticize the policies of the Israeli government. It is entirely anti-Semitic to [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2466.16s)]
*  suggest that American Jews live in a state of perpetual dual loyalty and somehow have to support [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2471.3599999999997s)]
*  blindly whoever the prime minister of Israel is. And that's basically what Trump is saying. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2479.7599999999998s)]
*  And I think the Jewish community in this country, the vast majority, is smart enough to know that. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2483.6s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. And on the record, comments were even worse. I mean, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2490.48s)]
*  as they sometimes are. It's about Ben Gavir, Smotris. They were just attacking her by name [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2496.4s)]
*  in tweets. That's how you know she did the right thing, right? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2503.44s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. But let's go to the situation on the ground and God's a Ben because again, [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2505.6s)]
*  it's a nightmare. So some updates from the last week or two. Israeli forces recovered the bodies [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2511.2s)]
*  of five hostages last week and the IDF continues to conduct military operations that are just [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2516.56s)]
*  constantly displacing civilians. So these people are just getting pushed around the Gaza Strip [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2523.2799999999997s)]
*  over and over again. Health officials say 100,000 Gazans may have hepatitis A and the Gaza Health [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2526.7999999999997s)]
*  Ministry declared a polio epidemic. By the way, then it's worth reading if listeners haven't. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2533.12s)]
*  Politico had a piece that was by two doctors who had recently been volunteering in Gaza. The [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2539.36s)]
*  headline was, We volunteered at a Gaza hospital. What we saw was unspeakable. And it's just this [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2545.76s)]
*  first person account of what they experienced and witnessed, which is just, it's worth reading. Just [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2551.1200000000003s)]
*  read it yourself. On Monday, Israeli military police said they're investigating the severe sexual [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2556.4s)]
*  abuse of a Palestinian prisoner at Settamon base in southern Israel. Nine military reservists [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2562.88s)]
*  are under suspicion after a prisoner was taken to the hospital with injuries so severe to his anus [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2569.28s)]
*  he was unable to walk. A far right mob, including members of the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2574.0s)]
*  broke into this base to protest those reservists potentially being disciplined, chanting, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2580.2400000000002s)]
*  we will not abandon our friends, certainly not for terrorists. Netanyahu condemned this break in, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2586.48s)]
*  but Itamar Ben-Gavir called the detention of the nine reservists, quote, nothing less than shameful. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2593.2000000000003s)]
*  Here's a clip from one of the protesters. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2599.04s)]
*  There was a member of the Knesset from Netanyahu's Likud party was at like some parliamentary [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2614.6400000000003s)]
*  meeting and he was asked by another MP if raping a detainee with a nightstick was legitimate. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2620.56s)]
*  And this guy replied, yes, if he's a member of Hamas, everything is legitimate. So I think that [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2627.2s)]
*  probably tells you everything you need to know about sort of sentiment around the treatment of [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2632.0s)]
*  Palestinians or Gazans at the moment. There was also a recent Washington Post piece that detailed [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2636.64s)]
*  the ways that there are these systemic problems across the Israeli penal system, overcrowding, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2641.7599999999998s)]
*  abuse, murder, torture. It's worth reading. So Ben, I guess I'm sort of like at a loss of what [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2648.08s)]
*  to ask about Gaza at this point. That said, I mean, a massive polio outbreak in the Gaza Strip [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2654.72s)]
*  will not remain there. Like that is the kind of thing that could spread across the entire [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2661.6s)]
*  Middle East if it's not contained. And there's no way to contain it when you have people living [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2666.16s)]
*  close together with no clean water. It's just, it's going to spread. Yeah, I think, you know, [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2671.3599999999997s)]
*  we have to realize that first of all, the death toll is probably far higher than what's been [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2677.2s)]
*  counted because of people under the rubble. Second of all, that, you know, the war is not [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2681.2s)]
*  going to end for the people of Gaza when there's a ceasefire. There are children who've lost their [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2687.04s)]
*  parents. There's children who've lost limbs, people who are deeply traumatized, and now people that [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2692.0s)]
*  are going to be getting all manner of diseases because of the conditions there. There are people [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2697.7599999999998s)]
*  that are malnutritioned. You know, so this is, you know, going to be a huge challenge for years and [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2702.08s)]
*  years to come. This is, I'm forewarning people, like, you know, when they declare a ceasefire, [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2708.8s)]
*  which they will at some point, you know, I assume, that that doesn't mean that this is over in any [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2714.88s)]
*  way, shape, or form. And I think the clip we played, you know, the dehumanization of Palestinians in [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2720.0s)]
*  Israeli society has gone on for so long that there's just something broken. That there are [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2727.84s)]
*  literally people protesting against what? Holding people accountable for sodomy. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2732.96s)]
*  Like, this is just, this is where dehumanization leads and it's not a, it's a very dark place. And [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2739.04s)]
*  so just as the Palestinian people are going to take a long time to repair, like, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2746.2400000000002s)]
*  Israeli society is going to have to repair itself. And that's going to be a generational project too. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2749.52s)]
*  Yeah. And that's really, really hard to do when you have leaders like Smotrich or Ben Gavir or Netanyahu [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2754.48s)]
*  who are leading people down the wrong path. A couple more things before we get to Ben's [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2760.0s)]
*  interview. So there's new reporting from the Guardian that claims evidence of boots on the [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2763.92s)]
*  ground from the United Arab Emirates in the ongoing civil war in Sudan. There was a 41-page [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2768.72s)]
*  document that reportedly got leaked to the Guardian in the UN Security Council that shows [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2773.68s)]
*  images of Emirati passports allegedly linked to the RSF forces that were discovered in the wreckage [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2778.4s)]
*  of an armored vehicle. The UAE is denying that these were like their intelligence guys [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2783.76s)]
*  instead saying they're a part of a humanitarian aid group. I do not buy it. I also think we've [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2790.24s)]
*  kind of lost count now with the number of smoking gun pieces of evidence linking the UAE to the RSF, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2795.6s)]
*  which are the rebel side of the civil war. There's the government versus the RSF forces. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2802.64s)]
*  Sudan continues to be one of the world's worst humanitarian catastrophes. According to U.S. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2808.7999999999997s)]
*  officials, it's estimated that up to 150,000 people have been killed and 10 million displaced [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2813.36s)]
*  have been killed. There have been widespread reports of rape, crimes against humanity, [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2820.0s)]
*  and aid organizations have been warning for months that the country is on the brink of famine. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2824.56s)]
*  So there are some glimmers of hope. There are ceasefire talks happening in Switzerland next [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2828.72s)]
*  month that have been arranged by the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. Hopefully, hopefully some kind of [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2833.7599999999998s)]
*  progress can be made there. But Ben, I guess I'm wondering, the more we read about the UAE's role [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2839.28s)]
*  in this, do you think there's any scenario where we get to a point where there's some [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2845.04s)]
*  sort of consequences, some sort of sanction for Emirati officials involved in arming or [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2849.84s)]
*  supporting these groups? Well, yeah, I think it speaks to the fact that, and we've said this [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2857.2s)]
*  before, but there's no way to solve this. Because, you know, even if you can't negotiate a total deal, [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2861.04s)]
*  you do want to just stop the fighting and get humanitarian access to these places. And that, [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2868.24s)]
*  at a minimum, is going to require bringing all these other countries that have been meddling, [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2872.32s)]
*  and principally the UAE is a supporter of the RSF, to just cut it out. They've got to stop [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2877.6000000000004s)]
*  doing this. Like, pouring more weapons in, or maybe even personnel, is manifestly making this worse. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2884.32s)]
*  And frankly, I find it kind of head scratching that why is this in the UAE's interest? [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2892.32s)]
*  If you're sitting on all that money, all that oil wealth, investing in all that technology, [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2897.44s)]
*  got Abu Dhabi in Dubai, like, why do you have to be down there? I'm sure they want to be buddies [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2901.52s)]
*  with the people that control all the oil in Sudan, which is a lot of oil. But this is not worth it. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2907.36s)]
*  And at a minimum, I think the US can be much, much more vocal about this. The way in which the UAE [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2913.84s)]
*  denies these things shows that they see the reputational cost of being associated with this. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2918.72s)]
*  I mean, I think you can ratchet up the messaging on this at a minimum. And then, obviously, like [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2924.24s)]
*  you say, even if it's not like economic sanctions, we sell all manner of arms to the UAE. There's [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2929.52s)]
*  ways to kind of put this in a bigger context. And the goal should just be trying to get everyone [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2936.64s)]
*  around the table to just stop this fighting and get humanitarian aid into places where there are [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2942.08s)]
*  desperate, desperate populations. And you want to enlist the UAE in that effort. And the Saudis [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2947.12s)]
*  being involved, I think, indicates a potential opening for that to happen. But in the meantime, [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2954.72s)]
*  you've got to keep the spotlight on this. Yeah, absolutely. And I'm glad there is some diplomacy, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2961.2799999999997s)]
*  but I think it needs to be more intensive. One other quick thing, CNN reported that as many [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2965.2799999999997s)]
*  as 80 members of the Wagner group, that Russian mercenary group we used to talk about all the time, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2970.8799999999997s)]
*  had been killed in Mali. These Wagner forces were reportedly killed in an ambush by a local rebel [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2976.3999999999996s)]
*  group and an al-Qaeda affiliate. I guess they worked together to go after them. Remember, [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2983.36s)]
*  the Wagner group has been backing the guys who took over Mali in a military coup back in 2021. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2990.32s)]
*  They've gained a lot of power in the region as they've driven French forces out of Africa. But, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=2996.56s)]
*  man, I mean, being a mercenary in this hell is a risky business. Yeah, I mean, first of all, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3002.48s)]
*  I, you know, we haven't checked in on the Wagner group in a while. I think I've talked to some [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3007.92s)]
*  pretty smart analysts who basically say what happened after Pergosian died in a plane crash, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3012.96s)]
*  wink, wink, accidentally in Russia. Tragic. Is that Wagner group's kind of been pulled into [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3019.44s)]
*  the Russian state apparatus. So instead of being this kind of, you know, one degree removed [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3024.48s)]
*  mercenary group, they're kind of more directly supervised by either the Kremlin or, you know, [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3028.96s)]
*  the state security apparatus. But then to lose 70 guys, that's like a big contingent. You know, [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3034.0s)]
*  they don't have like tens of thousands of forces down there. That is a massive blow to their [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3039.36s)]
*  manpower, literally on the ground there in places like Mali. It also speaks to the fact that like, [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3045.52s)]
*  there's a bit of a dog that caught the car circumstance here in that, like, okay, [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3052.16s)]
*  like, you know, you asked the French and the Americans from the Sahel where there really are [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3056.48s)]
*  security issues. Like real al-Qaeda affiliates. Yeah. Yeah. It's not like they, what do they [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3061.2s)]
*  win here? You know, they have such a zero sum mindset about global politics that everything [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3066.08s)]
*  is like a game of risk. And so if they can topple some governments that are democracies or aligned [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3071.7599999999998s)]
*  with France or the United States, like, that's just a win for them. But okay, now what? The Wagner [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3078.24s)]
*  group's gonna have to, someone's gonna have to be like patrolling the Sahel. Like, is that such an [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3082.72s)]
*  upside to them? I mean, that's what this points out to me is like, you know, I know what they, [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3087.68s)]
*  you know, the damage they've done in supporting these coups, but now we see like, well, the [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3093.04s)]
*  prizes, you get 70 Wagner group guys killed in Mali. Yeah. I mean, it's nothing compared to the [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3100.24s)]
*  losses that the Wagner group took in Ukraine, obviously, but those were lots of like, [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3106.3999999999996s)]
*  conscripted guys from prison. I mean, this seems like real fighters who were trained and equipped. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3111.52s)]
*  And it sounds like it might've wiped out all the Wagner group forces in Mali. And I guess, [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3116.88s)]
*  right, the old business model under pregotion was like, the Wagner group comes in, they kind of prop [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3121.04s)]
*  up some military junta government and they take control of like, I don't know, some sort of [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3125.6s)]
*  mineral mine or something like that. Like, I'm not sure how it works now under Russian leadership. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3130.4s)]
*  Well, and some of these are not even like resource rich countries too, you know, so it's like, they [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3135.04s)]
*  used to do this stuff in places like the DRC or, but, you know, yeah, this, it doesn't exactly seem [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3139.28s)]
*  like this is the A-Team, you know, fighting wise either. They, they suffered that kind of loss to [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3146.48s)]
*  some Turing rebels in Al-Qaeda, you know. Finally, let's have some fun. Let's talk about the 2024 [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3152.2400000000002s)]
*  Olympics in Paris. So we got badass athletes, we've got these great personal stories, we've got some [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3157.28s)]
*  manufactured outrage. There was also some sabotage, Ben, there was an attack on fiber optics cables [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3163.44s)]
*  that led to slower internet in some parts of Paris for a while. Before that, there was what was [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3169.2s)]
*  described as a coordinated arson attack on France's high city train network. Seems to have been [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3173.52s)]
*  blamed on some sort of far left group, but like, hopefully that's the extent of it. But back to the [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3178.16s)]
*  competition. What do you guys been watching in your house? Any favorite moments so far? [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3183.6s)]
*  We've been watching gymnastics. We are, I have to say, like, I mean Simone Biles, like my kids [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3188.16s)]
*  are obsessed with her. I'm a Sunni-Lee partisan, Lao American. I remember that from last time. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3195.04s)]
*  Yeah, well, because she's a Lao American, I got involved in Laos. She's great. So we've been watching [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3201.52s)]
*  that, loving that. Definitely like, you know, it's just on all day, right? And so like the swimming, [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3206.16s)]
*  we're into the swimmers, we're into, you know, that early phase of the Olympics. The opening [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3215.2s)]
*  ceremonies, my kids like the opening ceremonies, you know, they get the river, you got Lady Gaga, [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3220.32s)]
*  that was like, you know, a pleasant surprise. I was surprised that the French kind of Latin [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3226.88s)]
*  American takes such a prominent role in their opening ceremony, though, like that. I usually [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3230.7200000000003s)]
*  think of the French as kind of resisting American culture. It was nice to see Lady Gaga like pierce [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3234.7200000000003s)]
*  that. I will say for the world of content, even my kids, even my kids were like, Dad, how did they [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3238.32s)]
*  call South Korea, North Korea? Even my kids were like, who's in charge? Like, who could make that [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3247.44s)]
*  mistake? You know, I think then they South Sudan, they played the wrong national anthem. So like, [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3252.72s)]
*  these are pretty basic things. Like, and I was trying to explain my kids, it's not just like [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3257.92s)]
*  calling South Korea, like it by the wrong name. It's like their mortal enemy. It's a big deal. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3262.24s)]
*  It's like a big international incident. Yeah. Yeah, that's a big error. Yeah. I don't know. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3268.56s)]
*  If you haven't had a chance, you should try to find the end of the women's rugby batch [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3273.2799999999997s)]
*  from this morning. America won the bronze and it ended with like literally a 95 yard run [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3277.92s)]
*  for whatever they call a touchdown and rugby on like the last play of the game as time expired. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3285.44s)]
*  It was super badass. Yeah, we watched a lot of gymnastics too. Lizette's, you know, 19 months old. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3289.92s)]
*  So we're trying to get her into it and to stop demanding that we put on Miss Rachel instead. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3295.36s)]
*  We were watching some gymnastics and she just kept yelling fall down. So I don't know that she [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3300.08s)]
*  totally gets the concept yet. Swimming is a thing that's happening. I can't get into it really, [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3304.4s)]
*  but did you see the story about the Chinese swimmers who got busted for taking anabolic [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3310.56s)]
*  steroids and they said it was because they ate a hamburger? Yeah. And I was definitely like, [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3314.0s)]
*  you're never more like, I'm never like more patriotic than during the Olympics, you know? [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3319.12s)]
*  So I was like telling my kids that the Chinese swimmers had cheated and they're like, how come [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3323.44s)]
*  they get to cheat, you know? And like, but they're getting a bit of that like, you know, [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3327.36s)]
*  Olympics patriotism. I will also say, you know, you have a girl, I have two girls, like the Olympics [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3334.56s)]
*  are also like not only are the women's sports on kind of equal playing field as the men, like [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3341.6s)]
*  often like it's more interesting to watch the women's gymnastics swimming. So that's been cool too. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3346.2400000000002s)]
*  That's true in the winter games too, the ice skating. You mentioned this to the top. We also [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3351.52s)]
*  have a good old fashioned culture war breaking out because of the opening ceremony. So for those [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3355.84s)]
*  who missed it, the athletes, they traveled by boat down the Sen river in the pouring rain, [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3361.36s)]
*  they ended up the Eiffel tower. You had Gaga, you had Celine Dion performing and in the middle, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3365.84s)]
*  you basically got dropped into inside the mind of a French mime who dropped acid. There was like [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3371.6000000000004s)]
*  weird, lame is shit. There was a headless lady. There was this weird scene where like a blue man [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3378.48s)]
*  with a beard was lying on a platter in front of a bunch of other people. And that's the part that [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3384.56s)]
*  flipped out everybody on Fox news basically. So let's hear a clip of that. It was this moment [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3389.52s)]
*  from the ceremony that invoke the sacred Christian image of the last supper. See it there, [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3394.32s)]
*  but it featured drag queens and dancers standing in the place of Jesus and his apostles. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3400.88s)]
*  Now, some media outlets praise the drag display as a stunning and dazzling display of inclusivity. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3407.12s)]
*  And first lady, Jill Biden, will she love the opening ceremony? [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3413.92s)]
*  So last night was just I mean, it was spectacular. The rain did not dampen our spirits. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3418.5600000000004s)]
*  Every step of the way I was thinking to myself, oh my God, oh my God, how are we going to top [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3425.76s)]
*  this? How are we going to top this? How do you top mocking a religion on one of the largest [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3430.32s)]
*  world stages meant to unify the world behind sport and competition? There are 2.4 billion [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3437.84s)]
*  Christians in the world and the Olympics appears to have chosen mockery. Now let that sink in. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3444.4s)]
*  So that was Kayleigh McEnany, the former Trump press secretary turned Fox news person. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3450.1600000000003s)]
*  She's getting mad about the scene I described where there's that blue dude on a table. It was [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3456.96s)]
*  apparently an homage to Dionysus, the Greek God of having a good ass time. It was not the last [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3460.6400000000003s)]
*  supper. And then like she got mad about it. A bunch of like Elon Musk got mad for some reason. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3465.2s)]
*  I think Donald Trump Jr. did. Harrison Butker, the chief's kicker got all worked about it. I mean, [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3471.2s)]
*  guys, you're trying so hard to be pissed. Come on. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3477.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, there was a kind of cool queer vibe to the whole show. Like Paris is this dynamic [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3480.56s)]
*  envelope pushing place. What I hate about these people in these kinds of dust ups is that like, [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3489.12s)]
*  everybody likes Paris. This is part of Paris, right? It's always been people pushing the [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3497.12s)]
*  envelope. The headless Marie Antoinette, I thought that was super cool. There's some French heavy [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3502.96s)]
*  metal band playing with like the headed Marie Antoinette. They lost me as a French rapper. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3508.16s)]
*  I got to be honest with you. There were moments where I was like, how long is this? What is [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3513.92s)]
*  happening? It was awesome. And it was also the diversity of Paris was on display. Like they, [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3517.76s)]
*  they're black, brown and white people. Like, but this is you can't, you can't say you like Paris, [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3523.28s)]
*  which everybody says, and then say you don't like this part of it, because this is like the DNA of [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3529.36s)]
*  what makes that city so cool, you know, and so groundbreaking. So I thought it was great. And in [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3534.6400000000003s)]
*  fact, these people are triggered, like, get over yourself. So you know, so you don't agree with the [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3540.4s)]
*  pretensions of the French guy that planned the opening ceremonies, just just like someone, [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3545.92s)]
*  choose not to like others. Just leave us out of it. Yeah, change the channel. Also, like, you know, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3551.52s)]
*  if you're surprised that the French aren't embracing the, they were not criticizing The [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3556.4s)]
*  Last Supper. But if you're surprised that the French aren't embracing all parts of public [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3560.48s)]
*  Christianity, you might want to Google a little bit about French history and in customs. But yeah, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3564.96s)]
*  I mean, mostly like, shut the fuck up. This was days ago. Why are you people still whining about [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3569.84s)]
*  this? Just watch watch people do flips. Can we just have the Olympics and feel good about it? [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3573.36s)]
*  Have a good time. Have a good time. Okay, we're gonna take a quick break and we come back, [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3577.28s)]
*  you will hear Ben's interview with Philip Gunson about all the things happening down [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3581.1200000000003s)]
*  in Venezuela after their election. So stay tuned for that. Okay, as we've talked about Venezuela has [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3584.96s)]
*  erupted in protest after Nicolas Maduro claimed victory, dubious Lee claimed victory, we believe [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3589.84s)]
*  in this Sunday's election, claiming to win 51% of the vote despite polls and lead up showing more [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3596.7200000000003s)]
*  than double that support for the opposition. We are very pleased to be joined from Caracas by [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3601.6s)]
*  Philip Gunson, who's the Andes Project Director at the International Crisis Group. Thanks for joining [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3607.04s)]
*  us. You're very welcome. Thank you. I want to just kind of give a basic update for people, [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3611.04s)]
*  including people who might not have been following this that closely. But before we get into the [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3615.68s)]
*  politics, just what is the environment like there now on the ground? What can you tell us about [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3620.4s)]
*  what the days have been like since the election? What the protests are like? How big they are? [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3626.3199999999997s)]
*  Today, as we speak, it's fairly quiet. There is, there are, I should say, peaceful demonstrations, [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3630.56s)]
*  opposition demonstrations going on in different parts of the country that Maria Corina Machao, [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3635.92s)]
*  the opposition leader, called for yesterday. Yesterday, of course, was a lot more tense. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3640.3199999999997s)]
*  There were big demonstrations on the streets, not just here in Caracas, but in different towns [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3646.08s)]
*  and cities around Venezuela. And interestingly, they're quite different from the sorts of mass [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3652.7999999999997s)]
*  demonstrations that we've seen in previous years because of the class composition of them. I mean, [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3658.8s)]
*  these are demonstrators who were coming from the poor barrios here in Caracas. There are masses of [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3664.32s)]
*  people just surged onto the streets, clearly very angry. Spontaneously, this was not politically [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3669.84s)]
*  organized. And of course, they were fairly violently put down. But it's interesting because [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3675.1200000000003s)]
*  it marks a new phase. In the past, we've seen for months at a time on occasions, very big rallies [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3682.72s)]
*  in cities put down with tear gas and plastic bullets by National Guard, National Police. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3690.72s)]
*  But the composition of those demonstrations has been fairly solidly middle class. And the barrios [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3696.8799999999997s)]
*  have not really risen up in protest against the government. So this is new and it presents a new [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3703.3599999999997s)]
*  challenge for Maduro and the people around him. In terms of the election itself, we mentioned that [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3709.28s)]
*  Maduro's claimed victory with a little over 50% of the vote. The opposition says that they have [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3716.16s)]
*  proved that they secured some 70% of the vote. Just practically speaking, what happens now? Is [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3721.76s)]
*  there any process to adjudicate this? Or is it just a test of strength in the streets and in the [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3729.44s)]
*  institutions going forward? There are processes. I mean, election law and regulations provide for [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3736.48s)]
*  challenges to election results. But in Venezuela, there are no neutral arbiters. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3744.88s)]
*  All the relevant institutions are in the hands of the government. The electoral authority [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3750.8s)]
*  is controlled by the government. The Supreme Court is controlled by the government, the public [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3754.88s)]
*  prosecutor's office, and so on. Even the Ombudsman is basically just a government loyalist. So there [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3758.88s)]
*  isn't anywhere to go, except to the court of public opinion. What the opposition has done [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3765.68s)]
*  is that it's taken advantage of an interesting aspect of the Venezuelan electoral system. This [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3770.72s)]
*  is an electronic voting system, but it does produce a paper trail too. Each person, when they vote, [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3776.8799999999997s)]
*  receives a little piece of paper that tells them what their vote was. And that is put into [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3783.9199999999996s)]
*  something similar to an old fashioned box with a slot in it. The problem is the government clearly [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3789.04s)]
*  didn't want the result checked. So for one thing, very strenuous efforts were made to stop opposition [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3796.88s)]
*  witnesses and polling station workers from getting hold of those paper tallies, I should say. So [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3803.44s)]
*  what the opposition is left with right now is they managed to get hold, they say, of over 73% of the [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3810.32s)]
*  vote tallies. And they have since loaded those onto what they call a robust and bulletproof [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3816.64s)]
*  website, where those results, in theory at least, are available for anybody to check if they [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3822.8799999999997s)]
*  insert a Venezuelan, the number of a Venezuelan ID card or the name or location of a polling station. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3829.44s)]
*  The government, of course, has blocked that and blocked access to it. But that is what the [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3837.04s)]
*  international community, as well as the Venezuelan opposition, are calling for. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3842.56s)]
*  I'm going to say the international community. I mean, predominantly, of course, Western countries, [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3846.08s)]
*  the United States, Venezuela's Latin American neighbors, the European Union, and multilaterals [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3849.76s)]
*  and human rights organizations are saying, very simple, if you say to the government, if you say [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3856.8s)]
*  Maduro won, it's very easy. You have the means to produce the proof that this happened. So as to [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3862.72s)]
*  what happens now, of course, that's the big open question. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3869.84s)]
*  Maduro's been in power since 2013, successor to Hugo Chavez, lacking his charisma and [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3873.6800000000003s)]
*  his timing in some ways in terms of oral wealth. But he's weathered a lot. He's weathered sanctions, [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3882.88s)]
*  he's weathered economic shocks, he's weathered the international community you described, [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3891.76s)]
*  much of it recognizing a different figure as president for a period of time. In part, [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3897.44s)]
*  drawing on his own kind of stubbornness and some institutional support in the military and other [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3903.92s)]
*  places, but also drawing on support from Russia and China. But the opposition is probably less [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3909.12s)]
*  well known to folks. Maria Carina Machado and Eduardo Gonzalez have been the leaders. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3915.44s)]
*  You mentioned something interesting, which is the opposition in the past had drawn a lot of [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3922.56s)]
*  support from the middle class, but you referenced support from some of the poorer districts. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3927.12s)]
*  How would you just describe to people who haven't followed this closely who the opposition is right [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3934.96s)]
*  now and what their strategy is? I guess their near term strategy is to delegitimize Maduro's [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3938.24s)]
*  claim of victory. But beyond that, what do you see their strategy as? [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3944.08s)]
*  Yeah, who the opposition is a complicated question to answer. In fact, we tried in Crisis Group to [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3948.56s)]
*  come up with some graphic that would explain who they are and how they relate to another, [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3953.36s)]
*  and we failed. I mean, it's extremely complicated because on the ballot on Sunday, there were [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3958.08s)]
*  ten candidates, including Maduro and Gonzalez. A lot of the other candidates who basically, [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3963.84s)]
*  you know, made no impression whatsoever. I mean, their percentage support is within the range of [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3970.08s)]
*  statistical error. So these were not major candidates, but most of them claim to be opposition. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3976.08s)]
*  All of them claim to be opposition in one way or another. But a lot of them are really kind of fake [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3982.72s)]
*  opposition. They're just opposition parties and figures that are, you know, subsidized by the [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3986.72s)]
*  government, promoted by the government, not to divide the real opposition, confuse voters and so [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3993.6s)]
*  on. This was really a two horse race between Eduardo Gonzalez, who is not a professional [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=3999.12s)]
*  politician. He's a retired diplomat, 74 years old, never fought a political campaign in his life [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4004.3999999999996s)]
*  until now. He's always been a kind of backroom boy since he retired in terms of his role within [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4009.76s)]
*  the opposition as an advisor on international relations. But at a relevant time, when, you know, [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4015.76s)]
*  my dear Corina Machado, who had emerged from the opposition primary back in October with a massive [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4021.5200000000004s)]
*  victory, she won 93% of the vote, over 2 million votes cast for her in the primary, this was [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4027.0400000000004s)]
*  clearly the most popular figure in the opposition. And I'll come to her in a minute. But she was [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4032.48s)]
*  banned by the government. The government said, no way you're going to register your candidacy. You're [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4039.04s)]
*  too radical. You've called for foreign intervention in the past and so on. And we're not going to let [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4045.7599999999998s)]
*  you start. So my dear Corina was barred. She for a long time said, I'm the candidate and that's that. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4050.48s)]
*  You know, but then towards the end of the process, when the candidacies had to get registered back [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4057.12s)]
*  in March, she and the parties came ultimately after a lot of debate, a lot of discussion, [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4062.96s)]
*  to a consensus around the figure of Edmundo Gonzalez and miraculously managed to persuade [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4070.64s)]
*  the government to allow them to register his candidacy. But who's Maria Corina Machado? Well, [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4077.04s)]
*  she has been rather a lone wolf in the sense in opposition circles since she went into politics [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4081.36s)]
*  formally. I mean, she's been quite popular, but in terms of her ability to translate popularity into [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4089.12s)]
*  actual support for a candidacy, that hadn't happened until now. But so what made the [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4095.8399999999997s)]
*  difference? What really made the difference was that the opposition coalition has always been [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4101.76s)]
*  divided between, roughly speaking, moderates and radicals. The moderates are those who believe in [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4108.16s)]
*  electoral participation and in negotiations. And the radicals say, this is a dictatorship, [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4113.599999999999s)]
*  there's no point standing for election. Manuela is never going to negotiate his exit. The only [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4118.88s)]
*  language they understand is the language of power. So put people on the streets, call for foreign [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4123.6s)]
*  intervention and so on. They've swung between those two, the opposition coalition has swung between [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4129.68s)]
*  those two extremes. Maria Corina had always been critical of both sides. So by the time we get to [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4135.68s)]
*  the primaries at the end of last year, she's really the only opposition figure still standing [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4141.68s)]
*  with any kind of credibility. And she is feisty and she is a good public speaker and she's been [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4146.08s)]
*  intransigent. And people saw her, despite her political ban, as being the only figure really [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4152.72s)]
*  offering a chance for change. So Maduro's scandal was the opposition won't come together because [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4161.28s)]
*  we banned her. So that was Maduro's calculation. And as we've seen, it failed. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4168.72s)]
*  Maduro's obviously cast himself as a leftist. In the past, particularly in the origins of [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4174.0s)]
*  the Chavez movement, there was kind of this left-right divide. The opposition tended to be [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4181.360000000001s)]
*  politically to the right. Would you still characterize it that way? Or is this kind of [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4185.76s)]
*  a big tent over people who are just fed up with autocracy? Or is there still that kind of left-right [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4189.6s)]
*  divide in the society? It's always been a bit of a false argument to suggest that this is [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4195.120000000001s)]
*  an ideological struggle. I mean, the problem here- That's what Maduro wants it to be, right? [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4203.6s)]
*  He wants to frame it that way. Well, that's right. Maduro claims that opposition to him is basically [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4208.88s)]
*  all orchestrated from abroad and it's a right-wing plot and they just simply want to overthrow him [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4213.92s)]
*  because he's the man of the people, he's the worker president and so on. And the right can't [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4218.96s)]
*  stand that their privileges have been taken away. There was some validity to that argument when [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4224.4800000000005s)]
*  Chavez first took power. The problem is, I mean, you know, Chavez of course came to power [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4232.16s)]
*  democratically. He was elected democratically by a large majority in 1998. But in power, he, [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4236.5599999999995s)]
*  you know, as autocratic leaders tend to do, even those elected democratically, [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4244.08s)]
*  started to dismantle all the checks and balances, even those checks and balances provided for in [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4248.24s)]
*  the 1999 constitution, which he introduced via a constituent assembly, which was dominated by [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4253.28s)]
*  his supporters. But those kinds of, you know, checks and balances, the separation of powers, [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4259.84s)]
*  any kind of free press and anything really that would constitute a check on his power was very, [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4266.64s)]
*  you know, very irritating to him. And he set about trying to dismantle it. And in 2007, he tried [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4273.12s)]
*  actually to formally change the constitution that he brought in as recently as 1999 in order to make [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4278.4800000000005s)]
*  it more autocratic and more, as he would put it, socialist. But if we fast forward, I mean, [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4284.88s)]
*  the opposition coalition, because it's increasingly become an issue of, you know, democracy against [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4291.92s)]
*  autocracy, the opposition coalition is a very big tent. It's a very broad coalition that has people [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4299.12s)]
*  in it on the, really literally on the far left and the quite conservative right. And the [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4305.2s)]
*  issue here and the reason why Chavismo, the movement that Chavez created, ruling in the [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4315.52s)]
*  ruling socialist party, have lost an enormous amount of support in the areas, in the barriers [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4322.88s)]
*  and in rural areas where obviously the poorer parts of the country where they bought into this [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4329.28s)]
*  idea that, you know, socialism, Chavez's version of socialism was going to be great for them because [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4336.4800000000005s)]
*  it meant handouts and it meant, you know, big welfare programs. And while the oil price was high, [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4341.6s)]
*  that was good. But under Maduro, of course, the economy has literally [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4347.120000000001s)]
*  crashed. I mean, it's gone. It's lost 75 to 80% of GDP over the time that Maduro has been in power, [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4351.280000000001s)]
*  because not only had Chavez spent all the money in typical populist fashion, but the oil price [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4359.200000000001s)]
*  collapsed very soon after Maduro came to power. And he refused to reform the economy for several [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4365.12s)]
*  years, maintained this very much, you know, top down economy, command economy with price controls, [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4371.84s)]
*  exchange controls, which is just destroying private business. And all the publicly run [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4378.5599999999995s)]
*  enterprises that Chavez had mainly expropriated or set up were not just not making money, they were [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4384.96s)]
*  hemorrhaging money terribly. So poverty became rampant. And by 2015, just two years after [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4392.16s)]
*  Maduro came to power, there was already a severe humanitarian crisis in Venezuela. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4400.88s)]
*  So to come back to your point about ideology, I mean, this is really not about left right. I mean, [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4407.28s)]
*  it's unfortunate that Maria Corina, who is on the political right, you know, starts herself up, [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4414.4s)]
*  you know, an economic liberal and is quite socially conservative, [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4419.12s)]
*  and talks about burying socialism. You know, she's the most prominent opposition leader, [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4423.28s)]
*  but she's not representative, I don't think really of the broader opposition. And I don't [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4427.5199999999995s)]
*  think that support for her is based primarily on her kind of right wing stance. It's primarily [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4432.96s)]
*  based on people's desperate need for change and the idea that she is the one who can deliver. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4439.68s)]
*  And so one last question here that has been such a useful deep dive into what's happening inside [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4446.32s)]
*  Venezuela. Obviously, external parties, including the United States and Venezuela's neighbors, [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4451.6s)]
*  you know, are watching this closely. The Biden administration, I think in a smart shift from [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4457.5199999999995s)]
*  kind of the maximum pressure sanctions forward policy of the Trump administration, [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4464.88s)]
*  had kind of helped broker this election taking place in exchange for the relaxation of some [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4469.6s)]
*  sanctions. It's tried to hold together a coalition of neighbors, including Colombia, [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4475.52s)]
*  which has enormous, I mean, there are 8 million Venezuelans outside of the country now, many of [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4481.52s)]
*  them millions in Colombia and neighboring countries, a lot in the United States. So there are, you know, [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4486.240000000001s)]
*  serious consequences for the hemisphere as well. What are the options available to policymakers, [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4492.56s)]
*  you know, in the US here? You know, sanctions haven't worked really in dislodging Maduro. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4499.68s)]
*  They seem to have worked in helping get an election, but not in getting him to buy by [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4506.0s)]
*  the results of the election so far. What do you see as the conversations in Washington and Bogota [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4510.400000000001s)]
*  and other important capitals in the days ahead? Yes, I mean, I agree with you. I mean, I think [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4516.320000000001s)]
*  the Biden administration has taken an intelligent approach to this. They've tried to use the sanctions [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4521.84s)]
*  regime that they inherited from Donald Trump to produce change by saying to Maduro, look, [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4527.36s)]
*  we're perfectly prepared to dismantle sanctions, but we need to see from you, you know, a return [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4532.719999999999s)]
*  to democracy or at least significant advances in that direction. I think you have to acknowledge [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4537.5199999999995s)]
*  that although you could say that this hasn't worked in the sense that, as you say, Maduro [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4543.12s)]
*  has not respected the results of this election, we wouldn't even be in this situation if it hadn't [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4550.0s)]
*  been for that insistence by the Biden administration. People will remember, [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4555.52s)]
*  perhaps, that back in October, the opposition and the government of Maduro signed what are known as [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4561.4400000000005s)]
*  the Barbados agreements, which in theory, you know, guaranteed a basic minimum of conditions for the [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4567.280000000001s)]
*  2024 election, conditions which the government then proceeded to violate. But at the same time, [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4575.76s)]
*  I think if it hadn't been for that, then the candidacy of Edmundo Gonzalez would probably [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4580.88s)]
*  never have been registered. And we wouldn't be in a position today to say that he actually appears [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4586.16s)]
*  to have won the election and Maduro stole it. And this takes us into a different dimension. Now, [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4591.76s)]
*  what exactly is going to be possible to do from here on is, you know, a huge question. Maduro is [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4597.2s)]
*  digging himself ever deeper as we speak. He's accusing the opposition of conspiring, [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4603.28s)]
*  checking the election system, of causing the demonstrations yesterday, [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4608.24s)]
*  which I don't think was the case at all. And so right now, there doesn't seem to be much of a [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4615.12s)]
*  path forward in terms of returning to negotiations. Now, that said, the US, Colombia, and Brazil, [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4621.44s)]
*  who all are clearly extremely skeptical about the results, and have said so publicly, [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4628.639999999999s)]
*  have stopped short of saying they don't recognise them. And what they're saying instead is, well, [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4632.72s)]
*  go ahead, you know, show that you won. Give us the proper results. But, [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4638.72s)]
*  and I think that that's important in the sense that they're trying to keep the door open. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4644.5599999999995s)]
*  They all have, you know, lines into Maduro. And so it looks like where we're headed here is that [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4649.12s)]
*  those three countries and others that have said, we're waiting for the full results, will ultimately [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4654.8s)]
*  have to say, look, Maduro stole it. And Maduro is not a legitimate president. And his isolation will [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4660.48s)]
*  continue. The countries that have said outright, like Chile, for example, has said, this is not a [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4666.24s)]
*  credible result. And their diplomats have been expelled, along with many others, especially from [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4671.84s)]
*  countries in Latin America. The Venezuelan government has cut air links to Panama and the [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4679.76s)]
*  Dominican Republic, which are two of the main routes. It seems to me that, I mean, there are [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4685.44s)]
*  two points I'd make just to wind up. One is that there can't be any kind of transition back to some [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4689.92s)]
*  form of democratic rule, institutional rule, without full scale negotiations between the two [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4700.32s)]
*  sides. Because no opposition government obviously can take power without the green light from Maduro, [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4705.52s)]
*  who controls the military, the Supreme Court, and all the things we mentioned before. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4713.52s)]
*  It's impossible to govern this country against the will of Maduro and his allies. But likewise, [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4717.2s)]
*  the country looks pretty ungovernable right now by Chavismo, because they've lost most of their [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4725.599999999999s)]
*  support. That's one thing. And the other thing is that that kind of negotiation, it seems to me, [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4732.879999999999s)]
*  full scale negotiations you've never seen hitherto, can only take place [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4741.92s)]
*  in the aftermath or in the midst of a crisis of the kind that we're seeing right now. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4749.2s)]
*  Well, look, that's a great summary. Thanks so much for joining us. We'll keep our eye on this. And [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4754.4s)]
*  everybody should check out the reports that you've participated in for the International Crisis Group, [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4759.28s)]
*  just a tremendous organization that's helped us unpack a lot of crises around the world. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4765.84s)]
*  Thanks for joining us and we'll look forward to following your work. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4770.719999999999s)]
*  Thank you. It's been a pleasure. Thanks again to Philip Gunsa for joining the show. Ben, [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4773.679999999999s)]
*  thanks for clocking in from your vacation here. No, no problem. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4777.759999999999s)]
*  I'm off next week. You're off? [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4781.599999999999s)]
*  I'm off. I'm going to be with a lot of family and two little kids for the week, but excited to be [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4784.5599999999995s)]
*  back after that. You're going to be hot. We don't have to disclose your location. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4792.5599999999995s)]
*  I'll be someplace very sweaty. The climate is going to be an issue. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4796.4800000000005s)]
*  I'll sweat it out and survive, but I'll miss you guys. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4801.6s)]
*  It's the first time flying with two kids? [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4803.68s)]
*  First time flying with two of them. I'm absolutely terrified. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4805.4400000000005s)]
*  And then it's a long flight and then a multi-hour drive. So it seems like not the smartest. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4808.64s)]
*  Get some CVD or something. Something stronger. All right, buddy. See you soon. Travel safe. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMeBK2sAu98&t=4817.280000000001s)]
