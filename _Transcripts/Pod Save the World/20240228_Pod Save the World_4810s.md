Video Description: Ben Rhodes and Tommy Vietor discuss President Biden’s claim that a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas may be imminent, the domestic political problems the war is creating for Biden, the latest on efforts to defer attacks by Iran’s proxy groups in the Middle East, and some rare good news about Iran’s nuclear program. They also discuss the staggering casualty numbers from the war in Ukraine, claims that a prisoner exchange involving Alexei Navalny was in final stages before his death, new reports about extensive Russian efforts to interfere in our elections, right-wing autocratic creeps at CPAC, an investigation into the Mexican president’s ties with drug cartels, Saudi Arabia dumping money on celebrities and CEOs in Miami, and why Taylor Swift’s dad was throwing punches in Australia. Then Ben talks with Wai Wai Nu, a human rights activist and the founder of the Women’s Peace Network about the civil war in Myanmar.

*  I mean, that's one of the issues. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=49.56s)]
*  But the the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=51.36s)]
*  the other funny thing, Tommy, is we've all been there where [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=54.04s)]
*  you know, if you're a staffer and you mentioned something to the principal [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=57.040000000000006s)]
*  and then you're surprised, like because what Biden said was, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  well, my national security adviser, it sounded like he had just talked to like [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  Dr. Sullivan. It's like, well, my national security adviser just told me [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=66.04s)]
*  that there's a ceasefire. Yeah. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=69.08s)]

*  Well, we'll get everyone. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=73.16s)]
*  We'll get into more detail on all this in one second. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=74.60000000000001s)]
*  Today, we're going to cover the latest from Gaza and how this potential [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  ceasefire news and how the conflict is creating domestic political problems [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  for President Biden, even as Netanyahu keeps laying out policy [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=85.28s)]
*  visions that are seem like they're snubbing his nose at the US. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=89.52s)]
*  We're going to talk about the latest [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=93.24s)]
*  from the International Court of Justice in efforts to deter attacks [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=94.16s)]
*  from Iranian proxy groups in the Middle East. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=96.48s)]
*  The horrifying casualty count from the war in Ukraine. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=98.44s)]
*  The latest news about the murder by Russia of opposition leader [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=100.52s)]
*  Alexei Navalny, Russian interference into our elections. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=104.4s)]
*  CPAC gets real weird and goes kind of international. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=107.36s)]
*  Then we'll talk about that. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=110.76s)]
*  Some allegations against the president of Mexico. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=112.08s)]
*  The Saudis take Miami and then Taylor Swift [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  may be doing battle with Australia at the moment. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=117.04s)]
*  You heard about this? I have not. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  So I'm looking forward to it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  I like both Taylor Swift content and Australian content. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=121.28s)]
*  So it's our wheelhouse. I'm ready for it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=124.0s)]
*  And then, Ben, you just did our interview. What are we going to hear? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  So we haven't checked in on the situation in Myanmar in a while, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=128.36s)]
*  where it's been pretty astonishing. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=131.72s)]
*  The opposition forces is kind of patchwork of different groups [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=133.72s)]
*  fighting against the military junta that came to full power in a coup in 2021. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=137.28s)]
*  The opposition force has been gaining a lot of ground. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=143.39999999999998s)]
*  So I talked to Y.Y. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=145.6s)]
*  Niu, who's a very prominent activist for the Rohingya community, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=146.39999999999998s)]
*  which is the most persecuted of the communities in Myanmar. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=150.64s)]
*  And we basically didn't update on what's going on in the country. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=153.39999999999998s)]
*  What is the nature and ambition of the opposition? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=157.07999999999998s)]
*  What is the situation for the Rohingya? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=160.2s)]
*  We've obviously suffered a lot. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=162.23999999999998s)]
*  And what can the US and other countries do? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=163.23999999999998s)]
*  So it's kind of a check in on an issue that we probably should check in on more. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=165.44s)]
*  Yeah, important update. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=169.32s)]
*  And also, I know something like near and dear to your heart. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=170.2s)]
*  Yes. You went there when? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=172.24s)]
*  Twenty twenty one to before that. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=173.44000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I went pretty much every year starting in. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=176.16000000000003s)]
*  God, like 20. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=179.60000000000002s)]
*  I mean, the last trip. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=180.84s)]
*  Twenty. Yeah, it started going every year in about 2011. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=181.60000000000002s)]
*  The last time I was there was, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  I want to say probably 2018, actually. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=187.84s)]
*  OK, so all pre covid. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=189.60000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, pre covid travel. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=191.16000000000003s)]
*  Time has been flattened out for me. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=192.44s)]
*  Time is flat circle. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=194.04000000000002s)]
*  So I'd love to go back. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=194.84s)]
*  But, you know, that's on the cards for a little while. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=196.88000000000002s)]
*  Yes, could get rid of a junta. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=199.16000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I got to get rid of the junta and I'll go back. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=200.8s)]
*  Work on that one. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=202.68s)]
*  Work on that turn the break. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=204.0s)]
*  All right. Let's start with Gaza because there are some major updates. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  As you mentioned at the top, as we mentioned at the top, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=210.28s)]
*  President Biden sounded a hopeful note on prospects for a ceasefire, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=212.20000000000002s)]
*  both during an appearance on late night with Seth Meyers [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=216.16000000000003s)]
*  and then during this ice cream stop. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=218.32000000000002s)]
*  Listen to the interview first. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=219.88000000000002s)]
*  There is a path forward with difficulty, but here's the path forward. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=222.0s)]
*  Look, first of all, there are the hostages being held must be released. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=225.88000000000002s)]
*  And then we've got to and then some principle agreement. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=230.72s)]
*  There will be a ceasefire while that takes place. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=233.04s)]
*  Ramadan is coming up, and there's been an agreement by the Israelis [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=236.12s)]
*  that they would not engage in activities during Ramadan as well [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=239.04s)]
*  in order to give us time to get all the hostages out. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  That gives us time to begin to move in directions [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=247.12s)]
*  that a lot of Arab countries are prepared to move in. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=250.04s)]
*  For example, Saudi Arabia is ready to recognize Israel. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=253.04s)]
*  Jordan is Egypt. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=256.44s)]
*  There are six other states have been working with Qatar. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=259.24s)]
*  And so there's a process underway that I think if we get that [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=261.72s)]
*  that temporary ceasefire, we're going to be able to move in a direction [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=265.52000000000004s)]
*  where we can change the dynamic and not have a two state solution immediately, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=269.48s)]
*  but a process to get to a two state solution, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=275.24s)]
*  a process to guarantee Israel's security and the independence of the Palestinians. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=278.08000000000004s)]
*  But without them being able to, for example, invite invite in, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=283.56s)]
*  you know, another country to provide their defenses. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=287.91999999999996s)]
*  And then as we mentioned during that that ceasefire, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=290.64s)]
*  or as we mentioned during that ice cream, OTR, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=292.56s)]
*  he put Jake Sullivan on the hook to land this plane by by Monday. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=295.67999999999995s)]
*  So the specifics of the ceasefire that have been recorded are complicated. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=299.35999999999996s)]
*  The Times reported that the Israeli War Cabinet approved a six week [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=302.64s)]
*  truce for the release of 40 hostages. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=306.32s)]
*  This would also require Israel allowing much, much more aid into Gaza. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  There are also proposals to release a certain number of Palestinian [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=313.08s)]
*  prisoners being held by Israel for the release of every hostage. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=315.68s)]
*  There are certain like math equations for different types of people. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=320.16s)]
*  There's like a certain number of Palestinian prisoners [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=323.04s)]
*  for every female hostage being held. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=325.32s)]
*  There's another number for the release of civilian men over a certain age. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=327.16s)]
*  And this is where the politics, I think, for Netanyahu get complicated, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=332.16s)]
*  because Hamas is demanding people in prison who are convicted of murder [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=335.4s)]
*  or people who are assessed to have been a part of terrorist attacks. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=340.4s)]
*  So this is where you could see Netanyahu's coalition [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=344.12s)]
*  try to pull the plug on any ceasefire deal and make it harder for him. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=347.6s)]
*  So that's why I think we're all kind of nervously watching this. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=350.48s)]
*  On Monday, Netanyahu said he proposed a plan to his war cabinet [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=353.88s)]
*  to evacuate civilians from Ra'afah, the city in southern Gaza, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=356.8s)]
*  where an estimated 1.4 million Gazans are currently sheltering. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=359.64s)]
*  That would be done in advance of a major military operation [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=362.56s)]
*  that everyone but Netanyahu seems to think would be catastrophic. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=365.76s)]
*  So, Ben, negotiators are meeting this week in Qatar. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=369.08s)]
*  They're racing to get the ceasefire deal done before Ramadan starts on March 10th. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=373.24s)]
*  How hopeful are you feeling? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=377.36s)]
*  I mean, it's interesting that President Biden would kind of preview it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=379.28000000000003s)]
*  It makes me think he's pretty hopeful. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=382.28000000000003s)]
*  I think so. And look, I do think that [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=384.72s)]
*  it's not the main point here, but probably don't do this with the ice cream cone, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=388.76000000000005s)]
*  given, you know, the gravity of the circumstances. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=393.08000000000004s)]
*  But I think you made a good summary. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=396.64000000000004s)]
*  It's pretty clear what the administration's plan is, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=398.68s)]
*  which is try to get a ceasefire, get as many hostages out in the ceasefire [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=400.72s)]
*  as you can, make the ceasefire so long that it becomes harder for Israel [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=403.92s)]
*  to resume its military operation on the back end of the ceasefire [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=407.52s)]
*  and then use this time of the ceasefire to get some diplomatic process [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=410.24s)]
*  going with the Saudis and other Arab countries, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=414.8s)]
*  both around some Gaza plan [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=418.16s)]
*  and around the pursuit of a Palestinian state in exchange [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=421.52s)]
*  for normalization of Israel. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=425.04s)]
*  That's clearly been the play that the administration has in mind for some time. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=426.24s)]
*  I was a little struck by the optimism. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=430.92s)]
*  I mean, if they'd land that plane, you know, that would be [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=434.40000000000003s)]
*  significant progress from where we are. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=438.52s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=439.88s)]
*  From the Israeli side, like you said, I'm sure there are elements of the right wing [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=442.12s)]
*  coalition that Nanyahu has that don't want to release Palestinian prisoners. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=445.76s)]
*  They don't want to let in a lot of aid. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=448.88s)]
*  They don't want to not go into RAFA. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=450.92s)]
*  And so there's a Israel piece of this that remains in question. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=454.6s)]
*  And then on the Hamas side, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=457.4s)]
*  Hamas has actually kind of poured some cold water on this, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=459.03999999999996s)]
*  and they may be trying to leverage the negotiation [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=461.59999999999997s)]
*  to get out as many prisoners as they can. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=464.76s)]
*  So we'll see if Hamas is truly committed to it. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=467.0s)]
*  I wonder about this Arab piece [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=469.44s)]
*  because I just you know, the two things that I'd raise are, first of all. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=473.0s)]
*  Who's in Gaza? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=480.12s)]
*  Like, you know, I think that the preferred option would be that there's some Arab [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=481.0s)]
*  kind of peacekeeping force that is helping to secure Gaza while reconstruction proceeds. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=485.76s)]
*  And yet Israel has not agreed to that at all. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=492.08s)]
*  Israel has kind of suggested that they want to have this kind of de facto control over Gaza. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=493.72s)]
*  And then also, I do wonder, I mean, obviously, we've seen with the Abraham Accords, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=497.52s)]
*  Gulf Arab states in particular, be willing to take this step toward normalization. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=502.72s)]
*  It strikes me as a pretty big risk for new Arab states like Saudi Arabia [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=506.48s)]
*  to kind of normalize relations with Israel right in the wake of killing 30,000 Palestinians. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=513.04s)]
*  So I just I don't know. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=520.28s)]
*  I mean, if that all comes together, that would be quite remarkable. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=521.56s)]
*  It does feel like there's a lot of different pieces of this [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=527.28s)]
*  that have to fit in the puzzle board here at a time when the humanitarian [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=530.5999999999999s)]
*  circumstances in Gaza is as bad as it's ever been. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=534.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, to that point, I mean, the Egyptians and the Jordanians [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=536.64s)]
*  have been air dropping aid. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=539.64s)]
*  I saw that UNRWA, the UN organization that's able to operate on the ground in Gaza, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=541.56s)]
*  said the last time they were able to deliver food aid to northern Gaza was January 23rd. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=545.96s)]
*  So over a month ago. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=551.28s)]
*  So people in northern Gaza are just starving to death. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=552.1999999999999s)]
*  In in in general, the average number of trucks getting into Gaza is something [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=554.24s)]
*  like 50 to 60 trucks, not 200 like the Israelis promised. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=558.48s)]
*  So it's way under. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=561.52s)]
*  And UN officials are saying that these aid deliveries have been severely hampered [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=562.84s)]
*  because there were Israeli airstrikes on the police officers who are guarding [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=566.96s)]
*  these convoys and now they're not operating and supporting these aid [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=571.16s)]
*  deliveries anymore. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=575.0799999999999s)]
*  So the convoys are getting attacked by people who are desperate or criminal [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=575.88s)]
*  elements who are trying to get the stuff and sell it. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=578.9599999999999s)]
*  So it's an incredibly dire situation. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=581.6s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like we've reached the tipping point that people have been [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=583.48s)]
*  warning about for some time of just people not having enough food, not having [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=586.92s)]
*  enough water, there not being any hospital infrastructure left and there [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=592.52s)]
*  being the beginnings of the spread of disease as people don't have clean water [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=597.28s)]
*  and don't have any sanitation. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=602.96s)]
*  And frankly, this kind of effort to kind of starve UNRWA is a part of that [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=605.5600000000001s)]
*  picture as well. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=612.36s)]
*  And so one of the many reasons to try to get a ceasefire is it does feel like [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=613.2s)]
*  absent that in a major change in the dynamic of getting assistance in, there [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=619.16s)]
*  could be this kind of exponential spiral, the humanitarian crisis. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=624.3199999999999s)]
*  And that has to be front of mind for everybody, I think, because it's obvious [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=628.6s)]
*  to anybody following this that we've reached that point. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=634.48s)]
*  And it's no longer a warning about some future risk of all these different [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=636.8399999999999s)]
*  factors that's happening now. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=640.8399999999999s)]
*  We're there. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=641.88s)]
*  So President Biden is obviously feeling some serious political pressure to get [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=642.52s)]
*  a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=646.48s)]
*  We're taping this on Tuesday, February 27th. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=647.56s)]
*  Right now, Michigan voters are going to the polls. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=650.52s)]
*  There's this broad effort to get people to vote uncommitted instead of for Biden [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=652.92s)]
*  in an effort to show to be a protest vote to the administration's Gaza policy. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=656.56s)]
*  Organizers say their target is to get 10,000 uncommitted votes. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=661.12s)]
*  But it's worth noting that uncommitted got about 11 percent of the vote during [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=665.2s)]
*  the Obama 2012 re-elect, which was about 20,000 votes. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=669.4399999999999s)]
*  I wonder what we did. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=673.0s)]
*  I did. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=673.8s)]
*  You know, I don't know. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=674.8s)]
*  I don't remember why that happened. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=675.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know either. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=676.6s)]
*  Maybe it was kind of like Mitt Romney. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=677.92s)]
*  I think there's just like a large uncommitted vote often in Michigan. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=679.2s)]
*  But look, I don't know. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=682.24s)]
*  There will be numbers out by the time people are listening to this. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=684.96s)]
*  But it was just interesting to see the expectations setting so low. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=687.08s)]
*  Maybe that's just smart politics or maybe there's something else going on. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=689.6s)]
*  Also, in terms of domestic news, on Sunday, a senior airman in the U.S. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=694.44s)]
*  Air Force named Aaron Bushnell lit himself on fire in front of the Israeli [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=698.8s)]
*  embassy in Washington to protest the war. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=702.5600000000001s)]
*  Beforehand, he posted a video saying he didn't want to be complicit in genocide. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=704.8s)]
*  And he shouted free Palestine as he burned and later died at the hospital. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=708.5600000000001s)]
*  It was just a horrible scene there. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=712.12s)]
*  Earlier today, Netanyahu released a video pushing back on Biden's [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=714.1999999999999s)]
*  obviously true statement from that NBC interview we just heard that Israel [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=718.12s)]
*  is losing international support for the war. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=722.4s)]
*  Netanyahu claimed that he's been leading an effort aimed at, quote, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=724.8s)]
*  countering international pressure to end the war ahead of time [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=727.4399999999999s)]
*  and mobilize support for Israel. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=730.3199999999999s)]
*  Not sure that has been successful. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=732.24s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=734.16s)]
*  Yeah, no idea. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=735.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=736.5999999999999s)]
*  Also, Netanyahu released a plan for postwar Gaza that included [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=737.3199999999999s)]
*  Israel retaining indefinite military control over Gaza while allowing [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=740.16s)]
*  Gazans without links to Hamas to act as civilian administrators. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=744.36s)]
*  But it seemed like that language is framed to say the Palestinian [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=748.0s)]
*  authority could not be in charge. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=751.12s)]
*  And then today, then I saw that the prime minister of the Palestinian [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=752.4399999999999s)]
*  authority resigned, but not President Abbas, which was sort of an [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=755.16s)]
*  interesting shakeup in there. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=758.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of pieces moving around here. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=760.68s)]
*  I mean, in the domestic politics space, we'll see what happens [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=762.88s)]
*  at the uncommitted vote. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=765.8s)]
*  I mean, it's also the question of, you know, there have been reports [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=766.7199999999999s)]
*  that, you know, it's hard to get surrogates to go to Michigan [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=770.04s)]
*  because they're going to get protested, you know? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=773.0799999999999s)]
*  And so it's not just the vote share. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=774.8399999999999s)]
*  It's also like the enthusiasm. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=777.2399999999999s)]
*  A lot of the people that are sitting it out are the kind of people [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=779.4799999999999s)]
*  that might have been organizers for Democrats. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=781.8s)]
*  But also, like, can you go to college campuses and can you go [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=784.04s)]
*  to communities like Dearborn and just show up when people are this angry? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=786.64s)]
*  So that bears watching as well as the uncommitted count. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=791.4s)]
*  I think the Gaza piece that you mentioned, again, the two big [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=794.64s)]
*  outstanding gaps beyond the conduct of the war are this question of, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=797.76s)]
*  like, who administers Gaza? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=802.64s)]
*  And is there some recognition of a Palestinian state or some [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=804.1999999999999s)]
*  at least aspirational recognition of a Palestinian state? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=808.6s)]
*  And again, it just bears repeating in both those questions. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=811.3199999999999s)]
*  Israel's way out of step with not just the U.S., but just about everybody else. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=813.8399999999999s)]
*  And that that speaks to whether or not this deal can endure. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=817.68s)]
*  So let's say they get the deal. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=822.0s)]
*  Whether or not that deal leads somewhere kind of depends on those two questions. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=824.0s)]
*  Gaza administration and Palestinian state. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=827.5600000000001s)]
*  And the thing about the Palestinian authority, it seems like, you know, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=830.4000000000001s)]
*  the U.S. and other countries are probably pressing for some reform. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=833.1600000000001s)]
*  And so you get some resignations and you get some new technocrats in there [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=837.0s)]
*  or something, but it's got to be more than that. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=840.2800000000001s)]
*  For the sake of the Palestinians, you know, the there has to be this kind of bottom [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=844.32s)]
*  up, you know, investment in meaningful leadership that is close to the community. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=847.8399999999999s)]
*  You know, the problem is not the caliber of the technocrat, although, you know, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=854.04s)]
*  you can always try to tinker with that. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=857.64s)]
*  It's about the legitimacy. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=859.68s)]
*  Is this kind of old man, Mahmoud Abbas, sitting in Ramallah and the people around him, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=861.4399999999999s)]
*  does he kind of connect down to civil society, to young people? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=866.16s)]
*  It's a very young population. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=869.52s)]
*  So I'd like to see that effort not just focus on, like, who are the ministers in the PA? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=870.92s)]
*  But can you take resources and direct it to people that have real credibility in these [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=875.4399999999999s)]
*  communities? Yeah. And the PA is completely broke. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=878.52s)]
*  And that's going to be an enormous challenge for reconstruction. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=881.36s)]
*  Also, Bibi Netanyahu's plan that he laid out for postwar Gaza says that Israel is going [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=883.64s)]
*  to take control of a sliver of territory in Gaza along the border to provide as a buffer [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=888.16s)]
*  zone and prevent another October 7th. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=892.4399999999999s)]
*  That is incredibly controversial. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=894.24s)]
*  The plan does not stipulate whether or not Israeli settlers will be allowed to return [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=896.1999999999999s)]
*  to Gaza, which is a pretty big, big omission. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=900.16s)]
*  Yeah. It calls for the dismantling of UNRWA, the only UN agency operating in Gaza. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=903.0s)]
*  And UNRWA, by the way, they said that they have lost four hundred and fifty million [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=907.88s)]
*  dollars in donor funding since Israel accused 12 UNRWA employees of participating in the [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=912.0400000000001s)]
*  October 7th attacks and they will be out of money by March. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=916.52s)]
*  So just like desperation for every aid organization. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=921.0s)]
*  We've talked about this. So but I what is achieved by that? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=924.0s)]
*  You know, there's not some other entity that can perform these services. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=928.64s)]
*  As we talked about, there's tens of thousands of people that are associated with UNRWA [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=932.76s)]
*  because they perform all these various services. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=936.64s)]
*  I just think it's the wrong way of going about it. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=940.0s)]
*  You know, just starving. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=942.5999999999999s)]
*  The only means of reaching Palestinians in Gaza does not feel like the right solution [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=944.3199999999999s)]
*  to the problem of 12 those 12 people. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=950.1199999999999s)]
*  You know, it feels punitive to the broader population. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=952.4799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And the other sort of update from a U.S. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=956.64s)]
*  perspective is last week, Tony Blinken announced that any expansion of Israeli settlements [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=958.52s)]
*  in the West Bank would be inconsistent with international law. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=964.76s)]
*  That was longstanding U.S. policy until the Trump folks reversed it. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=967.76s)]
*  I think I was glad to see Tony do it. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=971.9599999999999s)]
*  I guess my kind of reaction was, I wonder why it took so long. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=973.68s)]
*  Yeah, I actually, you know, I actually got frustrated to be reminded that that they [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=976.76s)]
*  hadn't done it yet because that was U.S. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=981.4399999999999s)]
*  policy forever, you know, and it speaks to the kind of weird caution that they had on [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=983.6s)]
*  this issue out of the gate because it's not it shouldn't be controversial that settlements [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=989.28s)]
*  are inconsistent with national law. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=994.44s)]
*  They are. You know, it's not some big new finding by the United States. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=995.88s)]
*  So again, I'm glad they did it. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=999.36s)]
*  I think what it speaks to is there's another pathway here where the U.S. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1002.52s)]
*  You know, you also saw these sanctions on a few settler leaders. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1006.6800000000001s)]
*  I don't know why that shouldn't go up to people like Ben Gavir and these people in the [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1009.96s)]
*  government that are literally saying crazy shit all the time about, you know, moving [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1013.96s)]
*  settlements and displacing people in Gaza, kind of wiping out the Palestinians, taking [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1020.52s)]
*  all the land. Like, if that's not U.S. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1025.44s)]
*  policy, then again, there should be some consequences for the people that are really [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1027.72s)]
*  driving an extremist agenda. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1031.76s)]
*  And so hopefully this is the beginning of tackling that problem and not kind of the end [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1034.1200000000001s)]
*  of a policy process. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1039.56s)]
*  Yeah. And just, you know, when Netanyahu returned to power in twenty twenty two with his far [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1040.72s)]
*  right coalition, the number of settlement expansions exploded. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1044.84s)]
*  It went from like it was like three X. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1049.2s)]
*  Yeah. In twenty twenty three, what it was the year before, just in terms of all the [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1052.08s)]
*  states of the bureaucratic process. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1056.6s)]
*  So it does seem like they've been acting with impunity for a while. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1058.0s)]
*  It's interesting. The administration, though, like there's all this pressure for them to [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1060.52s)]
*  do more in Gaza. They've really been focusing on the settlement piece of it in this case [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1062.84s)]
*  belatedly. But, you know, it's just sort of interesting that like the carrot and the [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1067.24s)]
*  stick are not necessarily about the same thing. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1071.88s)]
*  Yeah. The policy. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1073.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. And it speaks to I'm sure they're concerned that the settler kind of movement [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1075.0400000000002s)]
*  is the driving engine behind this governing coalition. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1080.68s)]
*  That's right. Yeah. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1084.0s)]
*  But that is manifesting Gaza more than anywhere else, too. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1085.48s)]
*  I mean, the situation in the West Bank is concerning as well. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1088.8000000000002s)]
*  But it does speak to we talk about military assistance being conditioned. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1091.24s)]
*  We talk about calling for and voting for a ceasefire at the UN. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1095.48s)]
*  Another pathway of trying to affect this extremism on the far right of Israeli [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1098.52s)]
*  politics is going more directly at the agenda and the leadership of the settler [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1104.2s)]
*  movement in terms of sanctions and and calling out the illegality of the [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1110.68s)]
*  enterprise. Yeah. I mean, speaking of international legal pressure, last month we [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1116.16s)]
*  spoke about the case of the International Court of Justice that had been brought by [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1120.56s)]
*  South Africa accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza this week. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1123.96s)]
*  Hearings wrapped up in a different case that had originally been brought against [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1128.16s)]
*  Israel in 2022, which questioned if Israel is violating international law through [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1131.56s)]
*  the way it is controlled lands in the West Bank, Gaza and occupied Jerusalem for [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1136.1200000000001s)]
*  the last 50 plus years. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1139.92s)]
*  So the scope is huge because there's like 50 countries participating. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1141.48s)]
*  Israel has refused to take part in the proceedings. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1145.28s)]
*  The U.S. position is basically the ICJ should not be attempting to resolve the [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1147.52s)]
*  Israeli-Palestinian conflict through an advisory opinion that is just based on a [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1151.6s)]
*  case made by the Palestinian side. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1155.76s)]
*  That said, the outcome could come in a few months. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1158.6399999999999s)]
*  It would be nonbinding. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1160.8799999999999s)]
*  But we talked with Ona Hathaway again. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1162.28s)]
*  She's the founder and director of the Center for Global Legal Challenges at Yale [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1165.36s)]
*  Law School. And she talked to us about just the wide ranging potential legal [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1168.6799999999998s)]
*  ramifications from this case. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1173.0s)]
*  Here's what Ona had to say. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1175.1599999999999s)]
*  If the decision says that some or all of the actions Israel's undertaken in [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1176.4s)]
*  occupied territories and and or in Palestine, depending on how you see it, are [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1182.96s)]
*  unlawful, then that could have an impact on all the organs of the General Assembly. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1188.68s)]
*  So all the different bodies of the General Assembly then take that decision under [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1192.96s)]
*  advisement and it may affect the ways in which those organs are willing to interact [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1198.6000000000001s)]
*  with Israel. And, you know, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1203.92s)]
*  Philippe Sands in what is one of the more powerful presentations that were given [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1205.84s)]
*  before the court basically called on all states not to support and assist Israel [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1212.08s)]
*  going forward. And he said that the right of self-determination requires that member [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1219.36s)]
*  states bring Israel's occupation to an immediate end. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1223.72s)]
*  And he said no aid, no assistance, no complicity, no contribution by forcible [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1227.1999999999998s)]
*  actions, no money, no arms, no trade, no nothing. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1232.3999999999999s)]
*  That's what he called on member states to do. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1236.6799999999998s)]
*  And I think that that's what Palestine is hoping it will get out of this, is that if [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1241.04s)]
*  there is a decision by the court that the actions by Israel are illegal, then that [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1245.9599999999998s)]
*  is going to cause a cascade. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1252.4399999999998s)]
*  That's the hope of the advocates of this position to lead states to pull back [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1255.24s)]
*  support and assistance for Israel as long as that occupation and certainly as long [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1261.04s)]
*  as this conflict continues. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1265.1599999999999s)]
*  Pretty remarkable. Yeah. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1267.56s)]
*  The complexities this could create for U.S. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1269.0s)]
*  policy, both these cases. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1270.8s)]
*  Well, you know, the U.S. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1272.04s)]
*  is kind of an actor to it as well, because we are the ones that are providing the bulk [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1273.24s)]
*  of the military assistance to Israel and diplomatic support. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1278.72s)]
*  The U.S. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1282.24s)]
*  government could find itself kind of dragged into these legal proceedings. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1283.0s)]
*  And look, I think whatever your view of this, the reality is, you know, the kind of [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1287.64s)]
*  talking points loop of the U.S. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1295.96s)]
*  government, at least under this administration, wouldn't be under Trump, is about the [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1297.72s)]
*  rules based order. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1301.44s)]
*  And this is the enterprise that is the rules based order. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1302.48s)]
*  Even in the criticism always of the U.S. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1308.96s)]
*  is we like a rules based order when we're enforcing the rules on other countries. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1312.48s)]
*  Again, I think what this could do is lead to a further fracturing of whatever used to [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1319.64s)]
*  be the rules based order, because we seem to be moving further and further into reality [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1325.28s)]
*  in which all different big, powerful states just are being pretty selective on the menu [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1329.6000000000001s)]
*  of the rules that they choose to follow and the times that they do. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1336.04s)]
*  And so one outcome could be a further fracturing of the international system that the U.S. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1339.08s)]
*  frankly built after World War Two. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1344.84s)]
*  And I think whatever happens, I think that is a likely outcome. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1346.84s)]
*  It just depends on how much that happens. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1352.12s)]
*  Yeah. Fascinating to watch. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1353.68s)]
*  Let's talk about the reaction by Iran and its proxy groups to the war in Gaza. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1356.08s)]
*  So a few weeks back, an Iranian proxy group fired a drone at a U.S. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1360.8s)]
*  base in Jordan that killed three U.S. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1364.84s)]
*  That was one of at least 170 attacks on U.S. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1367.4s)]
*  troops in the Middle East since mid-October and part of this drastic escalation by Iranian [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1369.88s)]
*  forces since the war started in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1374.28s)]
*  The U.S. responded to that strike in Jordan with airstrikes in Iraq and Syria against [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1378.56s)]
*  these Iranian-linked proxy groups. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1384.1200000000001s)]
*  And there have been just wave after wave of airstrikes in Yemen. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1385.8s)]
*  The idea was to deter attacks on U.S. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1389.2s)]
*  personnel or, in the case of the Houthis, attacks on ships in the Red Sea. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1391.24s)]
*  So the New York Times had a piece this week kind of looking at the results, and they [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1394.64s)]
*  found that since the U.S. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1398.52s)]
*  response in Iraq and Syria, there have been no attacks on U.S. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1400.24s)]
*  bases in Iraq and only two minor attacks in Syria. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1403.8000000000002s)]
*  So that's good. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1406.8400000000001s)]
*  The Times reported that the head of the IRGC went to Baghdad and told these militia groups [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1408.1200000000001s)]
*  basically to dial it down because they didn't want a direct war with the U.S. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1412.3600000000001s)]
*  and because Iranian officials believed it would distract from Gaza. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1415.6000000000001s)]
*  I think they thought they were winning like the PR war in Gaza and they didn't want the [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1418.3600000000001s)]
*  focus to be on them. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1421.5600000000002s)]
*  The situation in Lebanon and Yemen is totally different. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1423.28s)]
*  Hezbollah and Israeli forces are trading shots daily, including there was an Israeli [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1426.28s)]
*  strike 60 miles deep into Lebanon recently. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1430.84s)]
*  And then the Houthi rebels in Yemen keep attacking ships in the Red Sea constantly. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1434.36s)]
*  And the U.S., the U.K., this broader coalition of countries keeps blowing up Houthi [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1439.52s)]
*  targets. I think there was one over the weekend. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1444.6799999999998s)]
*  So, Ben, I mean, I don't know. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1446.6799999999998s)]
*  It's hard for me to see what there's not a clear takeaway from this story. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1448.0s)]
*  Right. But do you have any thoughts about what this says about like deterrence? [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1452.2s)]
*  What works? [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1454.52s)]
*  I think that like we shouldn't over or under read this news in the sense that it's [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1457.32s)]
*  pretty obvious that the Iranians were kind of watching this escalation happening and [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1464.16s)]
*  got to a place even before, by the way, the U.S. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1469.1200000000001s)]
*  strikes because they could feel those coming. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1471.32s)]
*  You know, Qatab Hezbollah, the group that was responsible for the strike that killed [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1474.8s)]
*  the U.S. service members, was putting out statements being like, OK, we're done. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1478.56s)]
*  Sorry, our bad. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1482.24s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And and so it's pretty clear that they want to kind of keep their head [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1482.88s)]
*  down for a little bit here. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1487.1200000000001s)]
*  And I do think it's tied to both this thing that this is escalating kind of beyond what [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1489.76s)]
*  we even envisioned, but also this idea that like, why don't we just keep the focus on [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1494.1200000000001s)]
*  Gaza? But at the same time, I wouldn't overstate it either, because there's been an ebb and [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1498.04s)]
*  flow to these things for years. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1503.88s)]
*  You know, the groups aren't going away. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1506.08s)]
*  And, yeah, the bigger, more powerful ones, which are Lebanese Hezbollah and the [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1508.8s)]
*  Houthis, they're kind of still at it at their own pace. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1514.36s)]
*  And and so, yeah, I think for the time being, like things have calmed a bit in this one [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1517.48s)]
*  area of Iraq and Syria. And that that's good. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1523.12s)]
*  But I don't think anybody should think that that means that we've permanently restored [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1526.56s)]
*  deterrence and that these groups are kind of changed their colors like or, by the way, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1529.76s)]
*  that the U.S. shouldn't be thinking about whether or not, as we said a few weeks ago, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1534.04s)]
*  it's a good idea to even have some of these troops in these outposts in places like Syria. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1538.24s)]
*  I'd actually be taking advantage of this window to maybe, you know, take a look at that [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1542.68s)]
*  footprint and get some people out of there so that there's not the next time there's a [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1546.28s)]
*  flare up. There's not as many vulnerable U.S. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1550.64s)]
*  service members in the way. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1552.48s)]
*  But for the time being, you know, it feels like we're in a downward [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1554.4s)]
*  trajectory in this one area of Iraq and Syria, but less so in Yemen and Lebanon. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1560.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the Times analysis really ascribed a lot of it to to Qasem Soleimani, the [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1565.52s)]
*  former head of the IRGC, who Trump assassinated, kept a lot of these groups on a very tight [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1569.56s)]
*  leash. Yeah, the new guy apparently gave him a lot more room to run a franchise model, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1573.88s)]
*  which caused some problems for them. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1578.8s)]
*  But I'm still with you that I think solving the underlying problem in Gaza is the way to [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1580.3200000000002s)]
*  manage this for good. But there was some more rare good news out of Iran, Ben. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1585.56s)]
*  So there was a new report from the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, that [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1588.8799999999999s)]
*  shows that Iran has been reducing its stockpile of nuclear weapons grade material. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1593.96s)]
*  So the Wall Street Journal reported that for the first time since they started producing [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1598.4s)]
*  highly enriched uranium at 60 percent in 2021, Iran has started to reduce that stockpile [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1602.0s)]
*  by diluting it. If that all sounds like technical jargon, that's OK. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1607.08s)]
*  It is. Just know that we don't want Iran to have more highly enriched uranium because [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1611.52s)]
*  that's the stuff you use to make a bomb. And the more enriched it is, the more quickly you can do [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1615.8s)]
*  it. This news doesn't mean that their overall program isn't expanding. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1619.6s)]
*  It is. But it does seem like a sign of de-escalation to the U.S. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1623.96s)]
*  and other Western countries who watch these things closely. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1628.08s)]
*  Ben, reading these reports, it made my like NSC nerd spidey senses tingle a little bit [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1631.0s)]
*  and wonder if this was some sort of like confidence building effort as part of, I don't [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1635.6399999999999s)]
*  know, secret talks we don't know about through Oman or something. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1640.1599999999999s)]
*  I know. Is that too hopeful? Too nerdy? [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1642.96s)]
*  No, I think that, look, the Iranians, like you said, they've ramped up their program. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1645.0s)]
*  Congratulations, Iran deal opponents. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1649.76s)]
*  They want to have the kind of capability, if they so choose, to potentially break glass [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1653.04s)]
*  and maybe get enough material for weapon. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1658.04s)]
*  They'd have to figure out how to weaponize it. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1660.3600000000001s)]
*  But what I wonder, the two things, one is, are there back channel discussions and is [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1663.24s)]
*  this some kind of signal of, you know, we're not looking for the nuclear crisis now and [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1668.76s)]
*  maybe there's some diplomatic pathway somewhere with the U.S. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1672.56s)]
*  towards some version of an Iran nuclear agreement that's probably not as ambitious as the [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1677.04s)]
*  last one. Or, you know, the key partners for the Iranians are the Russians and the Chinese. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1681.6399999999999s)]
*  Are they talking to the Russians and Chinese and saying, OK, let's not like introduce the [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1689.0s)]
*  nuclear piece of this now, like just dial it back a little bit, you know, keep the [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1692.9199999999998s)]
*  focus on Gaza. That's embarrassing the Americans. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1697.84s)]
*  That's obviously undermining Israel's standing in the world. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1700.6s)]
*  You know, there's got to be some reason for it. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1705.04s)]
*  And I have to think that it's some version of all three, right? [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1709.84s)]
*  Like not looking for the the war of the nuclear program at this point, maybe some consultation [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1712.48s)]
*  with their kind of key partners and maybe maybe some kind of back channel conversations [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1717.72s)]
*  that are just meant to signal a willingness to talk about this. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1723.68s)]
*  Maybe they could do get the negotiator some ice cream and like Muscat or, you know, I [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1727.36s)]
*  don't know where else. Switzerland somewhere. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1732.3999999999999s)]
*  Zurich. Yeah, that's like a good Geneva. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1734.84s)]
*  Geneva. You know, the last time it was Oman, Geneva, Vienna. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1738.04s)]
*  Yeah, I went to the Iran deal talks in Geneva and it was this beautiful chalet on the [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1742.44s)]
*  lake and just a ton of people smoking cigs. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1747.08s)]
*  Yeah, didn't seem like a lot got done. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1750.0s)]
*  A lot of smoking at these diplomatic. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1751.28s)]
*  Ripping butts. That was not good for my health in the. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1753.2s)]
*  Yeah. Everywhere I looked, I assumed like that plant would be like a CIA listening [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1755.92s)]
*  tree. Yeah, you know, you'd be in one of those lobbies and you'd look around the lobby [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1759.88s)]
*  at these things and think that like what percentage of the people in this lobby are in [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1764.64s)]
*  some intelligence. 110 percent. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1768.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, like a dude with like a flower lapel pointing at you. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1770.24s)]
*  Exactly. A lot of listening. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1772.68s)]
*  Don't think that your AirPods aren't connected to nine phones in that lobby. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1775.44s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. So we talked a lot last week about the war in Ukraine in the run up to [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1779.16s)]
*  this year anniversary. So we'll get a little shorter on that topic today. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1783.12s)]
*  But a couple of things we wanted to flag first, Hungary officially approved Sweden's [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1785.9199999999998s)]
*  entry into NATO. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1790.36s)]
*  That comes after the Swedish prime minister visited Hungary and announced that Sweden's [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1791.7199999999998s)]
*  going to provide Hungary with four Swedish jets. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1795.56s)]
*  So that's how deals get done, I guess, Ben. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1798.28s)]
*  But this, along with Finland's entry into NATO last spring, means that the NATO presence [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1801.36s)]
*  in the North Sea around the Baltics will be a hell of a lot stronger, which Putin will [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1805.6799999999998s)]
*  hate. Though I did read that Finland dismantled 90 percent of its army and 70 percent [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1809.28s)]
*  of its Navy and Air Force after the Soviet Union collapsed as a hell of a peace dividend [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1814.28s)]
*  for those guys. And also looks like Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte will be the next [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1819.48s)]
*  secretary general. So you're kind of classic northern European. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1823.92s)]
*  Well, he's been around forever. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1828.32s)]
*  So he's an obvious choice. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1829.8799999999999s)]
*  You know, the funny thing about the Orban piece is, you know, Orban [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1832.24s)]
*  thinks it makes him look like super strong to like hold up Sweden for a while. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1837.2s)]
*  But in the end, kind of looks weak. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1841.76s)]
*  You got four planes. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1843.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, because it's like, oh, you know, look at me. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1844.44s)]
*  I showed that I can like be the spoiler and hold these people out and make the Swedish [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1846.24s)]
*  prime minister come visit me. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1850.52s)]
*  But at the end of the day, he caves. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1852.12s)]
*  So I actually don't know that, like, he looks like such a tough guy. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1853.6399999999999s)]
*  You know, I don't either. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1857.36s)]
*  You kind of got strong armed. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1858.44s)]
*  Yeah. So congratulations on your four planes. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1859.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, way to be a victor. Have fun at CPAC. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1862.08s)]
*  I was I will say I was in Sweden and, you know, great country. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1863.76s)]
*  But you're like you're aware that under the surface and it goes back hundreds of [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1868.64s)]
*  years, there's like a Viking thing happening under the surface. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1872.48s)]
*  It should hit the fan. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1877.48s)]
*  Talking DNA or volcanoes. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1879.0s)]
*  I'm talking about DNA. I'm talking about it like the shit hit the fan. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1880.32s)]
*  I wouldn't want to. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1882.84s)]
*  Swords are coming around with that, like those beards are going to grow and the swords [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1883.8s)]
*  could. Yeah, they're going to take you out. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1887.08s)]
*  Yeah, they're some serious dudes. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1889.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, just watch Thor. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1891.2s)]
*  I mean, the Norwegians are involved in this. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1892.64s)]
*  The Danes. I mean, it's not just the Swedes, but I'm just saying that these people, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1894.0800000000002s)]
*  you know, they're reasonable and peaceful people. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1898.0400000000002s)]
*  But, you know, there's a little arrogance in there. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1899.8400000000001s)]
*  There's some foreign like Viking comedy on Netflix at the moment that I tried to [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1903.68s)]
*  get into. I didn't take but I'm going to go back. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1908.64s)]
*  Be curious to the pitch meeting on that. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1911.5600000000002s)]
*  It's what made over there. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1914.1200000000001s)]
*  OK, the other thing that I want to flag is just there's been a lot of news on just [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1915.8400000000001s)]
*  the astronomical casualty count from this war. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1920.12s)]
*  So President Zelensky announced that 31000 Ukrainian soldiers have died in the last [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1922.8s)]
*  two years. A lot of analysts think the real number is even higher than that. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1927.0s)]
*  On the Russian side, a Russian military blogger recently said that Russia lost 16000 [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1930.32s)]
*  troops just during the battle for Avdivka, along with 300 armored vehicles. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1935.52s)]
*  So 16000 deaths in a battle for a place that everyone involved says has like [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1940.76s)]
*  symbolic value, but limited strategic value. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1946.08s)]
*  So, of course, like Russia's bigger, that is a bigger population, it's like three [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1949.12s)]
*  times the size of Ukraine. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1952.76s)]
*  And Putin conscripted around 300000 guys in 2022. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1954.1999999999998s)]
*  So I guess on paper he can afford to lose all these people. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1957.56s)]
*  But it's still shocking. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1960.1999999999998s)]
*  And then on the Ukrainian side, they're debating whether to pass a new modified [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1961.76s)]
*  conscription bill. Apparently, the military asked for 450000 to 500000 new troops. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1966.36s)]
*  Zelensky is not sure it's workable. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1971.6799999999998s)]
*  According to Michael Kaufman, who's a military analyst who focuses on Russia and [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1974.12s)]
*  Ukraine, the average age of Ukrainian soldier is over 40 years old. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1977.12s)]
*  Imagine like being on the front lines for weeks and weeks and weeks at our age and [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1981.6s)]
*  they desperately need more troops. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1986.52s)]
*  Zelensky is worried about calling up these young guys because of what it would do to [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1988.8799999999999s)]
*  the economy, what losing that generation would mean for Ukraine's future as a [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1992.2399999999998s)]
*  state, and the uncertainty of whether the US is going to be around to actually [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=1996.04s)]
*  train and assist these guys. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2000.6399999999999s)]
*  So I just wanted to flag that then, because like obviously the human death [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2002.2399999999998s)]
*  is so awful, but also to make the point that one, I mean, again, like even [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2006.1200000000001s)]
*  Ukraine's ability to call up more troops is dependent on this US fight in Congress. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2011.6000000000001s)]
*  And two, when you hear about the status quo as is, it's just it's not a recipe [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2017.32s)]
*  for a stalemate in the long run. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2022.96s)]
*  It's it's a setup where Ukraine is going to lose the war absent more support and [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2024.48s)]
*  like some serious internal changes as well. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2029.2s)]
*  Yeah, and I mean, on the Ukrainian side. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2032.1599999999999s)]
*  They've had this kind of theory of, you know, fighting for every inch of [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2036.1599999999999s)]
*  territory and and bleeding the Russians. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2041.28s)]
*  But the reality is, I don't know that they can continue to fight the war that way. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2044.6799999999998s)]
*  They just don't have as many people, even if the casualty count is higher on the [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2048.04s)]
*  Russian side, that's not how wars are won or lost. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2051.2799999999997s)]
*  And so I think they're going to have to be more selective about how and where they [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2054.2799999999997s)]
*  go on the offense and and the nature of the defense that they use, because, you [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2058.44s)]
*  know, there's just more Russians and and there's a willingness from Putin, I think, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2063.96s)]
*  to do whatever he needs to do from a conscription basis. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2067.68s)]
*  And given his kind of total dictatorial control, he doesn't have to worry about [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2071.12s)]
*  fractures in the society in the same way. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2075.08s)]
*  Now, on the Russian side, I I don't think he has to worry in the near term about [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2078.2000000000003s)]
*  like sustaining the war effort. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2082.6s)]
*  It's in the medium and longer term, as we talked about last week, what is going to [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2084.7200000000003s)]
*  happen to the communities that are losing all these people? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2088.88s)]
*  You know, and and that, I think, is a real threat to Russia internally in the not too [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2091.44s)]
*  distant future. And I don't know that I don't mean that that's some strategy for [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2098.28s)]
*  Ukraine to win the war, but it's something to watch. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2102.7200000000003s)]
*  Like, I just don't know what Russia is going to look like in five years. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2104.76s)]
*  If they've lost hundreds of thousands of people, that's widows, that's people that [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2107.48s)]
*  aren't that are lost to the economy, that's veterans returning home with wounds [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2112.24s)]
*  and and issues. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2118.04s)]
*  You know, I the bill will come due for this incredible loss on the Russian side. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2119.68s)]
*  The question is just how and when. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2127.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, so in Ukraine, men between the ages of 18 and 26 can't be drafted, but [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2129.56s)]
*  they're encouraged to volunteer. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2134.08s)]
*  Men between 27 and 60 years old can be drafted and forced to mobilize. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2135.6s)]
*  They're kind of debating whether to adjust the ages on their conscription laws. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2141.16s)]
*  But part of the challenge is exactly what you were just describing, which is that [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2144.32s)]
*  Ukraine just has a much lower percentage of its population in that younger generation. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2147.76s)]
*  And they're worried about just hollowing out the future of the country. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2153.64s)]
*  Yeah. Killing off the people who would live there and like, keep the state going. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2156.24s)]
*  Yeah. And will people return? [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2160.04s)]
*  And they also have the question of how long do people stay in? [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2161.92s)]
*  Because, I mean, some of these people have been like two years on the front line, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2164.72s)]
*  you said. And like, there's got to be some ability for them to rotate out. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2167.68s)]
*  I mean, people have to see their families. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2171.68s)]
*  People have to they need a break. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2173.28s)]
*  You know? Yeah. Yeah. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2175.08s)]
*  Last week, we also talked a lot about Alexei Navalny, the Russian opposition leader [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2176.84s)]
*  and anti-corruption activist who was murdered in a Russian penal colony on February 16th. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2180.0s)]
*  Some updates there. So according to Navalny's team, his body has now finally been [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2185.2s)]
*  returned to his mother. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2189.44s)]
*  She had been in this awful public battle with prison officials. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2190.8s)]
*  She was trying to locate the body, then get them to release it to her. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2193.9599999999996s)]
*  It was awful. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2197.52s)]
*  Prison officials were putting conditions on the release. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2198.72s)]
*  They were telling his mother that she had to agree to a secret funeral [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2201.16s)]
*  or else he would be buried at this penal colony. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2204.24s)]
*  Now Navalny's team is saying they're unable to find a venue in Russia [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2206.7999999999997s)]
*  that will hold his funeral for him. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2210.4399999999996s)]
*  They're like releasing videos, trying to ask anyone for help. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2212.12s)]
*  And they want to hold a public service at the end of this week. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2215.3199999999997s)]
*  Navalny's team has also said that negotiations for his release [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2218.3199999999997s)]
*  as part of a prisoner exchange were in the final stages before his death. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2222.2s)]
*  That was supposedly a deal that would have included [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2226.16s)]
*  Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gurskiewicz and security executive [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2228.6s)]
*  Paul Whalen, who's been detained for several years. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2231.9199999999996s)]
*  They were all in exchange for a man named Vadim Krasnikov, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2234.7599999999998s)]
*  a Russian convicted of killing a former Chechen separatist fighter in Germany. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2238.2799999999997s)]
*  So it sounds like the US and the Germans [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2241.96s)]
*  might have been talking about the outlines of this deal, obviously, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2245.2799999999997s)]
*  since the Germans are holding the guy that the Russians want. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2248.6s)]
*  But the US, the scoring NBC News, the US hadn't yet approached [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2251.16s)]
*  the Russians about this deal yet. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2254.92s)]
*  I don't know what to make of this report. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2256.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm skeptical that Putin would release Navalny. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2259.7200000000003s)]
*  And I'm also skeptical that he would kill Navalny to scuttle a deal [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2262.36s)]
*  that he would have had to approve anyway. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2266.12s)]
*  But I don't know. What do you make of all this? [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2267.44s)]
*  I don't. I just don't think that that was going to happen. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2268.44s)]
*  I mean, I don't think Putin would. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2271.76s)]
*  Putin swaps people that he says are spies. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2273.76s)]
*  Evan Gurskiewicz is not, but they categorize it that way. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2276.0s)]
*  Releasing a Russian opposition leader for one guy. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2278.72s)]
*  It's clear the Russians want that guy. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2283.6s)]
*  He came up in the Brittany Griner context. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2285.24s)]
*  Yeah. But I just think that that's highly unlikely. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2286.9199999999996s)]
*  I will say, like, when you watch this stuff about the body [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2290.9599999999996s)]
*  and you watch this absurdity of them saying that Navalny died of natural causes [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2294.7999999999997s)]
*  and then not wanting to have a public funeral again, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2298.72s)]
*  like for a guy who's supposed to be in such control here, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2302.24s)]
*  what is he so scared of? You know, I mean, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2304.8799999999997s)]
*  there's a paranoia. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2308.0s)]
*  There's a pettiness, but also a paranoia, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2309.7200000000003s)]
*  like that they clearly feel like they have to keep the lid on so tight. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2311.6s)]
*  It might be because they sense that if you allow the lid to peak up an inch, [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2315.6800000000003s)]
*  like it could explode. And so I think in death, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2319.32s)]
*  Navalny is once again illustrating the kind of weakness of Putin in a lot of ways. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2323.44s)]
*  I don't want to overstate that Putin's in control, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2329.4s)]
*  but it is the case that like if you can't even allow for there to be a funeral [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2331.84s)]
*  for somebody because you're so afraid of what that would be like, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2336.0s)]
*  maybe you're not as firmly in control as you're projecting to the rest of the world [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2340.04s)]
*  and to Tucker Carlson in the Moscow Metro. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2343.52s)]
*  Yeah. And it does seem so petty and so small. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2347.44s)]
*  And we talked last week about how there were, you know, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2349.12s)]
*  security officials were beating up people just like putting down flowers [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2351.24s)]
*  at memorials and things. You know, it's just brutality. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2354.56s)]
*  Speaking of Russia, Ben, so it's election season is coming up. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2357.88s)]
*  You got artificial intelligence making it easier than ever to make fake images [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2361.64s)]
*  and audio and videos. And then NBC's make good ones. Thank you. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2365.32s)]
*  I did not make the Biden robo call, but I wish I had mine would have been funnier. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2370.04s)]
*  NBC News had a story on Monday. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2374.48s)]
*  The headline was Russia's 2024 election interference has already begun. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2376.4s)]
*  That is mostly about Russia using these fake online accounts and bot networks to [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2380.1200000000003s)]
*  spread disinformation or just real negative stories about Biden or Democrats [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2384.0800000000004s)]
*  or anyone who wants to support Ukraine or NATO. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2388.84s)]
*  The Russians are doing similar things in Europe ahead of the European [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2391.6800000000003s)]
*  parliamentary elections in June. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2394.36s)]
*  But then it gets even weirder in the U.S. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2396.28s)]
*  where we recently learned that the key Republican witness in their farce of an [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2398.48s)]
*  impeachment effort against President Biden has ties to Russian intelligence. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2402.6800000000003s)]
*  Here's a clip from Congressman Jamie Raskin. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2406.44s)]
*  Now we know that Russian intelligence operatives were behind creating [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2409.0s)]
*  the propaganda and disinformation at the very foundation of this investigation. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2412.8s)]
*  So I think it's time for Chairman Comer and the Republicans to fold up the circus [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2416.96s)]
*  tent and we should get back to work for the American people. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2421.1200000000003s)]
*  Certainly it was a shattering revelation yesterday when we learned that Smirnoff [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2423.6s)]
*  was collecting his information from Russian intelligence operatives that were [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2428.08s)]
*  at the very base of this whole investigation. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2432.36s)]
*  Yesterday's revelations demonstrate that Putin's pattern of interference and [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2435.56s)]
*  destabilization of foreign Democratic elections around the world, including in [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2439.68s)]
*  America, has continued to this very day. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2444.2799999999997s)]
*  And this impeachment investigation is nothing but a wild goose chase that is [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2447.56s)]
*  based on Russian disinformation and propaganda. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2452.12s)]
*  So a little background. So this guy named Alexander Smirnoff, he was a trusted FBI [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2455.2s)]
*  informant who'd been paid by the U.S. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2459.48s)]
*  government for information about like oligarchs, officials, whatever. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2460.7999999999997s)]
*  In June of 2020, so in the middle of the last presidential election, Smirnoff told [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2464.52s)]
*  the FBI that the owner of Burisma, the big Ukrainian energy company that's been [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2468.52s)]
*  swirling around all the stories about Hunter Biden, had paid Joe Biden and Hunter [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2473.2799999999997s)]
*  Biden five million dollars each to stop an investigation into Burisma or to have [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2476.88s)]
*  Joe Biden do it when he was vice president. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2481.08s)]
*  The FBI is now indicted Smirnoff for lying because those allegations were made up. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2483.56s)]
*  It was very easy to call him on this lie. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2488.52s)]
*  Smirnoff said he met with Burisma officials in 2015 and 2016, but the FBI knew [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2490.52s)]
*  he met them for the first time in 2017. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2495.2400000000002s)]
*  There were lies about where he traveled. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2497.52s)]
*  And prosecutors also said that the information Smirnoff shared about the Bidens [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2499.56s)]
*  came from officials associated with Russian intelligence. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2504.7200000000003s)]
*  So Smirnoff's allegations, like they quickly leaked to the right wing press and to [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2507.92s)]
*  Republicans. So the House Republicans during the impeachment, they demanded these [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2512.6800000000003s)]
*  like FBI documents about, you know, what he had told them. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2517.6400000000003s)]
*  They then went public with them. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2521.7200000000003s)]
*  Now they look like fucking morons because this guy was clearly a Russian intel op. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2523.36s)]
*  Ben, even describing all of that to you is exhausting. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2528.48s)]
*  It makes me have 2017 PTSD. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2532.1200000000003s)]
*  But it's obviously also like a huge deal that these guys are already trying to mess [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2535.12s)]
*  with our elections or I guess. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2538.8s)]
*  And got all the way into an impeachment. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2540.2400000000002s)]
*  2020 election. Yeah, got through impeachment. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2541.44s)]
*  How do you combat this stuff when you have a Republican Party that would clearly rather [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2543.84s)]
*  destroy Joe Biden than guard against it? [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2547.92s)]
*  Well, I think I don't know. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2552.48s)]
*  I mean, there's these different categories, right? [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2556.0s)]
*  Because first of all, in the information space, it's just a cesspool. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2558.48s)]
*  And what people have to recognize is that the Russians don't create the origin of a [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2563.0s)]
*  lot of these conspiracy theories. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2567.16s)]
*  They see what's happening in our weird right wing fever dream ecosystem, and they [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2568.28s)]
*  come in and basically just pour gasoline on it and try to turbocharge conspiracy [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2573.2s)]
*  theories and anti-Biden content. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2577.2s)]
*  And they'll be doing that and they'll be doing a lot of that. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2578.64s)]
*  And AI, like you said, makes it easier for them to do that. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2580.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, there are some efforts that are underway to at least try to label the water [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2582.84s)]
*  market. So in this came up and I was in Munich in part, you know, to be a [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2587.08s)]
*  key in some of these conversations, because, you know, at a minimum, you know, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2592.96s)]
*  people should know. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2597.88s)]
*  I mean, the sad thing for me is that Twitter actually last time was labeling state [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2599.32s)]
*  sponsored content. You know, now it's like a cesspool of Elon Musk. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2603.44s)]
*  It's the worst. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2607.56s)]
*  But one thing on the information space is you'd like to at least be able to empower [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2608.12s)]
*  people with the information about where this is coming from. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2612.12s)]
*  I do worry this time about whether the Russians give them the stakes are very high [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2614.92s)]
*  for them. What do they do around the election itself? [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2618.44s)]
*  You know, is there much more dis and misinformation about voting or their [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2620.64s)]
*  efforts to kind of interfere with the voting process itself? [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2625.6s)]
*  So you have to kind of watch that space. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2628.2s)]
*  And then on this stuff, I mean, I don't know, Tommy, like the thing that is really [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2630.4s)]
*  frustrating and probably obvious is that there's such an over the top effort by [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2635.04s)]
*  Trump and his allies to kind of make all the Russia stuff feel like it was over [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2640.96s)]
*  torqued and it was a hoax and that people, you know, and I've even internalized it. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2646.24s)]
*  Well, and look, again, I hate to call out trolling, but like, you know, Glenn [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2650.84s)]
*  Greenwald's been like after me for years because I said something about the [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2654.56s)]
*  laptop being part of a Russian disinformation campaign, which, you know, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2659.4s)]
*  some of it was like, like this guy was a part of, you know, there are these, there's [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2663.92s)]
*  this policing of the the center left and left on this stuff that if you like, you [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2668.12s)]
*  get like anything is over cranked at all, you're cast as like a lunatic. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2674.28s)]
*  And yet actually the underlying truth is still there. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2679.28s)]
*  Like the Russian agents spreading disinformation to the point that they're [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2682.2400000000002s)]
*  literally the basis of impeachment of the president. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2685.96s)]
*  I had states and so pretty got ineffective. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2688.36s)]
*  I just think that we need to not be that, you know, self-constrained. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2690.56s)]
*  Sure. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2694.56s)]
*  We need to be careful and not make statements that we don't have information [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2694.76s)]
*  about or don't have credible information about, but like, don't let them work the [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2697.96s)]
*  ref so hard that we're not at least calling out like, Hey, this is what's [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2702.8s)]
*  happening, you know? [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2705.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2707.08s)]
*  And it's a good point. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2707.48s)]
*  I do think that this is more of a just an online phenomenon, but like we [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2708.2s)]
*  probably shouldn't have called Mitch McConnell, Moscow Mitch. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2712.56s)]
*  No, and we didn't need like Bob Mueller and like a superhero's uniform next to [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2714.7999999999997s)]
*  like, what's his name? [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2719.6s)]
*  Michael Avanade. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2720.96s)]
*  Avanade, yeah, good call back. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2721.72s)]
*  The kind of stupidity of some of that stuff, like undermine the fact that there [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2724.04s)]
*  really was some real, not just smoke, there's a lot of fire there too. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2727.8399999999997s)]
*  And it'll be here this election too. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2731.24s)]
*  And not everyone who disagrees with Biden's Ukraine policy is a Russian agent. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2732.96s)]
*  Right? [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2736.64s)]
*  Like there's good faith disagreements, but also two weeks before Slovakia's [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2737.3199999999997s)]
*  parliamentary elections in September, there was a fake audio clip showing like, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2741.24s)]
*  you know, that purported to show a pro Western party was trying to rig the [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2745.56s)]
*  election. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2748.8799999999997s)]
*  It was all made up in bullshit, but like that's going to happen. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2749.3199999999997s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2751.2799999999997s)]
*  Like the pro Russian autocrat won the Slovakian election. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2752.04s)]
*  I mean, so this stuff is real and has a real impact and the only anybody's we [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2756.24s)]
*  can think of is just trying to empower people with as much information as you [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2761.3599999999997s)]
*  can, knowing that even that is going to be out in this crazy space where there's [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2764.2s)]
*  no objective reality. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2768.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2770.2s)]
*  Speaking of far right weirdos abroad, let's talk about CPAC, the conservative [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2771.16s)]
*  political action conference. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2776.3199999999997s)]
*  It just ended. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2777.52s)]
*  It was, you know, your standard right wing buffet of bigotry bullshit and like [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2778.68s)]
*  Trump worship. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2783.2799999999997s)]
*  Trump spoke for an hour and a half, a bunch of literal Nazis attended. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2784.7999999999997s)]
*  They mingled with guests. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2788.64s)]
*  They were like goose stepping around and like doing the salute thing. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2789.7599999999998s)]
*  Once again, there were a smattering of right wing leaders. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2793.84s)]
*  There was Liz Truss, the idiot who was British prime minister for like six [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2797.08s)]
*  minutes. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2801.56s)]
*  There was Javier Millet, the right wing, anarcho capitalist president of Argentina. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2802.2000000000003s)]
*  There was the Bitcoin community's favorite dictator, Naib Buckeye from El [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2806.96s)]
*  Salvador. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2810.68s)]
*  We wanted to play you a clip, a couple of clips from Buckeye's speech to just get [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2811.88s)]
*  at how weird it was to have these guys come to the U.S. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2815.96s)]
*  Talk about kind of being autocrats publicly, all but endorse Trump in the kind [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2819.4s)]
*  of MAGA banning worldview. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2824.28s)]
*  Here's a couple clips. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2826.6s)]
*  Let's go with the first is about global elites. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2827.52s)]
*  Ben. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2829.8s)]
*  The global elites, they hate our success and they fear yours. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2830.04s)]
*  The people's free will to choose their leaders is something they despise because [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2838.44s)]
*  they cannot control that. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2843.88s)]
*  You have experienced this firsthand here in the United States. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2844.96s)]
*  The global elites control the mainstream media. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2848.8s)]
*  They finance campaigns, district attorneys to mention a few. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2851.8s)]
*  They abuse their powers. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2859.0s)]
*  They persecute political opponents. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2861.56s)]
*  In El Salvador, we don't weaponize our judicial system to persecute our political [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2865.36s)]
*  opponents. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2870.8s)]
*  A practice that may sound familiar to you, but we don't do that there. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2872.24s)]
*  And who's the dictator? [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2877.8399999999997s)]
*  That's a little joke. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2878.72s)]
*  Who's the dictator? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2879.56s)]
*  How weird is it? [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2880.6s)]
*  You're like an us versus them with a president of a foreign country versus like [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2881.3199999999997s)]
*  democracy or Democrats. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2885.52s)]
*  I guess, you know, first of all, what it does kind of demonstrate, though, is that [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2887.56s)]
*  there and this is another week, you know, poking at the same thing. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2893.4s)]
*  There and this is another week, you know, poking a little at the resistance that, [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2897.96s)]
*  you know, we were part of. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2904.12s)]
*  I think there was this effort to kind of cast Trump as this buffoon, you know, who [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2906.1600000000003s)]
*  kind of was dangerous, but, you know, a bit of an outlier to anything we'd seen in [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2910.56s)]
*  America. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2916.92s)]
*  No, this is like there's a real ideology behind it. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2917.92s)]
*  They'd like Bukele and Miele, these guys, like the fact that it travels around to [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2922.28s)]
*  such different places. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2927.4s)]
*  You know, Trump is as much a reflection of something happening in the world as he [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2929.28s)]
*  is somebody driving it. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2932.08s)]
*  I mean, there's just this kind of anti globalist, anti elites, autocratic [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2933.12s)]
*  populism that that travels and that has like a potency to it that needs to be taken [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2939.8s)]
*  seriously, even if it's totally hypocritical. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2945.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2947.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, Bukele, like Trump is projecting. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2947.92s)]
*  He does all those things. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2950.2400000000002s)]
*  He persecutes opponents. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2951.1600000000003s)]
*  He's got people in prison. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2952.2000000000003s)]
*  So I'm not suggesting it's true. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2953.52s)]
*  I marched troops into parliament. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2954.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2956.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2956.64s)]
*  I mean, this guy is like, yeah. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2956.8799999999997s)]
*  So like, but it like, let's, you know, this is going to be around for a while. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2958.4s)]
*  And, and actually, that's my second point, which is that we, we don't do this. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2961.6s)]
*  Why don't we do this? [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2965.72s)]
*  Why don't, I'm not saying we have a CPAC that's as crazy, but like, there's this [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2967.04s)]
*  reticence to kind of, you know, align with political parties and movements around the [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2971.48s)]
*  world. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2975.8799999999997s)]
*  Like the, I'd like there to be some gathering of, I mean, I've been to some of them, [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2976.2s)]
*  but they're like much more muted than this. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2981.56s)]
*  I mean, I, I, my US president probably doesn't speak at them, right? [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2985.3599999999997s)]
*  Like Trump stamping, like his reputation, imprimatur on this thing, getting a lot of [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2988.08s)]
*  eyeballs there. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2992.6s)]
*  Like that makes a difference. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2993.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2994.48s)]
*  My point is that the democratic party in this country needs to feel more invested in the [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2994.72s)]
*  success of center left and left politicians around the world and need not be shy about [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=2999.2799999999997s)]
*  it. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3006.0s)]
*  Because look, these guys are very coordinated. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3006.52s)]
*  They're sharing messaging. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3010.4s)]
*  They're sharing media strategies. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3012.0s)]
*  They're sharing resources and we're just not doing that at the scale that we should be. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3014.3199999999997s)]
*  And so weirdly we could learn something from CPAC. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3019.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3023.12s)]
*  And like we have one more clip. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3023.3599999999997s)]
*  I'll just summarize it because we're going a little long, but like, like Bukele has like [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3024.24s)]
*  a minute long extended riff about George Soros. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3027.72s)]
*  And it's just fascinating that these guys have all found a common enemy to like bring [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3031.2799999999997s)]
*  this group of right wing zealots. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3035.3599999999997s)]
*  A man in his nineties. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3036.9599999999996s)]
*  You know, it's like, when you, when I was listening to the BBC world podcast, they were [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3038.04s)]
*  running around CPAC talking to people like these folks now all oppose Ukraine funding. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3042.56s)]
*  They're all like big Bolsonaro fans, right? [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3046.64s)]
*  There's like a herd mentality on foreign policy where they're all getting behind the [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3048.88s)]
*  same things. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3052.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3053.12s)]
*  And it's what they're doing that's interesting and smart is people are sick of globalization [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3053.44s)]
*  for some good reasons. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3061.92s)]
*  So the inequality that's been created, the sense that the system is broken and doesn't [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3063.12s)]
*  work anymore. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3068.2400000000002s)]
*  Now what they're doing is they're somehow tying all this to like George Soros, who's [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3069.52s)]
*  done like the, he's not, I mean, it's basically an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3073.2799999999997s)]
*  Yep. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3077.36s)]
*  And that's the other thing I'd say is that like all the people that are so concerned [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3077.6s)]
*  about like campus anti-Semitism, like why don't you look over here where the actual [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3080.56s)]
*  Nazis are showing up. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3084.24s)]
*  Literal Nazis. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3084.88s)]
*  And they're even the, the, the, the leaders are like calling themselves nationalist [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3085.6s)]
*  socialists. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3090.0s)]
*  Saying there's like a shadowy financier Jewish man pulling the strings. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3090.32s)]
*  But like, so you have to separate out the crazy and the bigotry from what is them [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3094.08s)]
*  connecting to, because the problem for center left parties right now is we're like the [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3099.68s)]
*  defenders of the establishment. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3103.6s)]
*  You know, like how dare you impugn the integrity of the intelligence community and, you [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3104.88s)]
*  know, and it's like, that's a little like no offense to the intelligence community, [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3108.72s)]
*  but that's not like the politically smart place to be these days. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3111.36s)]
*  Not a winning message. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3114.32s)]
*  We're also like usually hodgepodge and coalitions that are multi-ethnic in different [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3115.12s)]
*  views, et cetera. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3119.36s)]
*  A couple more quick things, Ben. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3120.4s)]
*  So the New York Times reported that American law enforcement officials spent years [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3121.68s)]
*  investigating allegations that president Lopez Obrador, AMLO, the president of Mexico [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3125.52s)]
*  had met with and taken millions of dollars from drug cartels after he took office. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3130.96s)]
*  Apparently these investigators found links between the cartels and officials close to [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3136.24s)]
*  AMLO, but no connection to AMLO himself. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3140.08s)]
*  So there was never a formal investigation. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3142.7999999999997s)]
*  ProPublica also recently reported that in 2006, the DEA heard allegations that drug [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3145.9199999999996s)]
*  traffickers had donated to AMLO's campaign at the time. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3151.52s)]
*  So this all became public and AMLO did a press conference to respond and he took it [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3155.04s)]
*  about as well as you'd expect. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3159.7599999999998s)]
*  He denied all the charges and he even read the New York Times, Mexico bureau chief's [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3161.2s)]
*  phone number allowed on TV during the press conference. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3165.04s)]
*  Obviously that's like, you want to laugh at that because it's sort of like peck-shelan [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3168.32s)]
*  and dickish. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3171.28s)]
*  It's like when Trump did that to Lindsey Graham. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3171.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3173.6s)]
*  But that was actually kind of great. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3174.08s)]
*  But in Mexico, you got a lot of reporters are getting murdered. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3175.84s)]
*  It's actually illegal to dock someone like that in Mexico. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3178.88s)]
*  Investigating AMLO for doing this stupid shit. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3181.84s)]
*  Anyway, not great all around the allegations, the response, all of it. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3184.08s)]
*  Ben, we should note that the former president of Honduras is currently on trial in New York [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3187.84s)]
*  for drug trafficking. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3191.84s)]
*  So it's not unprecedented to prosecute a former head of state. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3192.7200000000003s)]
*  Could you imagine what would have happened if they tried to bring charges against a sitting [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3196.8s)]
*  head of state like this? [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3201.2000000000003s)]
*  How the fuck would that work? [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3202.08s)]
*  Yeah, and a very popular one of a big important country that is absolutely essential to any [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3203.76s)]
*  effort to deal with our border or deal with the cartels. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3209.44s)]
*  So it was interesting that this kind of leaked out. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3212.16s)]
*  I'm kind of curious, like, were people that were investigating it discreditable, then [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3214.64s)]
*  they put it out. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3218.48s)]
*  The fact that the US can furiously backtrack. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3220.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, it shows you how much they need in Mexico. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3222.96s)]
*  We can't solve any of these problems without Mexico. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3225.6s)]
*  And so AMLO has a lot of leverage in this case. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3228.0s)]
*  Yeah, it really does. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3230.7200000000003s)]
*  You'd be like, come and get me. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3231.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3232.2400000000002s)]
*  Let's see it. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3232.56s)]
*  Speaking of corrupt presidents, former French president Nicolas Sarkozy was found guilty [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3233.52s)]
*  of illegally overspending during his 2012 presidential campaign. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3238.0s)]
*  How many crimes does that guy, you know, like a buffet? [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3240.96s)]
*  A buffet of crimes. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3244.16s)]
*  Well, it is a buffet. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3244.88s)]
*  He's going to appeal this one. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3245.68s)]
*  He might get like six months in his house with an ankle monitor, but whatever. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3246.72s)]
*  Is he still married to Carla Breen? [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3249.68s)]
*  I wondered that too. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3251.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3252.0s)]
*  We should look that up. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3252.64s)]
*  We should check that. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3253.2s)]
*  But to your point, in 2023, he was found guilty of trying to bribe a judge. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3254.24s)]
*  And next year, he's going to get tried for illegally taking money from now-deceased [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3258.4s)]
*  Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3263.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3265.2s)]
*  So that's a pretty big one. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3265.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3266.48s)]
*  Especially given how much, you know, Sarkozy wanted to take him out. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3266.8s)]
*  Not exactly a master criminal here. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3270.5600000000004s)]
*  No. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3272.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3272.8s)]
*  Not very good at job. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3273.28s)]
*  Ben, remember back in 2018, the Saudis executed the Washington Post opinion writer Jamal Khashoggi. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3275.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3281.6800000000003s)]
*  And there was felt like there was a sea change. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3281.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3283.44s)]
*  Business leaders wouldn't do business with the Saudis. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3284.1600000000003s)]
*  Some CEOs refused to go there or attend their Davos in the Desert investment conference. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3286.2400000000002s)]
*  I have some bad news for you. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3292.0800000000004s)]
*  A couple years and a few trillion dollars can make a hell of a lot of difference. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3293.6800000000003s)]
*  So now we have Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's personal think tank, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3296.4s)]
*  the Future Investment Initiative Institute. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3301.28s)]
*  What a name. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3303.6800000000003s)]
*  It's holding conferences here in the United States, including last week in Miami. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3304.7200000000003s)]
*  The topics were notionally big ideas like AI or climate change, [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3308.7200000000003s)]
*  but really it was just a bunch of star fuckers who wanted Saudi money. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3312.48s)]
*  We had Gwyneth Paltrow was there. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3315.2000000000003s)]
*  Rob Lowe, the CEOs of Blackstone and Palantir. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3317.44s)]
*  Some former Trump, I'm going to try to trigger you now, [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3321.28s)]
*  former Trump officials like Jared Kushner, Mike Pompeo, Steve Mnuchin. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3323.28s)]
*  According to a great report by a friend of the pod, [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3328.2400000000002s)]
*  Jonathan Geyer and the American Prospect, Larry Summers and Eric Schmidt [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3330.6400000000003s)]
*  did a panel where they reminisced about how much they missed Henry Kissinger. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3334.88s)]
*  Is this working? [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3338.6400000000003s)]
*  Guys, all my favorites. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3339.28s)]
*  The hits just keep on coming, Tommy. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3341.2000000000003s)]
*  Some American journalists hosted panels, hopefully not about Bonesaws. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3342.8s)]
*  Gwyneth was unironically talking about fighting the patriarchy during this Saudi hosted event. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3347.36s)]
*  So Ben, I guess the only silver lining here, I guess, is according to Jonathan, [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3353.6000000000004s)]
*  there were like only 50 people watching this live stream, this event that costs like millions. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3357.2000000000003s)]
*  But I don't know, man, like what's the lesson? Money always wins. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3361.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3364.4s)]
*  So depressing. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3364.7200000000003s)]
*  It's really depressing. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3365.36s)]
*  I mean, and you know what I'd say is like, how much is enough? [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3366.4s)]
*  I mean, we've said this before, but like Gwyneth, you're doing fine with the goop. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3370.0s)]
*  Is it really worth the appearance fee? [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3374.32s)]
*  Like you just sell your group and be cool with it. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3376.0800000000004s)]
*  Rob Lowe, like West Wing, like, you know, [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3379.52s)]
*  filled everybody with an earnest idealism. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3383.36s)]
*  What would Sam Seaborn have said about this appearance at the Davos on South Beach or [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3386.7200000000003s)]
*  whatever it was? [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3392.4s)]
*  Yes. Not good. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3392.96s)]
*  It just there's other ways to make a living without that appearance fee. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3394.4s)]
*  And yeah, like the Larry Summers chuckling, like about the good old days with Henry Kissinger, [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3399.36s)]
*  when you could take money from dictators and not get called out about it. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3404.1600000000003s)]
*  I mean, it's just, there's just a gotta be better. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3407.52s)]
*  And it, by the way, connects to the seatback thing. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3410.5600000000004s)]
*  Because that's the kind of stuff that people are mad about. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3413.28s)]
*  Now, obviously, like it skews right. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3415.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean, Jared's there and Trump is buddies of these people. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3418.4s)]
*  But like that kind of stuff is what people are looking at as this elite that just is [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3420.96s)]
*  totally out of touch with. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3427.2000000000003s)]
*  And hypocritical. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3428.4s)]
*  We, yeah, there's, you know, it just makes everybody look like hypocrites. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3429.1200000000003s)]
*  It's so maddening. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3432.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's so maddening. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3433.92s)]
*  And they're doing it in the U.S. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3434.8s)]
*  under the guise of these think tanks. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3436.7200000000003s)]
*  And, you know, the Saudi sovereign wealth fund is buying teams, you know, and pretending [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3438.88s)]
*  that it's not Mohammed bin Salman pulling the trigger. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3442.8s)]
*  I was like, of course he is. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3444.48s)]
*  Of course he's behind all of this. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3445.76s)]
*  It's just the worst. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3447.04s)]
*  He wins, we lose. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3448.0800000000004s)]
*  Finally. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3449.6000000000004s)]
*  That's the life lesson. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3450.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, that's a life lesson. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3451.2000000000003s)]
*  Finally, Ben, listeners to the show know that we're big fans of Australia. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3452.1600000000003s)]
*  And we're very grateful to the Aussies in particular for filling the back half of this [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3457.1200000000003s)]
*  show, this portion of the show, with lots of fun stories. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3461.28s)]
*  But today we owe you an apology. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3464.32s)]
*  So an Australian photographer has accused Taylor Swift's father of punching him in [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3466.0800000000004s)]
*  the face as Taylor and her crew got off a yacht. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3470.24s)]
*  Yeah, they were at a wharf in the Sydney area. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3473.2s)]
*  It was after Taylor's final concert tour. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3476.0s)]
*  Where the hell was Travis Kelsey is what I want to know. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3478.56s)]
*  Playing defense here. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3480.4799999999996s)]
*  So Taylor's dad is 71. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3481.9199999999996s)]
*  He punched a 51 year old photog. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3483.4399999999996s)]
*  The Australian media has this amazing video of Taylor walking with her dad, hiding under [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3486.3199999999997s)]
*  an umbrella. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3491.12s)]
*  And then her dad gives the photographer the bird in the process. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3491.9199999999996s)]
*  So I don't know what to make of this. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3495.2799999999997s)]
*  My favorite part of this story is that Taylor's spokesperson is quoted everywhere. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3496.64s)]
*  And her name is Tree Pain, which makes me wonder if, you know, she's being like Tree [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3500.3199999999997s)]
*  Pain, like Tree Pain, like she's trying to stop the trees pain. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3505.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't know that or she was unfairly maligned for using auto-tune. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3508.72s)]
*  That is actually very talented. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3512.7999999999997s)]
*  Could be either way. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3514.72s)]
*  Here's what I want to know. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3515.92s)]
*  Are we going to have to take Hugh Jackman hostage like Putin style so that we can swap [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3517.3599999999997s)]
*  him or Taylor Swift or her father? [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3521.2s)]
*  Is there like a legal proceeding though? [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3524.64s)]
*  I mean, like I can't imagine it's legal to just wind up and clock a photographer. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3526.24s)]
*  Well, it's Australia. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3530.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, actually, that's true. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3531.52s)]
*  Maybe that's all part of the charm. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3532.3999999999996s)]
*  Like, maybe that's the way to look at this whole incident. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3535.44s)]
*  It's like this is going to go over there. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3537.3599999999997s)]
*  You get in a fistfight after the yacht comes in and everybody like talks about it for a [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3538.56s)]
*  while and then moves on. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3543.6s)]
*  I mean, yeah, I don't know what to make of it. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3545.04s)]
*  It feels a little aggressive for the Taylor Swift dad. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3547.6s)]
*  Yeah, like, I mean, where's Jason Kelsey with his shirt off? [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3552.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3554.72s)]
*  Just kind of taking up a lot of space so you can't get a picture. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3555.36s)]
*  They could have beaten up everybody. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3558.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3559.6s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3560.0s)]
*  I have been listening to Colin Hay from Men at Work's solo stuff a lot recently. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3561.2000000000003s)]
*  Truly great. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3567.6s)]
*  I didn't know that there was solo stuff. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3568.6400000000003s)]
*  Well, some of them are like Men at Work songs that he just does like acoustic in places. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3570.6400000000003s)]
*  I've listened to that. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3574.1600000000003s)]
*  Excellent. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3575.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that is excellent. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3575.6s)]
*  Excellent. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3576.48s)]
*  Excellent. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3576.8s)]
*  Thank you, TikTok for injecting that into my brain. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3577.1200000000003s)]
*  Maybe what the solution is is that Taylor lets him be the opening act at the next show. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3578.56s)]
*  Taylor and Colin Hay. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3582.0s)]
*  Yeah, who's the headliner? [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3583.04s)]
*  Well, you know, it depends on what demographic. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3584.64s)]
*  Depends on where you are. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3586.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3587.44s)]
*  If you're in Sydney, maybe it's Colin. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3587.92s)]
*  That's probably Taylor anyway. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3590.08s)]
*  It's by Taylor anyway. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3591.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3592.0s)]
*  Well, good luck with that, Australia. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3592.16s)]
*  We hope you sorted out. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3593.68s)]
*  We're going to take a quick break and we come back. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3594.64s)]
*  You will hear Ben's interview about all the things that are happening in Myanmar. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3596.3199999999997s)]
*  So stick around for that. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3599.6s)]
*  So it's now been three years since a military coup in Myanmar ousted the [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3600.72s)]
*  elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3606.3199999999997s)]
*  That followed, of course, like a brutal period of ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3608.64s)]
*  during which Aung San Suu Kyi was silent. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3616.56s)]
*  And since the coup, we've seen a bloody civil war that the UN estimates has led to the [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3620.48s)]
*  displacement of 2.6 million further people. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3625.12s)]
*  But interestingly, in recent months, things have been shifting against the military junta [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3629.2000000000003s)]
*  inside of the country. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3633.6s)]
*  So joining me to talk about the latest developments and where this is all leading [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3634.56s)]
*  is a terrific activist and advocate, Wai Wai Ngu, who is a human rights activist from [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3640.32s)]
*  Myanmar and the director and founder of the Women's Peace Network. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3646.4s)]
*  It's so good to see you again after a few years, Wai Wai. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3649.68s)]
*  So good to see you too. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3651.84s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3653.04s)]
*  So I want to start with the situation just generally in Myanmar. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3654.4s)]
*  And then we'll also talk about the situation for the Rohingya people. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3658.08s)]
*  Beginning in Myanmar, so it's been three years since the coup. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3662.88s)]
*  Since then, I think to a lot of analysts, opposition forces seem to have shown [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3667.04s)]
*  a surprising strength in the civil war. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3672.88s)]
*  In recent weeks, there have been reports of thousands of young people trying to find a [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3675.2s)]
*  way out of the country to avoid a new conscription law that the military is trying to use to [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3679.36s)]
*  regenerate manpower. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3684.3199999999997s)]
*  That conscription move follows gains made by various rebel groups across the country [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3686.72s)]
*  who've been uniting and taking territory. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3691.68s)]
*  The exiled government, the National Unity Government, that's the opposition force, [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3694.7999999999997s)]
*  the kind of umbrella over the opposition, now says that some 60 percent of Myanmar's [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3698.3999999999996s)]
*  territory is under the control of resistance forces. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3703.2s)]
*  So just starting there, Wai Wai, based on your contacts and what you're following, [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3707.04s)]
*  what is your sense of the situation? [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3711.3599999999997s)]
*  Is it the case that the junta is kind of losing control? [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3714.3999999999996s)]
*  How do you assess what's happening in the country? [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3717.3599999999997s)]
*  Indeed, we have to acknowledge that junta was never able to control the country and [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3719.7599999999998s)]
*  consolidate its powers since the attempted coup in February 2021. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3728.0s)]
*  Due to their popular resistance to it, now add into this collective military operations [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3735.44s)]
*  by the ethnic arms group, it's become even harder to retain control of the territory, [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3742.7999999999997s)]
*  which we see they are losing by the day. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3750.24s)]
*  And it also shows how the Myanmar military or junta is weaker than many thought. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3752.7999999999997s)]
*  At the same time, we have also seen the junta uses every possible means to maintain the [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3760.16s)]
*  power, including commissions of serious international crimes such as crimes against [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3766.72s)]
*  humanity, war crimes through their discriminated uses of forces, shellings against the civilians [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3772.48s)]
*  and villages, widespread and systematic arrest, detentions, killing, rapes, and so on. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3781.04s)]
*  And now the latest information we are documenting is that the junta actually arresting young [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3789.6s)]
*  people on the street in the villages across the country. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3799.92s)]
*  And that is why many of them are lining up in front of the embassies and even to the [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3803.44s)]
*  point that result in unfortunate death of young people. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3809.52s)]
*  So there are a lot of optimistic view around what is going on and people are still hopeful [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3814.64s)]
*  and committed to defeat the military. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3821.52s)]
*  However, we are also extremely concerned about the situations on the ground, the impact on [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3825.04s)]
*  the women, young people and the people of Burma. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3831.7599999999998s)]
*  So there is a mixture of feeling among the people. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3835.52s)]
*  Although people are committed and united to defeat them, but we also have to acknowledge [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3839.52s)]
*  this, the catastrophic situations and find ways to end these, to end or to resolve the [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3845.2s)]
*  crisis in Burma as soon as possible. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3856.48s)]
*  So I'm curious about your view of the opposition forces. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3859.28s)]
*  For people who don't follow this that closely over the years, it was always the case in [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3864.56s)]
*  Burma or Myanmar that we can use that interchangeably, that you had these ethnic armed groups [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3869.92s)]
*  who were in conflict with the military. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3877.2799999999997s)]
*  And what I've noticed since the coup in 2021 is a greater degree of unity among different [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3881.6s)]
*  ethnic groups that are fighting and also among some Burmese who have joined forces with [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3890.08s)]
*  ethnic armed groups to oppose the junta. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3896.4s)]
*  So you have kind of a bigger tent, if you will, over these opposition forces who've [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3899.2000000000003s)]
*  put aside differences in some cases to fight together against the junta or to fight at [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3904.4s)]
*  least from a shared cause. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3909.28s)]
*  What is your assessment? [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3912.96s)]
*  How much is there a new sense of unity in forces opposing the junta? [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3914.96s)]
*  How much does the national unity government kind of reflect those opposition forces? [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3920.0s)]
*  And do you think that that can be sustained going forward? [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3926.6400000000003s)]
*  It is incredible that we achieve this level of unity and common understanding among the [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3929.36s)]
*  different ethnic groups and different political groups. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3937.52s)]
*  After these attempted coups in 2021, people across the country have started to realize [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3943.44s)]
*  the military is common enemy and we must defeat the military. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3951.44s)]
*  Basically, we must be able to dismantle current military institutions which have been in control [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3956.8s)]
*  in part for six, seven decades. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3969.6s)]
*  And they are the main sources of many atrocities to the economic poverty, to the [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3972.7999999999997s)]
*  situations in general in the country, the repressive military institutions. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3982.9599999999996s)]
*  So that's the common understanding. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3988.48s)]
*  Then once we are able to dismantle the current military institution, then there will be a [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3990.56s)]
*  political negotiation and it is already happening among the different diverse political actors and [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=3998.08s)]
*  ethnic groups. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4006.08s)]
*  Then we will have a security sector reform that will include the reformations of the military. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4008.0s)]
*  At the same time, the current revolution, what we have also been witnessing is that the young [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4013.6s)]
*  people of Burma, especially the Burmese young people, are not only talking about military [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4020.4s)]
*  dictatorship at this point and reinstating or replacing a new form of government, but [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4026.4s)]
*  we are talking about the eliminations or ending all forms of dictatorships. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4035.12s)]
*  Not just the military dictatorship. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4045.52s)]
*  So it's the revolution, we call it. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4047.2000000000003s)]
*  It's not just about fight against the military. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4049.92s)]
*  It's the fight against ideology around the authoritarianism or all forms of dictatorship. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4053.2s)]
*  So young people are committed to really building true democratic values, inclusive democracy, [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4059.7599999999998s)]
*  federal democracy that assure equality and justice and peace for every community and [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4069.8399999999997s)]
*  individuals in Burma. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4077.9199999999996s)]
*  So that includes, for instance, the gender equality and patriarchy and so on. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4080.0s)]
*  So that's why I think for me, I'm very optimistic in a way how far we are able to come and how far [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4088.1600000000003s)]
*  we can actually go for the future of the country. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4097.4400000000005s)]
*  It's not just about the political actors that are important in finding solutions in Burma, [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4104.08s)]
*  but also young people, the younger generations of this country who are committed to build a new [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4110.16s)]
*  future for all of us. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4119.36s)]
*  For people, again, who don't follow as closely, you're describing a much more radical [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4121.84s)]
*  and I think necessary transition to an inclusive society than the past transition to democracy or [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4126.64s)]
*  partial democracy was essentially the military maintained a lot of power and made a deal with [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4133.36s)]
*  Aung San Suu Kyi and her political party to relinquish some of that power, but it didn't [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4139.5199999999995s)]
*  entrench this military hold on a lot of the society and economy or the Buddhist nationalism [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4144.639999999999s)]
*  that was evident in the ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya that you have represented as an activist. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4154.24s)]
*  So that does speak to a moment in which the ambition in response to the coup has actually [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4161.44s)]
*  gotten greater with respect to democracy. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4167.12s)]
*  I'm interested in the situation for the Rohingya. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4170.5599999999995s)]
*  Nobody suffered more over the years in Myanmar than your community. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4174.639999999999s)]
*  First of all, do you find that there's a greater inclusivity of Rohingya in this vision of a [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4180.4s)]
*  future of Myanmar? And how much of your community remains inside those borders versus how much is [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4189.44s)]
*  in Bangladesh and in other countries? [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4197.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, right now there are about 600,000 Rohingya remain in Myanmar, inside Myanmar across different [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4200.4s)]
*  cities in Rakhine states. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4210.48s)]
*  Specifically, there are about 130,000 internally displaced Rohingya in Situ A, [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4212.64s)]
*  Tokyo and a few other cities. Outside in Bangladesh, there are approximately 1 million [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4219.04s)]
*  Rohingya living in mostly squalid refugee camps. And there are several hundred thousands in other [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4226.32s)]
*  countries like Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Indonesia, India, Pakistan, and Thailand and other [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4233.76s)]
*  neighboring countries. People are risking their life to take this very dangerous journey to [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4243.52s)]
*  find a safe haven. And the UNHCR actually said that in their report, 2023 was the deadliest [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4250.56s)]
*  year of the Rohingya sea crossing. So that's the situation on the ground. And now, with everything [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4259.52s)]
*  happening besides the humanitarian crisis and catastrophe, in the political discussions and [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4267.76s)]
*  political future, where is Rohingya lies? I do believe that until and unless we're able to secure [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4274.96s)]
*  equality and future for the Rohingya community in Burma, which is one of the most persecuted and [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4285.6s)]
*  the most, as you mentioned, the community that suffered the most, if we're not able to protect [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4291.76s)]
*  them, if we're not able to secure future for the Rohingya community and equality and equal [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4297.84s)]
*  rights of Rohingya, I don't think we'll be able to find a peaceful future or democratic future that [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4302.64s)]
*  all of us, the entire country is envisioning. For the Rohingya, it is not just that they lost [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4312.64s)]
*  the political rights and basics human rights in Burma over the past decade, but also [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4319.12s)]
*  they become actually the victims and survivors of serious international crimes, such as genocide and [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4328.56s)]
*  crimes against humanity, as was acknowledged by the UN and as well as the US government. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4336.48s)]
*  So I think that when we find a solution for the Rohingya, when we have political discussions [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4344.16s)]
*  around the Rohingya, we have to figure out, we have to actually pursue two parts. One, political [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4350.5599999999995s)]
*  dialogues and political discussions. How do we integrate, reintegrate Rohingya into the Burmese [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4358.0s)]
*  society and assure equal rights, including the political rights, which we already had in the past? [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4364.32s)]
*  At the same time, how do we bring justice and accountability and how do we repair the harm that [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4370.719999999999s)]
*  has been done to the Rohingya community? So last question here, I mean, you paint a picture of both [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4378.32s)]
*  really dire circumstances for people and violence and atrocities being committed. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4383.12s)]
*  And at the same time, there's some hope in the sense that you have this [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4388.0s)]
*  unity among different forces and this progress that's been made in fighting back. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4394.4s)]
*  The last question one asks is, what should external countries be doing? The United States, [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4398.719999999999s)]
*  obviously, what policies would you like to see the United States pursue? And I know also the [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4403.679999999999s)]
*  Southeast Asian countries, ASEAN, the bloc of Southeast Asian countries is a key actor. What [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4409.92s)]
*  would you like to see from foreign governments that could help push this in the right direction? [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4414.88s)]
*  There are many, many ways that the US government and ASEAN, the country in the regions can actually [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4419.28s)]
*  support the Burma. One, the neighboring countries should basically provide the people of Burma [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4426.32s)]
*  with more protections and more sustainable path until we are able to go back to Burma. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4436.8s)]
*  The situation in Bangladesh is so dire, the conditions in the camps become [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4444.24s)]
*  extremely concerning over the past several years. And the situation in Thailand, there is no, [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4451.04s)]
*  it's been extremely difficult for the Burmese diaspora and refugees in Thailand to obtain any [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4459.04s)]
*  kind of documentation or to be legal to be able to remain in Thailand for [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4464.88s)]
*  the meantime for a while until we are able to go back. So, all of these neighboring countries [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4473.2s)]
*  are very important for us. People of Burma need their support at this point. And the last thing [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4478.0s)]
*  we would like to see is they engage with the junta and legitimize the junta's power because [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4485.52s)]
*  that will not resolve the crisis in Burma. That will only empower the junta and exacerbate and [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4491.6s)]
*  prolong the military dictatorship and prolong the humanitarian crisis. And what we want to see from [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4499.4400000000005s)]
*  the US is US working with this strategically important country for people of Burma and [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4505.280000000001s)]
*  listen to our demands. There are so many of them, including now that Thailand is trying to [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4514.72s)]
*  do the humanitarian corridor through the Myanmar Red Cross, which is under control of military. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4520.96s)]
*  We're saying that Thailand shouldn't do it because it is, the Myanmar Red Cross is controlled by the, [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4528.24s)]
*  under the junta's authorities. Instead, Thailand should work with the civil society and [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4534.5599999999995s)]
*  stakeholders on the ground, including ethnic lead, the arms organizations and ethnic political [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4544.08s)]
*  organizations to be able to provide the humanitarian assistance to people who need it. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4549.52s)]
*  And when it's come to the Rohingya refugees, and there hasn't been any coordinated or [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbm9xVZhHU&t=4557.6s)]
