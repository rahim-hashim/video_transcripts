# Would More Ukrainian Attacks In Russia Weaken Putin or Cause an Escalation?
**Pod Save the World:** [May 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek)
*  Welcome back to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Ben Rhodes. Ben, welcome back. How's the jet lag? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=0.0s)]
*  It's um, it's rather extreme Tommy. Yeah, I was in I was in Asia. I was in Hong Kong [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  and [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=12.0s)]
*  That city's changed a bit [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=13.44s)]
*  But uh, it just gets harder with each year of age, I think [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=16.8s)]
*  Doesn't get easier like the sands of time need a dr. Ronnie [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=22.0s)]
*  Yeah, you need a MAGA congressman doctor. We knew you know, you know pushing pills everybody [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=24.96s)]
*  Yeah, you know else needs some some pills at least the upper version or the Boston Celtics [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  Well, you have to remember I'm a huge Knicks fan in the heat that are now torching your Celtics just beat the Knicks [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=34.36s)]
*  So I've experienced him being beaten with by the heat this play. Yeah. Does that mean you're rooting for the heat now? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=40.2s)]
*  Yes, it does because you know retroactively makes your team look better. That's exactly right. I look tried and true [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=46.6s)]
*  I get it also there should be no love for Boston fans if you're a New Yorker [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=51.64s)]
*  No, but we also hate the heat because we had that rivalry with the heat in the 90s [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=55.04s)]
*  But um, I don't know. I kind of like this weird team like of old guys [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=58.14s)]
*  Yeah, Jimmy Butler like as I get older [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=62.82s)]
*  I tend to like older athletes more even though they're like I think of them as older than me even though they're like 35 years old [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=65.12s)]
*  I'm like Jimmy Butler's so old, you know, yeah, you're gonna stretch in like 35, you know [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=71.4s)]
*  Kills me. Well, it's great to have you back. We have a lot to cover today [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=77.4s)]
*  We are gonna talk about the president of Ukraine's far-flung travels speaking a jet lag the latest in the war effort [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=81.48s)]
*  Including reports of saboteurs and Russia saboteurs is fun to say word [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=87.76s)]
*  How the Air Force missed multiple chances to stop the Pentagon leaker an update on Trump's classified document hoarding [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=91.92s)]
*  executions and personnel changes in Iran another tragic Pentagon drone strike [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=99.08000000000001s)]
*  AI causing chaos online and then much much more and then then you did today's interview [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=104.60000000000001s)]
*  What are folks gonna hear about? So I talked to Mark Malik Brown who's the president of the Open Society Foundation? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=109.64s)]
*  Obviously kind of the the biggest global foundation promoting [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=114.88s)]
*  Human rights and we talked about how? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=119.44s)]
*  among other things [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=122.12s)]
*  we talked about how the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=123.68s)]
*  Effort to promote human rights and civil society is more complicated today than it has been in a very long time [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=126.56s)]
*  Because of all these authoritarians and all these efforts to kind of crack down [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=132.08s)]
*  We talked about an important story Tommy that we we haven't touched on yet, which is the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=135.92s)]
*  The debt crisis that so many countries are facing [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=141.32s)]
*  Basically a topic of g7. Yeah big topic at the g7 because we talked about the g7 [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=144.96s)]
*  The challenges of America kind of talking about democracy, but then having people like Modi at the g7 [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=149.88s)]
*  this challenge of a whole bunch of developing countries and middle-income countries that [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=154.98s)]
*  Just totally squeezed by the combination of kovat and high interest rates and all kinds of stuff that is risking default like [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=160.28s)]
*  Mark was just in Kenya and they're not paying salaries to government employees. Like this is happening now [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=167.36s)]
*  And then what are the bright spots out there? What can we learn from some of the stuff that's going well in terms of beating back? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=172.2s)]
*  Populism and autocracy he was just in Brazil. So talked about what he saw there [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=178.84s)]
*  so it's a it's a really good conversation about the current state of the effort to promote democracy and [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=182.4s)]
*  Civil society. Generally excellent. We might need his been to do a little more work here. Yeah. Well that too, you know [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=188.72s)]
*  We actually interestingly I talked a bit the end about how the demonization of George Soros here [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=194.0s)]
*  Yes impacts their work globally because Elon Musk had just tweeted [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=198.72s)]
*  Something like George Soros is committed to destroying civilization or something [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=202.72s)]
*  So we talked a bit about the Soros conspiracy theory. Yeah, the Elan's just lost his mind [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=206.44s)]
*  All right. So a lot of news this week on the Ukraine front [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=211.52s)]
*  President Zelensky has been popping up everywhere [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=214.20000000000002s)]
*  He's like the Ukrainian Carmen San Diego. He went to how dated is that Joe Carmen San Diego think that's on anymore [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=216.74s)]
*  I mean, it's it's in your my house. No, okay [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=222.82000000000002s)]
*  Well, we'll work on that. So as Zelensky went to Saudi Arabia, he delivered a speech at the Arab League's meeting [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=225.9s)]
*  I get why Zelensky will go anywhere and talk to anyone [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=231.9s)]
*  But the fact that he had to deliver a speech before the Arab League in an audience that included Syrian President Bashar [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=236.5s)]
*  Al-Assad who was in power because the Russians and the Wagner group in particular [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=243.62s)]
*  Propped him up and committed war crimes on his behalf for the last decade is [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=247.94s)]
*  truly appalling [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=251.98000000000002s)]
*  Yeah [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=253.58s)]
*  This is such a crazy world a week [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=255.42000000000002s)]
*  You know, maybe it's because I was in withdrawal last week too, but like this meeting itself was fascinating [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=258.18s)]
*  So I know we'll get to elements of Ukraine around the g7 [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=263.38s)]
*  But like this was the first meeting in which they were gonna bring Assad back into the Arab League fold [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=267.18s)]
*  Essentially full normalization of Bashar al-Assad. It's like it never happened. There he is [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=272.82s)]
*  It's been building for a while as we talked about and I have to say like MBS Mohammed Salman [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=277.9s)]
*  he's the you know, he was the host of this meeting in Saudi Arabia, but he's also kind of the king of the Arab League to [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=283.62s)]
*  They they played this pretty interesting [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=291.26s)]
*  This is not praise for Mohammed Salman, but like it is [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=293.98s)]
*  Like there's something that he does that is pretty clever which is he balances, you know [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=297.34s)]
*  He doesn't give any side everything they want but he gives everybody a little bit of something [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=302.94s)]
*  Yeah [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=306.3s)]
*  and he kind of operates as this free agent between the China Russia block in the the US Western block and [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=306.82s)]
*  So he had to know that Assad going there was going to get a lot of negative attention in the West [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=312.7s)]
*  Was gonna call into question whether they're fully embracing Russia because I saw this kind of Russia's guy like Trojan horse in the Arab League [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=318.26s)]
*  And I think very consciously he's like, you know what I could do [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=324.38s)]
*  The only thing I could do to kind of counterbalance that is have Zelensky [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=328.24s)]
*  Here is kind of the avatar of the West, you know and give him a big platform [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=333.02s)]
*  And it was interesting in that regard is MBS sending a message to both sides China and the US. Hey, I'm I'm [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=338.14s)]
*  I'm gonna get my best deal wherever it is and I'm gonna play both sides of this thing [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=345.54s)]
*  The lens get that was interesting he did call out some people in the room for kind of not siding with Ukraine for [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=350.38s)]
*  You know, he showed some guts like he didn't just go and kiss the ring as it were like [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=357.9s)]
*  And I think what he knows is the Saudis and the Emiratis have a lot of cash [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=363.26s)]
*  Not only could that support, you know things like Ukrainian reconstruction [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=368.02s)]
*  But that they talked to the Russians and who knows where this war is going and we've seen the Saudis involved in prisoner exchanges [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=371.58s)]
*  Zalensky said maybe you could do something like that again. So whether we like it or not and I don't think you and I love it [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=378.38s)]
*  This is a sign that the Saudis and the Emiratis are players and are gonna stay players [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=384.53999999999996s)]
*  And let's be honest [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=388.97999999999996s)]
*  It's probably smart of Zelensky to have a direct relationship with the Saudis and not go through United States anymore because that relationship is up [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=389.88s)]
*  Good point. It's good point. So then so Zelensky goes [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=396.85999999999996s)]
*  Although it should be noted that Jake Sullivan was in [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=399.97999999999996s)]
*  Saudi like a week or so before this. Yeah, Jake's been doing a lot of mop up. Yeah [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=402.85999999999996s)]
*  So you wonder London figure out this f-16 thing. He had to go meet with the Chinese in Vienna [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=407.06s)]
*  I think for eight hours then he went to the Saudi. So he's been doing a lot of work [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=411.76s)]
*  So Zelensky goes from the Arab League to the G7 a surprise appearance in Japan [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=415.7s)]
*  This trip was orchestrated apparently by President Macron of France who sent a French jet to get Zelensky in Poland [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=421.54s)]
*  Flying to Japan in his speech Zelensky compared the total destruction of bakmut [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=427.66s)]
*  To the aftermath of the US dropping a nuclear bomb on Hiroshima [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=432.74s)]
*  I'm genuinely curious sort of how that played in you know to Japanese audiences given the scale of destruction from a nuclear weapon [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=436.26s)]
*  But anyway, the G7 leaders themselves rolled out new sanctions on Russia [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=443.62s)]
*  They celebrated the success of this American-led effort to set a cap on the price of Russian oil [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=447.94s)]
*  Which stabilized supply while reducing Russia's revenues? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=453.18s)]
*  But the big headline was about Biden's policy change on providing x-16s [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=456.90000000000003s)]
*  To Ukraine so the US is now going to train Ukrainian pilots to fly the f-16 [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=462.34000000000003s)]
*  Longer term we will work with allies like Poland and the Netherlands to facilitate the transfer of x-f-16s to Ukraine [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=467.98s)]
*  This training is going to take about four months [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=475.06s)]
*  So the f-16s will not be part of this spring offensive, which is now a summer offensive [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=477.06s)]
*  I guess Ben [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=481.3s)]
*  I'm sure a lot of listeners are wondering kind of like what happened here like I have whiplash on this one again, too [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=482.38s)]
*  What got them from no to yes? I talked some folks in the White House and it's clear that [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=487.78000000000003s)]
*  This is a recognition that this war is not ending anytime soon [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=492.3s)]
*  That long term even if the Russians stopped fighting right now [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=495.90000000000003s)]
*  Ukraine needs a modern air force to defend its borders in terms of the escalation risk [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=500.1s)]
*  Politico reported that the administration has basically decided that Russia responds to new weapon systems [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=504.54s)]
*  Primarily with rhetoric, but they haven't seen you know, it's sort of the worst-case scenarios [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=511.5s)]
*  We talked about so I don't know then what'd you make of this move was this inevitable for a long time? I [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=515.58s)]
*  Mean it started to feel inevitable after the tank thing because you know [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=519.98s)]
*  We went through this with long-range artillery the high mars [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=524.9399999999999s)]
*  Then we went through with the tanks and there was this pattern of like [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=527.9399999999999s)]
*  Kind of almost making the Ukrainians work for it and justify it in order to get people comfortable with it [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=531.5s)]
*  I mean, well, first of all, I was gonna ask you like don't you think the chrome loved the Zelensky flying around? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=537.8199999999999s)]
*  These summits in a friend in their bus. Yeah. Yeah [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=542.9s)]
*  I have to say like the sequencing of this [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=546.06s)]
*  was really interesting to play back in your head and and I have to say like pretty impressive because if you look at where by [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=550.0999999999999s)]
*  presumably by the Ukrainians and the US and you know, the other staunch Ukrainian supporters in Europe because [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=559.02s)]
*  You know, we've covered for the last kind of month [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=565.0999999999999s)]
*  First of all, it's a Lensky's travel. He went to the Netherlands, right? Which is a key f16 country [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=567.9s)]
*  They'd be doing some the training may be providing he went to Poland [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=573.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, also like a key country for doing training and providing f16s [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=575.92s)]
*  Then he went to Germany. Well, Italy Germany France UK [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=581.04s)]
*  Clearly there was like an effort to kind of bring everybody along who's gonna be a part of this [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=585.88s)]
*  You seem at checkers with Rishi Sunak. Yeah, I think Boris Johnson wanted that picture Rishi tries so hard though [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=590.8s)]
*  He takes off the jacket he does like that this that skinny shirt with the skinny tie and like he just looks like not [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=597.04s)]
*  As cool as Lensky, you know, it looks like the kid is like glad to be at the lunch table [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=603.36s)]
*  But so like they clearly sequence this in a way to kind of bring everybody along and kind of create this [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=608.44s)]
*  Momentum that would crescendo at the g7 and I think that was pretty well done. Now. What does it really mean? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=613.8s)]
*  I [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=619.52s)]
*  Agree with you. So you're right. I think this is not for this offensive. It's for a long-term fight [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=621.28s)]
*  I guess the thing I'd add to it is on the escalation risk [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=627.04s)]
*  You know what you really worry about is the f16 is a weapon that they could use [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=629.96s)]
*  To attack Russia in Russia, right? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=633.84s)]
*  And so in practice you would probably get shot down immediately by like an s-400 missile defense system, right? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=635.84s)]
*  Like nobody's flying into the others airspace at the moment because you will just get smoked you get smoked [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=642.16s)]
*  But like I think like the two things are for escalation are like well the Russians respond just because we provided them this weapon [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=646.56s)]
*  Or might the Ukrainians do something with this weapon that that you know, we would be worried about [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=653.26s)]
*  And so in a way it's a signal not just that this war is gonna go on and they're gonna need this stuff [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=658.5s)]
*  Into next year and beyond for safe skies or safer skies [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=663.06s)]
*  Over Ukraine, but it's kind of a vote of trust in the Ukrainians to not [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=667.38s)]
*  Do something, you know with this weapon that would be beyond what we're comfortable with [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=672.58s)]
*  And so, you know, I think that's a positive sign I guess that that the Biden team feels a degree of trust in the Ukrainians [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=677.54s)]
*  We're gonna probably talk about this some of these border cross-border texts in Russia that might test that [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=683.98s)]
*  But yeah, they clearly wanted this g7 to kind of be a moment of momentum [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=690.82s)]
*  The f16s and new sanctions some new money all this diplomatic offensive. It's kind of the last piece before this [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=696.34s)]
*  Springs last summer offensive. Yeah, maybe yeah that they could do diplomatically and maybe it's kind of lowering expectations a bit [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=704.56s)]
*  Because then you can start to say well, they got the f16s coming in the fall, you know [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=711.5999999999999s)]
*  Like it's a way to kind of take some of the heat off this offensive [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=715.6999999999999s)]

*  Imaginable there's a long piece in New Yorker out right now by a guy named Luke [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=937.76s)]
*  Mogelson who spent I think two weeks on the front lines in eastern Ukraine [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=941.3s)]
*  And if you really want to understand what this war is like in practice, I suggest reading it. It sounds like a living hell [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=944.6999999999999s)]
*  The Pentagon meanwhile said they found another three billion in initial [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=950.7s)]
*  For Ukraine after an accounting error that only building in the world where you could find three billion dollars billion dollars [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=955.74s)]
*  I'm sure that won't lead to any theories or founded, you know conspiracy theories [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=960.9s)]
*  So what you mentioned then so the other news that happened this week is an armed group launched an attack inside Russia in the city [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=965.26s)]
*  Of Belgarod, which is right on the border a group called the free Russia Legion took credit for this assault [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=972.02s)]
*  They said Ukraine was aware of their actions, but not behind them [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=979.1s)]
*  Regardless there were days of soldiers running around a Russian city in heavily armored vehicles [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=983.74s)]
*  Shortly before we started recording Russia said they killed I think all of them at 70 people they ended this incursion [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=990.38s)]
*  So, I don't know. This is like the tenth time this has happened [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=996.22s)]
*  You can't really tell who's behind this stuff, but I know I've seen some people suggest [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=998.66s)]
*  Maybe this is the kind of splashy thing you do to distract before a big offensive [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1002.74s)]
*  Maybe not maybe we're thinking too hard now. I don't know. What was your take on this? I think I have a tours [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1008.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's really interesting [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1012.8399999999999s)]
*  You know these guys claim to be essentially kind of the Russian resistance, right? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1014.8399999999999s)]
*  So they and claim I don't you know plausibly claim that they are [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1019.1999999999999s)]
*  Russians who want to help Ukraine because they hate the war and they want to [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1024.36s)]
*  Destabilize the Russian political system and they want to take attention away from the front into Russia [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1028.44s)]
*  Interestingly that in the command structure of Ukraine they fall under this umbrella of like the Foreign Legion we've talked about so [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1034.5600000000002s)]
*  There's Americans fighting in that there's there's Brits fighting in that so [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1041.48s)]
*  They were careful to say they weren't directed by Ukraine, but that is a part of the Ukrainian [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1047.0s)]
*  Structure and the Ukrainians didn't act like they didn't know about it [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1052.92s)]
*  I think the main thing for me is yeah [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1055.8400000000001s)]
*  Could be tied to the offensive and try to distract the Russians [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1059.4s)]
*  But I I've said this a couple times before the longer this war goes on [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1062.76s)]
*  I think the more the Ukrainians are gonna do stuff inside of Russia [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1067.24s)]
*  Because it's the natural impulse to want to lash out and as we talked about [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1069.88s)]
*  Carbomb assassinations [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1073.96s)]
*  pipeline and infrastructure attacks [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1076.0400000000002s)]
*  Things have blown up in Crimea. Oh, you know, that's not Russia. Obviously, that's Ukraine [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1078.3600000000001s)]
*  But the Russia sees it that way and so to me it does speak to this kind of variable in the war [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1082.88s)]
*  Which is what happens if there's more and more of these attacks inside of Russia? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1088.46s)]
*  Might that be the thing that triggers some escalation by the Russians or might it actually really start to weaken Putin at home [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1092.7s)]
*  Pergosian to your point like used it to attack the Russian military. Look how weak the military is so kind of played into [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1101.22s)]
*  The the far right and that the people that are to to Putin's right somehow in Russia [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1109.02s)]
*  Talking about how this is, you know outrageous that the military could let this happen like the drone over the Kremlin [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1114.3400000000001s)]
*  so I think we're gonna see more of this and [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1119.7800000000002s)]
*  And it's just it's a it to me. It's one of the most interesting variables in the war [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1123.98s)]
*  Because it's the one thing that could be you know, not a game-changer [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1128.74s)]
*  But at least something that causes the Russians to think differently [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1132.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah for sure speaking of the the finding three billion dollars in the budget [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1136.2600000000002s)]
*  60 minutes is a great piece this week or this Sunday this past Sunday [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1140.14s)]
*  I think about military contractor price gouging that is worth watching [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1143.74s)]
*  It's a six-month investigation and to us, you know paying ten grand for a part that NASA pays $200 for so, you know [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1148.3400000000001s)]
*  These debt ceiling talks are happening. No one's talking about the Pentagon budget [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1154.7800000000002s)]
*  Well, at least it's not the focus of attention or where cuts would be if the Republicans had their way [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1158.5800000000002s)]
*  But there seems to be some fat there [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1164.0600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and you know the thing is the the better proposal around when the Republicans started to talk about defunding the Ukrainian stuff and [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1165.9s)]
*  And the last year there was a proposal for like an inspector general of this. Yeah, that's a good idea [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1174.9s)]
*  I I don't I mean I get that the by administration like [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1180.5600000000002s)]
*  You know, the executive branch is always reluctant to have added oversight and accountability [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1185.9s)]
*  But like it seems like that's not a bad place for this to land [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1190.6000000000001s)]
*  Especially if we're gonna have to provide this for a longer time like having some kind of special [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1193.38s)]
*  IG or you know, we used to have this around Iraq and Afghanistan funding to me that makes sense [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1199.5800000000002s)]
*  Did you it seems like you were watching Zelensky's? [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1205.38s)]
*  Social media I will say it's funny you mentioned Rishi the contrast of the personalities between all of Schultz [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1209.0600000000002s)]
*  McCrone and [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1215.6200000000001s)]
*  Rishi Sunak with Zalensky because like all of Schultz is like super businesslike [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1216.9s)]
*  You know, he's just like walking through hallways with the guy [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1220.98s)]
*  McCrone is like very emotional and he he's always got like a hand draped on his shoulder and you know [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1223.8200000000002s)]
*  Do you look anguished? He looks anguished and but like and then Rishi just looks like this guy [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1229.54s)]
*  It's really funny window in the European leaders, I love it. I love it [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1236.5800000000002s)]
*  Okay, so in some non-ukrain g7 news speaking of like the awkward family photos [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1240.5s)]
*  The leaders talked a lot about debt restructuring as you mentioned the top end and how to make institutions like the World Bank [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1245.14s)]
*  Work or work at all for countries in the global south who need assistance [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1250.72s)]
*  They talked a lot about China including China's unfair economic practices [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1254.68s)]
*  Making supply chains more resilient in the event of economic pressure by China or Russia for example, you know [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1259.04s)]
*  Biden team wants to get other countries to make semiconductors so that the Chinese can't surround Taiwan cut off the world supply of [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1266.84s)]
*  semiconductors and cause a huge crisis [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1274.72s)]
*  President Biden was able to get some buy-in from g7 countries for US export controls that prevent the sale of certain technologies the China [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1277.08s)]
*  The Chinese were not thrilled about this focus [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1284.96s)]
*  But still Biden seemed bullish about talking to Chinese President Xi Jinping soon [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1288.1200000000001s)]
*  There's nothing scheduled nothing announced, but they haven't talked since the spy balloon incident looming over this whole summit [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1292.92s)]
*  was the debt ceiling standoff back in Washington and [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1298.44s)]
*  Concerned that our idiotic politics would tank the global economy. President Biden had to cut his trip short [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1301.6000000000001s)]
*  He canceled a visit to Papua New Guinea in Australia [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1306.48s)]
*  It would have been the first US presidential visit to Papua New Guinea leaders from 17 other countries were planning to go to Papua New Guinea [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1308.8s)]
*  For a big meeting so it wasn't just this like one bilateral trip. It was a much bigger thing in Australia [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1315.8400000000001s)]
*  Biden was supposed to meet with the quad which is what nerds call meetings between the US Japan India and Australia [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1322.1200000000001s)]
*  Then this is the second time in a decade that Republicans have manufactured a crisis that forced the president United States [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1327.96s)]
*  This time Biden the last time Obama to cancel a foreign trip [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1335.0s)]
*  October 2013 was when Obama had to skip a major summit in Asia [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1339.96s)]
*  How do you quantify the cost of a cancellation like that of our politics just making us look like incompetent? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1343.8s)]
*  So I think this one is pretty bad and look it was bad in 2013 [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1351.64s)]
*  I don't think it was as bad because first of all the summer was in Brunei, which is a bit problematic the Sultan there [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1355.76s)]
*  Not no friend of that he owned a bunch of hotels in LA. Yeah the Polo lounge over, you know Beverly Hills [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1362.64s)]
*  But but here's why this is bad in this context [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1369.32s)]
*  first of all [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1373.72s)]
*  The whole point of this Asia strategy is to kind of counter China, right? That's no secret, right? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1375.32s)]
*  China's message to all of these countries whether it's the Pacific Island countries where they're throwing about around a lot of money and leverage [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1382.6000000000001s)]
*  Or even the Australia's and Japan's of the world is [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1389.36s)]
*  Hey, you least know who we are. We're we are who we are Xi Jinping's present for life [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1392.96s)]
*  We may be bullies, but like you kind of know the terms or transactional, right? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1398.76s)]
*  The Americans in the Chinese argument the Americans are dysfunctional you can't trust them [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1405.1599999999999s)]
*  They break agreements or they go from Obama to Trump to Biden [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1409.8s)]
*  The thing they say now might be different to yours from now and so the reason this is damaging is the cancellation is [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1413.36s)]
*  Entirely consistent with the Chinese there. There's like see you see like they're so just we've been telling you democracy is dysfunctional [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1422.36s)]
*  And this is they're so dysfunctional that they're putting the whole global economy risk because the dollars are reserved currency with the Chinese [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1428.36s)]
*  Don't also like and so that's a problem and in places like the Pacific Islands [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1434.54s)]
*  I would hope Biden would go back because to plan some big summit and raise expectations and not show up [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1439.6000000000001s)]
*  I think is quite damaging and the Chinese will make good use of that, you know [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1445.0600000000002s)]
*  She doesn't get extorted by the Paula burrow standing committee. Yeah, exactly [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1450.48s)]
*  He doesn't have a Kevin McCarthy and I'd rather live in a democracy [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1454.48s)]
*  even if it means we have Kevin McCarthy, but because the other thing is that the g7 they [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1458.38s)]
*  They came to some common ground on China [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1462.52s)]
*  But like there are some real differences between the US and Europe on China and these export controls you talk about are a big part [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1464.56s)]
*  Of it because the US is essentially trying to deny [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1469.8799999999999s)]
*  inputs into the Chinese economy [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1473.56s)]
*  So certain technologies are restricted from going to China but increasingly also certain investments, right? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1475.12s)]
*  Like you they don't want investment from the US or Europe [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1480.72s)]
*  to be going into certain Chinese sectors and [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1483.96s)]
*  Europe has a lot of businesses that do a lot of stuff in China [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1486.68s)]
*  And so they're kind of going along reluctantly with some of this and again to see the United States like [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1490.28s)]
*  Telling them you have to tell you have to take a hit at home and you have to tell your companies that they can't invest [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1496.56s)]
*  In China anymore. Oh, and by the way, then we had to rush home to stop [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1501.9199999999998s)]
*  The US economy from defaulting. It just it's a it is a problem and it's not it's ultimately [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1506.1599999999999s)]
*  It's a Republicans fault not Joe Biden's but we shouldn't pretend like this doesn't matter. Yeah, it's totally dysfunctional [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1512.04s)]
*  I'm sure these countries were like look if my choice is you default on your debt or you cancel this trip like cancel the trip [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1516.72s)]
*  It's like that's an absurd choice to have to make for Joe Biden. Yeah [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1522.64s)]
*  Okay, so then in back home speaking of dysfunction [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1526.4s)]
*  We are learning more about just how badly the Air Force screwed up when it comes to protecting classified information [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1529.48s)]
*  And that massive League of Pentagon documents by a 21 year old IT specialist named Jack Tishara [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1535.04s)]
*  Prosecutors say Tishara was reprimanded on two separate occasions for mishandling classified information in September 2022 [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1541.4s)]
*  He was observed taking notes on classified intelligence and putting those notes in his pocket [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1548.6000000000001s)]
*  Then a month later to share I got in trouble because he attended a classified briefing and started asking detailed questions [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1554.48s)]
*  The IT guy was in a class [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1561.6000000000001s)]
*  Asking questions then there was a third incident where Tishara was caught looking at intelligence not related to his duties [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1564.5200000000002s)]
*  but he wasn't reprimanded then like I think back to our days at the White House and how like [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1570.56s)]
*  Anxious I would feel asking to get read into something or to see a document or to be a part of a meeting and how closely [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1577.3999999999999s)]
*  Held we pretend you could be asked to leave meetings. Oh, yeah situation all the time [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1583.12s)]
*  Like absolutely have to skinny down to like some super red and get a real meaning after the meeting [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1586.6s)]
*  Yeah, like I think we both when we heard about this story [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1591.32s)]
*  We're like how did the Air Force not like have ways to monitor what this guy was looking at now [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1593.96s)]
*  It seems like in fact, it's worse than that. They caught him and they just failed to do anything about it [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1598.5s)]
*  Yeah [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1604.04s)]
*  I mean I have to tell you that this whole thing has really made me realize that there's a much deeper cultural problem [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1604.26s)]
*  Because clearly the the Air Force in this case [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1610.62s)]
*  But you have to kind of think this might be going on in other, you know branches of military [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1613.82s)]
*  Or the intelligence community like if you're in their tent, you're just gonna in you're wandering around [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1618.38s)]
*  You can read whatever you want. You can take notes on stuff [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1622.28s)]
*  I mean, these are the reddest of red flags that this guy was exhibiting [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1624.44s)]
*  And this does know the need for like a pretty massive cultural shift [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1628.28s)]
*  Like we said, you're not gonna plug every leak, but this one didn't seem like you needed, you know [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1632.6s)]
*  George smiley or inspector Clouseau to like uncover the fucking mole here. I mean [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1638.24s)]
*  right before we started taping [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1643.52s)]
*  Ashley from our team sent around a clip where the head of the German foreign intelligence was complaining that it's hard to recruit [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1645.56s)]
*  Because his recruits want to work from home and they can't take their personal self [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1651.44s)]
*  There is a broader yeah challenging cultural shift happening [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1656.08s)]
*  But related to the to share a story that CNN had a depressing piece last week about efforts to identify and root out [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1658.9599999999998s)]
*  Extremists in the military it was called the countering extremism working group [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1664.76s)]
*  it was quietly abandoned because of Republican attacks of the military is woke and [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1668.6s)]
*  We have long known that the military has a big far-right extremism problem in its ranks the Department of Homeland Security in 2009 [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1673.2399999999998s)]
*  When we were in the White House talked about this how veterans were prone to getting recruited by these groups [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1680.0s)]
*  Republicans attacked us Janet Napolitano had to walk it back. That was shameful [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1685.4799999999998s)]
*  We shouldn't have done that [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1689.2399999999998s)]
*  Yeah [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1690.1999999999998s)]
*  but like fast forward a few years and I saw an analysis that found 15% of the January 6 insurrectionists had prior military experience [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1690.3999999999999s)]
*  So it's clearly like there's there's a problem and it's not going away [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1698.28s)]
*  And there were some act like recently over the course last week to like the first active duty person [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1702.08s)]
*  Got prosecuted for January 6. I mean, there's a real problem here and [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1708.1999999999998s)]
*  Look some of this is just you know demographic right like it's [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1713.4s)]
*  Young white men, you know young white men from certain parts of the country [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1718.5600000000002s)]
*  They're super conservative going military and it military is an institution with millions of people [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1722.16s)]
*  So the kind of extremism we see in society is going to be right represent military. However, you know [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1726.3600000000001s)]
*  highly trained [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1733.0800000000002s)]
*  You know armed people [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1734.76s)]
*  Who you know also in extreme circumstances it might make them more prone to radicalization [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1737.56s)]
*  So this has clearly been like an elephant in the room of the conversation about extremism for some time [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1742.84s)]
*  We've talked about in the context of like the Navy SEAL community that Eddie Gallagher came out of the war criminal [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1748.8s)]
*  but [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1756.16s)]
*  Part of what I think the Republicans do in constantly attacking the military for being woke because of things like, you know openness to transgender participation [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1757.36s)]
*  It's kind of projection to like some of its like [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1766.0800000000002s)]
*  Oh, they can score political points on something that the military did that feels woke [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1768.72s)]
*  But I think part of it is to kind of keep the attention in that direction [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1772.2s)]
*  There's not some problem in the military with it being woke [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1775.8400000000001s)]
*  There's there's not some issue where like the US military is not carrying out its functions because it's woke if anything [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1778.3200000000002s)]
*  This is more corrosive because the US military in addition to this being a threat to the broader extremism picture in the United States [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1783.64s)]
*  Is a big diverse institution and I feel bad for people who have to serve with like white nationalist lunatics in the military [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1790.08s)]
*  That's what we should be feeling bad for. Yeah [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1797.72s)]
*  The coheed yeah, if you're like the only you know black male in a member of a unit where there's a bunch of like [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1799.8s)]
*  Jack Tishara's who are posting videos of themselves saying the n-word and anti-semitic slurs and firing guns [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1804.84s)]
*  You would be scared for your life. Yeah, and can you imagine how much of that there is? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1811.1799999999998s)]
*  I mean, it's they should be setting up [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1814.82s)]
*  I hope they are a kind of reporting channels for people to raise this and not trying to turn this into like I mean [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1817.1599999999999s)]
*  Look some military like the language is probably not perfect all the time. I get it, right? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1821.82s)]
*  But this is something that I think is gonna continue to be with us and precise because it's hard to have a conversation in open [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1825.9599999999998s)]
*  Politics about this. It's something that the military itself is gonna have to handle in house. Absolutely. Absolutely [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1832.26s)]
*  Speaking of classified information [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1838.0s)]
*  We learned an intriguing new detail about the investigation of President Trump's hoarding of classified information [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1839.36s)]
*  The New York Times reported that prosecutors have issued a subpoena for information about Trump's business dealings in foreign countries since he took office [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1844.3999999999999s)]
*  That includes a request for quotes from the New York Times [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1852.1599999999999s)]
*  Details on the Trump Organization's real estate licensing and development dealings in seven countries China France Turkey Saudi Arabia Kuwait [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1854.84s)]
*  The UAE in Oman starts in 2017 when he took office [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1862.12s)]
*  Previously we heard that prosecutors wanted details about Trump's dealings with the Saudi owned to live golf tour [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1866.36s)]
*  Maybe the same thing here up Ben [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1871.88s)]
*  Clearly these guys are looking into any connection between Trump taking these documents in foreign dealings [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1874.48s)]
*  I'm struggling with whether this is an obvious investigative step whether there's smoke there's fire [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1879.3600000000001s)]
*  What's your take with the caveat that we're both totally speculating? [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1886.48s)]
*  I mean with the fact that you have four Gulf countries on this thing [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1890.48s)]
*  Saudi Arabia UAE Oman [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1896.92s)]
*  You know it suggests to me that that everything we've been talking about [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1899.74s)]
*  You know is coming to play here, which is it if they're kind of looking at [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1904.18s)]
*  his conduct [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1908.66s)]
*  Round Mar-a-Lago around corruption around what may be in these documents or who may have been sharing it with [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1910.66s)]
*  the most obvious corruption, you know Trump tends to be corrupt and commit crimes in public and like [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1917.54s)]
*  There's so much money being pumped into Trump properties from Saudi Arabia and the UAE in these countries [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1922.74s)]
*  That I don't know how you don't end up looking in this direction [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1930.18s)]
*  And the reality is if you have like an empowered special counsel [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1933.02s)]
*  Who doesn't like this stuff and you start pulling these threads like you're gonna find all kinds of stuff [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1936.26s)]
*  Yeah, it does sound like it's creating some [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1941.66s)]
*  The internal lawyers are quitting left and right from from Trump's team [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1944.34s)]
*  Are quitting left and right from from Trump's team they're all blaming Boris Epstein from obstructing them [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1949.26s)]
*  Who's sort of like the in-house counsel been a previous life? [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1954.1s)]
*  He was like the surrogate booking guy at the White House or the marble-mouthed idiot [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1956.9399999999998s)]
*  Propagandist and the good thing that could come out of this is like this may not stop him from becoming president [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1960.8999999999999s)]
*  I'm not ready to put Jack Smith the special counsel on a Superman suit [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1965.3s)]
*  No, I mean Bob Mueller, but like if this can [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1968.34s)]
*  help blunt this kind of [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1972.1s)]
*  Growing snowball of corruption from places like Saudi Arabia and American politics like that could be good [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1974.98s)]
*  Yeah, that could be good [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1980.7s)]
*  And also we I think some of the recent focus groups that Washington Post did found that people are sort of aware of the corruption [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1981.58s)]
*  Cases and don't like them or the investigations [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1986.3s)]
*  Two stories out of Iran Ben [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1988.74s)]
*  So first the Iranian government executed three men who were sentenced in connection with last year's anti-government [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1990.06s)]
*  protests after the murder of a young Iranian woman named Masa Amini [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1995.66s)]
*  Amnesty International says these men were tortured into making false confessions [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=1999.22s)]
*  Iran has executed seven protesters since last December [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2003.3s)]
*  This dozens more have been charged capital offenses or sentenced to death also in Iran on Monday [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2007.14s)]
*  Iran's supreme leader fired the country's top national security official. This guy's name is Ali Shamkhani [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2012.78s)]
*  He was until recently the secretary of the Supreme National Council, which handles security and foreign policy [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2018.5s)]
*  I think sort of the US National Security Advisor equivalent [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2023.98s)]
*  He led the effort to restore ties with Saudi Arabia the New York Times said [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2026.8600000000001s)]
*  Shamkhani was pushed out after his deputy was executed after charges that he spied for the British government [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2031.5800000000002s)]
*  He was accused of corruption failing to get Iran back into the Iran nuclear agreement [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2038.5s)]
*  That was sort of an interesting one and that his replacement is some sort of military leader with no experience in diplomacy [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2042.38s)]
*  So not great all around [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2048.2200000000003s)]
*  Had you like to be that guy who you know, it's not a comfortable place to probably be in retirement [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2050.46s)]
*  you know, you've been fired as I mean look I [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2055.5s)]
*  I [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2058.22s)]
*  Obviously in the internal matters that they're dug in they're gonna crack down [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2059.8199999999997s)]
*  It's it's tragic and I don't think it's gonna make the opposition to the regime go away [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2064.54s)]
*  It's just that how they were flexibly deal with it [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2069.7799999999997s)]
*  It does feel like things are on steady there [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2072.2999999999997s)]
*  And again the variable we've talked about the nuclear issue and how far along they are with the nuclear program [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2074.62s)]
*  The other variable that we haven't talked about in a little bit is the supreme leaders health like he's old [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2079.3399999999997s)]
*  Sure, and it feels like underneath him. It's not kind of clear where the power is going [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2083.2599999999998s)]
*  And and so the possibility of there being a vacuum that is filled [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2087.98s)]
*  Probably by like the hardline military types in the aftermath supreme leader is is quite high [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2093.18s)]
*  but that's something to watch like [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2099.02s)]
*  geopolitical variables like a [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2101.46s)]
*  We talked about the internal instability but like a leadership, you know transition in Iran could be quite a mess. Absolutely [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2103.2599999999998s)]
*  Another story out of the military here. So US military officials are walking back [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2110.22s)]
*  Previous claims that a US drone strike in Syria killed a senior al-qaeda leader a bunch of analysts experts humanitarian groups in the region [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2114.74s)]
*  Say that the May 3rd strike in Syria by the Pentagon actually killed a 56 year old man named Lotfi Hassan Misto [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2122.22s)]
*  Who had no ties to extremist groups and was literally just like tending to his sheep when he was killed [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2129.22s)]
*  Misto is a father of ten then the last time there was [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2134.2599999999998s)]
*  Reporting like this about you know [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2138.7s)]
*  A disastrously wrong drone strike was two years ago when the Pentagon mistakenly killed ten members of an Afghan family in Kabul [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2140.66s)]
*  They thought they were targeting an ISIS K member connected to the attack outside the Kabul Airport [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2148.58s)]
*  After incidents like this there is often an after-action report. There's [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2154.3s)]
*  Conversations about you know biases that led them to take a strike when they shouldn't and ignore [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2161.06s)]
*  Information that would have dissuaded them from from moving forward [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2166.34s)]
*  Maybe there's some changes at the targeting process [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2171.1400000000003s)]
*  There is very rarely accountability and I do think in this case it will be important to watch and see if something [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2173.2200000000003s)]
*  changes here because [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2180.58s)]
*  I think [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2182.58s)]
*  This isn't something that happened in the fog of war it doesn't sound like doesn't sound like there was some imminent threat [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2185.46s)]
*  Yeah, and someone who reacting, you know [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2189.98s)]
*  Quickly it sounds like they just got the wrong guy [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2193.08s)]
*  They had all the time in the world to collect information and they just killed an innocent person and that just cannot happen [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2196.92s)]
*  It just can't and part of the reason why [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2202.92s)]
*  Is that if they can make a mistake in that circumstance? [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2206.2799999999997s)]
*  Once like that it calls into question all the strikes they take right? [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2212.3199999999997s)]
*  I mean if you have the opportunity kind of observe something for a while and [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2215.92s)]
*  You're just this wrong about who the person is I mean [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2219.4s)]
*  Afghanistan was a complete [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2222.8s)]
*  tragedy and catastrophe [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2225.12s)]
*  It was at least as you say it was like a dynamic situation. It was you know [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2227.04s)]
*  After an attack, you know trying to prevent another attack that appeared imminent [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2233.6s)]
*  If you can demonstrate accountability and kind of corrective measures that you're taking after something like this [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2238.36s)]
*  Then then how can people have confidence that future strikes in in Syria are not you know similarly compromised so [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2243.54s)]
*  They need to [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2251.66s)]
*  Accountability is a question or at least also like explaining how you could have got this wrong [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2253.2599999999998s)]
*  But it does call the question just how long we're gonna be using this tool is drone or drone strikes [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2260.02s)]
*  And this is where I felt, you know the Obama record and we've talked about this in the past [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2265.1s)]
*  The one thing I'd say is like what I always felt the most uncomfortable about [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2270.3s)]
*  Was to kind of open-ended nature of this thing [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2274.26s)]
*  Let me one thing to say like we're gonna use drones for a couple years to till we you know [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2276.28s)]
*  The al-qaeda threat is reduced to this level [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2280.38s)]
*  Or till Congress [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2283.26s)]
*  Withdraws it authorization for the use of force [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2285.6200000000003s)]
*  Here we are like a decade later, you know, and and it seems like this is just an open-ended thing [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2289.46s)]
*  Yeah, and you know more I think about this [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2294.1000000000004s)]
*  I guess this was sort of in the time period where there was an attack on that US base in Syria [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2295.7000000000003s)]
*  So maybe they thought maybe this was associated with that but still I mean it I think the yeah [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2301.1s)]
*  You're right still. Yeah. No, you're right hands that like we shouldn't be getting these things [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2306.78s)]
*  The point still stands and also that's a sign of like does that mean [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2310.54s)]
*  You know [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2314.9s)]
*  Should we be relaxing? [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2316.7400000000002s)]
*  all of our [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2318.9s)]
*  Like I don't know what happened here but like if if what happened and that's it is that in the aftermath of an attack like [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2320.54s)]
*  That they they reduce the threshold right over the aperture [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2327.1s)]
*  Maybe they shouldn't be doing that, you know, like I get the impulse to do it [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2330.62s)]
*  You want to find who did this but like this will only make that harder in the future [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2333.64s)]
*  Absolutely [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2337.82s)]
*  I saw a story in the intercept reported that some of the survivors of that strike in Afghanistan the tragic mistake two years ago are now [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2338.3s)]
*  In the US I think in California, but they still haven't gotten any financial compensation from the US government [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2344.44s)]
*  Which seems like in conceit that seems inconceivable. Yeah fix that if you're listening [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2349.44s)]
*  So speaking of the Pentagon Ben [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2353.4s)]
*  So on Monday an AI generated image of the Pentagon pouring out smoke on fire after some like explosion [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2355.8s)]
*  Went viral on Twitter panicked people led to a dip in the stock market turns out it was just fake [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2362.56s)]
*  It was AI generated. So a lot of the idiots spreading this hoax had blue check marks, of course [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2368.82s)]
*  They pay Elon for that privilege to disseminate fake news [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2375.2000000000003s)]
*  RT the Russian propaganda network pushed it around to I think it was on some state TV in Russia as well [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2378.52s)]
*  So, you know Ben, I think it was all fun and games when we were retweeting the Balenciaga Pope [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2383.56s)]
*  That was a great time [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2389.4s)]
*  But I worry like this is the future of AI on social media at least on Twitter since Elon doesn't seem to care [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2390.4s)]
*  But I just read today that the White House is now I think starting a process for how to I don't know regulate her reign in AI [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2396.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, which is a massive endeavor because it [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2403.04s)]
*  Everything from education to public health to financial markets to national security, right just to take this example [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2407.1200000000003s)]
*  This issue of images and deep fakes, you know, it's not hard [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2414.1600000000003s)]
*  This is like a relatively straightforward one like fake image of the Pentagon fire market dips [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2418.0800000000004s)]
*  Some blue check marks look like a bunch of rubes, but you know, but I was thinking in the context of like a Sudan Civil War [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2423.0s)]
*  right [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2429.4s)]
*  you could create like a fake AI generated version of the two warlords and like be giving like [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2431.16s)]
*  instructions to [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2438.08s)]
*  Tempere military forces, right? So this isn't just disinformation campaigns. You could like really destabilize countries fake atrocities [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2440.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah fake atrocities enrage, you know certain communities [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2446.64s)]
*  Fill a video of a fake burning Quran fake burning Quran. Imagine what that would have done back in the day or still today [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2451.64s)]
*  So to me like one place where this is clearly going in conversations is [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2458.88s)]
*  Is there there's gonna have to be some way of verifying? [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2463.2000000000003s)]
*  images, you know or [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2467.56s)]
*  You know whether they're images or videos [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2469.92s)]
*  Something that's like a signature like some yeah blue check. This is actually why the blue check mark thing [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2473.36s)]
*  I know like I'm just continuing to realize how much it sucks because if [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2478.28s)]
*  if you're only battle on behalf of like some [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2483.28s)]
*  Objective reality is is verification and then you basically turn verification into a joke [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2487.96s)]
*  That's a problem. It's a real bummer. Yeah some quicker headlines just a flag for everybody [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2493.76s)]
*  So the European Union find meta Facebook [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2497.84s)]
*  1.3 billion dollars for breaking EU privacy laws by transferring data from Europe to the US without proper safeguards [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2500.64s)]
*  This is the biggest financial penalty for a company in the five years since the EU enacted its general data protection regulation [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2506.7400000000002s)]
*  Which is designed to protect people's online data Facebook says they're gonna appeal it best of luck [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2513.28s)]
*  Also, Ben, I saw the first ever female Arab astronaut has arrived at the International Space Station. Her name is Riana Barnawy [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2519.0s)]
*  She's one of two Saudi astronauts on this mission [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2526.0400000000004s)]
*  She's gonna conduct stem cell and breast cancer research during her 10 days at the space station [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2528.28s)]
*  Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said that the entire nation is proud of Barnawy and that he can't wait to [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2532.76s)]
*  Unjustly imprison her upon her return I made up that last part, but you know, it's cool that she's up there [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2538.44s)]
*  It's cool that she's up there [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2543.62s)]
*  Who is the the worst Boston sports free agent signing that you can think of? [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2545.56s)]
*  Trade or something. I don't know that'll take me. Well, we did trade Babe Ruth. You did trade Babe Ruth [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2552.16s)]
*  I mean the point I'm making here is it it's kind of funny me that meta is named meta [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2557.12s)]
*  Because basically that's like they bet this whole company on the metaverse which is now failed and it's funny that they're saddled by the name [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2561.28s)]
*  It'd be like, you know the Mets most infamously signed Bobby Bonilla to this contract. You're still paying them [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2568.6s)]
*  We're still paying him. It'd be like if we change our name from the Mets to the New York Bobby Bonilla's [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2574.56s)]
*  Like so first of all, that's funny the 1.3 billion dollar fine [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2579.28s)]
*  To try to get them to not [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2583.36s)]
*  Move any European data to the US. That's what it was about saying that like European data privacy [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2585.84s)]
*  mandates that the data stay in Europe because it's not safe in the US and [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2592.52s)]
*  Like that's a pretty big marker to lay down from the European [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2597.48s)]
*  So this will go through appeals but like it does show that on these tech questions from social media to data [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2600.92s)]
*  And you know, we AI's looming their eyes and that like the Europeans appetite to regulate is going up [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2607.04s)]
*  Yeah, and it could hopefully will help us raise our levels to the newly reelected Greek prime minister says his government is going to investigate [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2612.96s)]
*  a video that shows about a dozen asylum seekers from Somalia Eritrea in Ethiopia [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2620.12s)]
*  Including several children in a six-month-old baby being taken in a van to a dock on the southern tip of the island of Lesbos [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2625.56s)]
*  Transferred to a speedboat motor outed to the sea transferred again to a Greek Coast Guard vessel [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2633.7599999999998s)]
*  Driven out of Greece's territorial waters and then abandoned in a black inflatable raft in the middle of the ocean six month old baby [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2639.3599999999997s)]
*  Luckily, these people were rescued by the Turkish Coast Guard [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2646.8799999999997s)]
*  Then obviously like our immigration policy record is got some real [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2650.7599999999998s)]
*  Horrible stains on it. But the video of these fucking monsters [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2655.24s)]
*  Passing a baby from one boat to another is like it's just sort of yeah, it's burned into my memory now [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2659.56s)]
*  Yeah, that New York Times deserves credit for the investigation [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2665.64s)]
*  I mean there have been rumors of this kind of thing happening and one of the things that's really tragic when you see something [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2669.08s)]
*  Like this is you realize shit. We're seeing this one. How many times does this happen? [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2673.9599999999996s)]
*  How many boats did not survive, you know [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2678.56s)]
*  There's an activist with like a long lens and a video camera exactly [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2682.8s)]
*  that's the only reason they got this one and and you know, the Greek government has taken like a hard line like this is I [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2686.2s)]
*  Mean this may not be their overt policy [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2692.32s)]
*  But this is definitely the orientation that they've moved to with by the way the support of the European Union [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2694.6s)]
*  So so this is you know, this is where immigration policy is gone in Europe [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2699.58s)]
*  We see where the immigration policy is in the US with Biden, you know maintaining a lot of the the strict [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2704.2799999999997s)]
*  Trump error rules. I mean [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2709.8799999999997s)]
*  Like there needs to be a shift back to [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2713.3599999999997s)]
*  Figuring out how to have a more humane approach [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2717.04s)]
*  like I get that open door policies are not you know gonna take in in the West, but [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2719.56s)]
*  We seem to have lost the thread on the humanity of this [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2726.12s)]
*  Even at the height of the refugee crisis in 2015 16 [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2729.6800000000003s)]
*  There was more of an effort to try to treat people humanely that that may have generated some backlash [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2733.0400000000004s)]
*  But I mean, I think we need to realize there's got to be a way to [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2738.48s)]
*  Enforce policies without doing crap like this. Yeah speaking of losing the thread on humanity [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2742.2000000000003s)]
*  Soccer star Vinicius jr. Is calling out racist soccer fans in Spain in the country itself for doing nothing to stop them [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2748.0800000000004s)]
*  So Vinicius jr. Plays for Real Madrid [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2755.0400000000004s)]
*  It's one of the best teams in Spain's La Liga one of the best teams in the world [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2758.16s)]
*  He posted a compilation video of fans in stadiums across Spain calling him a monkey and other vile things [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2761.36s)]
*  over and over and over again [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2769.4s)]
*  Real Madrid said that this abuse qualifies as hate crime the idiot chief executive of La Liga logged onto Twitter [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2771.76s)]
*  to [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2780.2400000000002s)]
*  Defend Spanish fans. He started arguing with me Cs jr. Going back and forth outrageous [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2781.28s)]
*  Lula da Silva the president of Brazil got asked about the matter at the g7. So there's like a global affair now [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2787.6000000000004s)]
*  So Spain wants to jointly host the 2030 World Cup with Portugal and Morocco [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2793.48s)]
*  Hopefully that can be some kind of pressure point to get them to take some real action and fix this problem and like I don't know [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2798.48s)]
*  Permanently ban these fans that pull this shit because it's all in video. You can see who's doing it [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2804.6400000000003s)]
*  It's not deniable, but it's truly it's like really appalling stuff [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2809.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and and it's just like you've seen this over the years just like a bunch of racist garbage like from from soccer fans [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2812.72s)]
*  And parts of Europe at a pretty big scale too. Like this isn't just usually with someone drunk guy [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2820.4399999999996s)]
*  These are like the whole sections whole stadiums chanting complete bullshit [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2825.58s)]
*  and by the way, like it's worth calling out these racist European fans like [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2830.0s)]
*  You know your players like you're more than happy to pay all this money to [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2836.16s)]
*  Bring players from [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=2842.02s)]

*  The kind of closing space around civil society [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3458.4s)]
*  Generally in your work and you're right. It's gotten a lot harder a lot more challenging [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3461.8s)]
*  But of course when you win victories therefore a lot more rewarding [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3466.0400000000004s)]
*  You know go back to the 90s 1990s and there was a sort of a sense of inevitability about you know [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3470.32s)]
*  This rollout of democracy reaching pretty much every corner of the world [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3477.92s)]
*  We reached a point where more than two-thirds of countries were fully fledged [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3482.4s)]
*  democracies, and it wasn't clear that trend was going to stop and [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3487.6000000000004s)]
*  You know at that time we were able to [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3492.88s)]
*  Operate under a fairly simple sort of narrative [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3495.96s)]
*  Formula in a way or theory of change formula may be better to put it where you know [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3500.24s)]
*  Democracy was rolling out people were adopting [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3506.24s)]
*  Constitutions they were holding elections and yet the problem was there wasn't a strong [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3509.08s)]
*  Civil society to contest these governments some of which still had a lot of people in them from previous more authoritarian [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3514.7999999999997s)]
*  governments so [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3522.2s)]
*  Building up the civil society as the the other side if you like of the scales to to [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3523.48s)]
*  democratic institutions and constitutionalism [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3531.56s)]
*  seen the way to make those democracies really breathe and live and and and [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3534.88s)]
*  Introduce challenge to ruling elites [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3540.76s)]
*  You know fast forward to now and we've gone through 17 years of democracy deficit [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3543.6s)]
*  Where every year Freedom House has reported a decline in the amount of democracy in the world and [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3549.32s)]
*  You know [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3557.8s)]
*  Organizations like ours are in many parts of the world on the back foot and in fact banned [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3559.44s)]
*  Essentially from from many countries, so it is a much more challenging environment [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3565.16s)]
*  But not least because that theory of change doesn't work anymore [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3570.7799999999997s)]
*  You know you've got to really understand the anatomy of power in these countries much more clearly to work out [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3574.6400000000003s)]
*  Where the levers of change still are you know? [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3582.44s)]
*  What will improve the quality of governance which will what will offer more protection to human rights? [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3586.6000000000004s)]
*  So I think we're down to a you know almost much more micro country by country [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3592.48s)]
*  Effort to define strategies to protect and rebuild democracy and human rights [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3597.36s)]
*  So and I want to get to kind of solutions and what's working but kind of one more question about the challenge [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3604.1600000000003s)]
*  OSF operates globally right so a lot of people think in terms of the extraordinary [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3612.0400000000004s)]
*  Work that's been done in Central Eastern Europe, but but obviously you guys are also in Africa. You're in Latin America [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3617.52s)]
*  You're in Asia and I'm curious how common are the challenges you face because there have been these kind of copycat laws [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3623.16s)]
*  and approaches around [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3630.44s)]
*  You know stamping out civil society or choking off any resourcing for civil society [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3632.6s)]
*  do you see that the democratic deficit the challenge as [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3636.88s)]
*  Distinct in different regions or do you feel like there's a common playbook that you're confronting in in all parts of the world? [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3641.6s)]
*  Well, I think there is a common playbook but it passes through the filter of local conditions [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3648.68s)]
*  So, you know, there are significant differences across countries and regions [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3654.02s)]
*  But you know the common playbook is you know democracy is not delivering results for citizens [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3659.2000000000003s)]
*  You know in despair reach out for a more populist solution, you know easy answers are promised [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3664.84s)]
*  They're rarely delivered and you know in that probably lies the seeds of the future defeat of authoritarianism [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3671.56s)]
*  I mean because you know populist government is much less able than democratic government to ultimately deliver [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3678.44s)]
*  The economic security the welfare the opportunity that people want [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3686.48s)]
*  So, you know, I don't think we we should despair about democracy [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3691.36s)]
*  This is a setback, but it needn't be a fatal one and you know in every country [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3695.6s)]
*  we see different coalitions of of either political parties, but increasingly [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3700.64s)]
*  Young activist social activist movements [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3706.94s)]
*  single-issue groups [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3710.7400000000002s)]
*  Think tanks of different kinds all combining [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3713.1800000000003s)]
*  Start to offer alternatives to either a failing populism or in other places a democracy [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3717.14s)]
*  Which isn't delivering for people. Yeah. Well that turns us into kind of solutions and [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3724.94s)]
*  I [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3730.9s)]
*  Want to talk first about kind of the role of governments and then getting into what OSF is doing [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3732.18s)]
*  I mean if you look at the g7 that just took place [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3736.46s)]
*  On the one end you've seen the United States far more so than in recent years [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3740.02s)]
*  Kind of embrace the language of democracy promotion and hold democracy summits and kind of frame [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3744.8599999999997s)]
*  Conflicts like the war in Ukraine or the competition with China around democratic values [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3751.66s)]
*  On the other hand, you know at the g7 you had [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3757.8999999999996s)]
*  Narendra Modi from India kind of getting the red carpet welcome [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3762.18s)]
*  Obviously, he's on the right side from the g7 perspective of geopolitical competition with China [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3766.3399999999997s)]
*  But we've talked a lot about democratic backsliding and populism in India on this podcast [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3770.74s)]
*  How do you see the [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3777.3399999999997s)]
*  the opportunity [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3780.16s)]
*  In the g7 in the United States come embracing the language of democracy [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3781.8599999999997s)]
*  But how does that how do you deal with the challenge of at the same time? They're doing that, you know [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3786.74s)]
*  They're embracing a Modi. They're courting a mom bin Salman [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3791.68s)]
*  What what good can you take from what's happening around the g7 and what challenges you see from the kind of narrow? [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3795.6s)]
*  geopolitical interests that sometimes complicate [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3803.9199999999996s)]
*  The the rhetoric of democracy promotion. Well, you know on the one hand, I think you know [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3806.6s)]
*  Biden genuinely has at least temporarily [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3810.8799999999997s)]
*  Save democracy in the US and should be celebrated as such [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3814.2s)]
*  That said I think there is you know a naivety that comes maybe from the euphoric [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3818.56s)]
*  Blood to the head moment of a campaign promise rather than a considered policy promising government that led to these [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3825.72s)]
*  democracy summits because you know in truth, you know [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3833.04s)]
*  Biden is spent more years in Washington than pretty much any poll [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3838.04s)]
*  Well than any other politician to occupy the presidency of all people [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3842.48s)]
*  Might have remembered that [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3847.6000000000004s)]
*  interests ultimately Trump values [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3850.0800000000004s)]
*  When it comes to foreign policy, I don't say that with any enthusiasm [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3853.1600000000003s)]
*  I say it with regret but it's you know a fact of life [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3858.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and so, you know, I think India is really the case in point because here is a country [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3861.6400000000003s)]
*  Which is treating its Muslim minority with in a very reckless way with disregard [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3868.96s)]
*  For their human rights on on in many cases [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3874.68s)]
*  and [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3879.08s)]
*  Yet is viewed by the US as a vital ally in the containment of China a member of the quad [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3880.4s)]
*  etc and [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3888.52s)]
*  You know, so it's getting a free pass on human rights. It's getting a free pass from the US on human rights and [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3890.76s)]
*  You know Saudi Arabia and even more embarrassing u-turn for a president who you know [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3897.3199999999997s)]
*  Not wanted to visit and who then the war in Ukraine forced him to turn to Saudi [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3904.16s)]
*  to sustain the US's allies energy security and [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3910.0s)]
*  so it's [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3915.3199999999997s)]
*  You know, he should have foreseen that I mean [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3917.64s)]
*  international politics delivers you surprises every day, but the [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3921.44s)]
*  Only surprise that you shouldn't have is that in [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3925.4199999999996s)]
*  Responding to the crises and the strategic threats you face [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3929.54s)]
*  You're gonna fall back on interests over values and you know in that sense, you know, I think he [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3933.3799999999997s)]
*  Probably, you know, he just hadn't given these democracy summits enough thought in advance. Yeah. Well, I [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3941.2599999999998s)]
*  Think what they would say to coming at something like the g7 is that Ukraine is so fundamental to the survivability or [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3948.9s)]
*  momentum around democracy that [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3956.02s)]
*  Sometimes you have to make those those trade-offs. I mean how in your work at OSF? [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3958.66s)]
*  I mean how central do you do you accept the premise that Ukraine? [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3963.7400000000002s)]
*  Is kind of the main event in some ways in terms of the fault line between you know a totalitarian or at least? [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3967.58s)]
*  autocratic Russia and the Democratic [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3975.1s)]
*  aspiring Democrat Democratic Ukraine [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3978.14s)]
*  Do you do do you believe that that the the outcome of that conflict? [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3981.42s)]
*  Based on the your networks around the globe that the outcome that conflict will [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3987.26s)]
*  ripple beyond just [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3992.62s)]
*  The space of Ukraine itself. Yeah, I do and you know, but I think that makes OSF a little unusual [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=3994.86s)]
*  I mean we've had a [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4000.86s)]
*  Office and a program and a foundation in Ukraine [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4004.3s)]
*  for more than 25 years and [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4007.82s)]
*  We spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars there on democracy human rights economic reform [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4011.5s)]
*  You know over many years with considerable frustration because you know corruption continued [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4017.62s)]
*  There was some very weak governments in quick succession [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4023.5s)]
*  It the biggest shot in the arm for Ukraine democracy and nation-building has been Putin's invasion [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4028.5s)]
*  You know tragic though it's been in terms of the loss of life and [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4035.06s)]
*  You know, so we are really committed to Ukraine and see this [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4040.74s)]
*  As much more than just a war in Europe that shouldn't preoccupied the wider world [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4045.7s)]
*  When a permanent member of the Security Council invades a neighbor without cause, you know, it is a breach of the most [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4051.34s)]
*  fundamental cardinal rule of [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4059.94s)]
*  The UN based international system, so it's a big deal [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4062.42s)]
*  You know that said, you know, I have in recent weeks months, you know been in Africa a couple of times [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4066.9s)]
*  being in countries like Lebanon being in Latin America and seeing that there is a [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4074.86s)]
*  really racing [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4080.98s)]
*  Bushfire of a crisis across many economies where you know debt is rapidly becoming unsustainable [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4083.86s)]
*  There is inflation in food and energy prices [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4091.02s)]
*  There is major disruption of supply chains all of it aggravated by the Ukraine conflict [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4093.98s)]
*  Which disrupted not just energy supplies, but wheat supplies grain supplies as well [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4100.62s)]
*  and [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4107.16s)]
*  You know, there just simply isn't enough attention from [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4108.46s)]
*  G7 leaders to this second crisis often called the poly crisis and you know that [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4113.7s)]
*  has led to a huge anger about double standards that comes on the heels of [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4120.62s)]
*  the anger felt around COVID access issues of [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4125.82s)]
*  Africa not getting covered drugs until two years after the world vaccinations until two years after the rest of the world kind of [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4129.94s)]
*  thing and you know, so there is a real anger which has been compounded by this [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4136.82s)]
*  but by this crisis and you know, obviously while I would argue that [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4142.82s)]
*  Ukraine is very different to those situations where America has gone in to other countries without the full blessing of the UN Security Council [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4148.9800000000005s)]
*  nevertheless [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4158.54s)]
*  for many there is over Kosovo and Iraq as well as more generally on Middle East policy by the US a [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4159.9800000000005s)]
*  Big whiff of double standards and so, you know in that context [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4168.18s)]
*  It's created a huge anger and [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4174.580000000001s)]
*  You know the G7 communique last weekend which had lots of new commitments and exciting stuff about f-16s [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4179.580000000001s)]
*  For Ukraine and had the visit of Zelensky himself to the summit [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4186.9400000000005s)]
*  You know was the normal sort of mix of nice words and good intentions, but not [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4192.3s)]
*  hard answers when it came to this other crisis [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4199.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and do you do you think put the debt piece of that at the top? [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4204.02s)]
*  I mean what you know, so I think people aren't aware of just how much you know, a huge swath of [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4207.780000000001s)]
*  Developing countries are on the precipice of default. It's not just the United States with itself imposed one [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4213.900000000001s)]
*  Do you think the G7 can be doing more around debt forgiveness or restructuring? [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4219.14s)]
*  Yeah, the very minimum you would have expected the G7 to have blessed some debt [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4222.780000000001s)]
*  Standstills for countries most in need which isn't even debt reductions or write-offs. It's just standstill on interest which then [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4227.82s)]
*  accumulates so [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4235.66s)]
*  You know, there were some very modest measures which would have produced some relief and headroom for countries in [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4237.82s)]
*  terrible difficulty at the moment and it's a [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4244.94s)]
*  Combination of both low-income countries and middle-income ones case of middle-income ones [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4248.219999999999s)]
*  They've you know over borrowed in euro bonds. Sometimes they've over borrowed from the Chinese as well and [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4253.7s)]
*  And and for the poor ones it's a lot of its official debt. It's not not private sector debt [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4261.46s)]
*  But in each case, you know rising interest rates depreciating local currencies [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4267.26s)]
*  falling state revenues because of [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4272.8s)]
*  Disruptions of exports, you know, all of these things are combining to make the debt service [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4275.38s)]
*  really difficult and reach [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4280.94s)]
*  critical crisis levels and [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4283.179999999999s)]
*  You know, it's very striking to me [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4285.66s)]
*  I was recently at the spring meetings of the World Bank and IMF in Washington where there was a sort of technical [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4287.339999999999s)]
*  conversation in technical language about how to [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4293.54s)]
*  Nudge up the so-called capital adequacy of the World Bank to essentially let allow it to lend a little bit more [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4296.94s)]
*  And then went from there to Nairobi, Kenya [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4304.099999999999s)]
*  where the sense of just sheer [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4307.78s)]
*  Crisis and alarm and a sort of debt doomsday [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4310.82s)]
*  Scenario was was huge civil servants haven't been paid that month, you know and [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4315.259999999999s)]
*  Across the continent. There was a real sense that these number debt crises [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4321.62s)]
*  Which at the moment the most front ones are Zambia and Ghana and Ghana a little bit of good news [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4326.32s)]
*  There was a deal last week a restructuring of the debt deal. But you know [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4331.24s)]
*  Zambia is still struggling to complete [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4337.52s)]
*  And you know people can't help but point out a Californian bank gets into trouble. It gets rescued in three days [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4340.200000000001s)]
*  Zambia has been [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4347.0s)]
*  several years [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4348.52s)]
*  waiting for its debt deal and still hasn't got it and so [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4350.360000000001s)]
*  This sense of how the West whether it's from kovat or to a bank failure [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4354.92s)]
*  Can deploy whatever it takes to stabilize the situation when its own? [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4361.04s)]
*  citizens are at risk is [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4366.240000000001s)]
*  reticent to the point of inaction [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4368.92s)]
*  when it comes to doing more than just [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4371.4400000000005s)]
*  Words and sympathy for the needs of developing countries [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4374.56s)]
*  So it's a pretty bad time out there in terms of North-South relations. Yeah. No, I think this is a really good point [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4378.26s)]
*  I think it's the most under discussed crisis in the world right now and it's [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4384.68s)]
*  Somewhat of our own making and that you know, you had a lot of cheap credit when interest rates were flat [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4389.400000000001s)]
*  Our our raising of interest rates in the United States is compounding this debt crisis on top of kovat and in the war in Ukraine [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4396.0s)]
*  I do want to ask you about [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4402.320000000001s)]
*  You know kind of a good news story. You were just in Brazil [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4404.76s)]
*  Where we've actually seen this kind of interesting [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4408.64s)]
*  Coalition between the kind of established progressive alternative to populism and Lula but a kind of younger [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4411.64s)]
*  And a network of folks who came together [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4418.280000000001s)]
*  To really try to save democracy in Brazil. I mean, what did you find there? What worked in Brazil? [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4421.92s)]
*  Not saying they're out of the woods completely but what worked there that people could learn from [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4427.52s)]
*  What what did you leave in terms of your impression of where Brazil is gone? Well, look [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4432.120000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think the first thing is to just reaffirm they're not out of the woods. This is a kind of quite weak [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4437.04s)]
*  Government, you know, it only won the popular vote by about one and a half percent the presidency [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4443.04s)]
*  And it does not enjoy a majority in Congress. So it's quite limited in its legislative capabilities [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4450.36s)]
*  And that's critical because it is a system quite like the US is and and so it's high and hands are partially [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4459.08s)]
*  tied but you know having and and and you know, the right could come back at [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4466.44s)]
*  The next election anytime really and it's had its own January the 6th on January the 8th [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4472.24s)]
*  When similarly its its its its presidential palace its court its legislature were invaded [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4478.96s)]
*  by pro Bolsonaro demonstrators [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4486.2s)]
*  So there's a fragility about it, but behind that fragility is this dynamic sort of anthill of activists [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4489.2s)]
*  Who built something remarkable and they come not I always use the analogy of [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4497.72s)]
*  British Labour Party where you know, we had governments where the leading figures in them were [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4504.64s)]
*  MPs from old labor union and mining districts in many cases and the you know, the advisors who weren't [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4511.240000000001s)]
*  ministers [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4519.96s)]
*  Themselves came from similar party backgrounds and then under Blair we got what we called New Labour [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4522.0s)]
*  which had a network of people drawn in from think tanks from [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4528.4800000000005s)]
*  ton of them had done being graduate students at the Kennedy School in the US [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4533.56s)]
*  and [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4538.76s)]
*  You know, there were a lot of activists coming in from single-issue [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4540.68s)]
*  Causes and you know, nothing reminded me more of the dawn of New Labour in the UK [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4545.44s)]
*  It seems a long time ago [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4551.38s)]
*  Then sort of new Workers Party if you like where you know [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4553.62s)]
*  extraordinary individuals a woman who'd gone straight from a favela to ten years of [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4558.58s)]
*  Playing sports for American universities and now is back as [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4566.9400000000005s)]
*  Returned as a social activist to inherit her sister who was assassinated [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4575.02s)]
*  And sort of mantle as a leader of [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4579.860000000001s)]
*  Black Afro-Brazilians and you know is now Minister for Racial Affairs [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4584.18s)]
*  an extraordinary [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4589.7s)]
*  Indigenous woman who you know has fought hard to protect the Amazon and the rights of indigenous peoples to their lands in the Amazon [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4593.18s)]
*  now [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4601.66s)]
*  Minister of a new ministry [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4602.62s)]
*  For indigenous peoples affairs and both of them were sworn in the same day and the presidential palace [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4605.14s)]
*  two days after it had been all its windows blown out by the riots and assault on it of January the 8th this year and [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4612.18s)]
*  You know a sense of renewal amidst that devastation these two remarkable women [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4620.3s)]
*  Probably 18 inches apart in height the very short indigenous [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4626.3s)]
*  woman this tall [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4630.82s)]
*  striking [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4632.9s)]
*  ex-volleyball player [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4634.46s)]
*  In it who was Minister for Racial Affairs [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4637.38s)]
*  so, you know a real sense of this and and the pride for us in OSF because [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4641.1s)]
*  this sort of [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4648.02s)]
*  revolving door of people going out of think tanks and social movements and into government and trying to drive through reform then going back to [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4649.26s)]
*  the think tank social movement world [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4657.74s)]
*  That to me is the modern anatomy of power in many places where [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4660.9s)]
*  you know, it's ideas which are going to change things and those ideas don't come from permanent living in government or from the [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4665.54s)]
*  increasingly sort of closed world of aging political parties, but they come from [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4674.099999999999s)]
*  Think tanks and social movements and in Brazil that virtuous revolving door seems to have been quite effectively [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4680.58s)]
*  Created well, so last question I want to ask you, you know globally we've seen a lot of coordination among far-right movements [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4689.1s)]
*  among autocrats [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4697.06s)]
*  What what needs to happen for that [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4700.5s)]
*  Ecosystem that you're describing to globalize for progressives or small D Democrats who are living in different parts of the world [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4703.34s)]
*  But facing similar challenges to kind of work together and obviously OSF is as network as anybody [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4710.860000000001s)]
*  And I did want to ask as you are [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4716.32s)]
*  Working to create that outcome, which I think you know this podcast and our listeners are very supportive of [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4719.04s)]
*  You're constantly dealing with the conspiracy theories about you George Soros. And does that matter? [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4725.08s)]
*  Is that I mean I see that as a as people trying to disrupt any effort to create coordination by making it seem like some big [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4730.32s)]
*  Conspiracy theory when in fact, we're all very transparent about wanting to support human rights [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4737.0s)]
*  I mean, how do you achieve that scale while kind of beating back these efforts to delegitimize your work? [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4741.28s)]
*  Well, let me take that second part first and and you know, I think it is [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4746.84s)]
*  You know, it's not [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4752.2s)]
*  One can't pretend it isn't without its damage to certain [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4753.8s)]
*  Susceptible audiences this idea that we're somehow the dark face of some, you know hidden [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4757.84s)]
*  Conspiracy and [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4765.68s)]
*  You know George gets the brunt of it, but I have an honored part as [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4767.92s)]
*  Henchmen in the UK who's busy apparently trying to recolonize America for the British crown [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4772.96s)]
*  and [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4779.52s)]
*  so it's it's it's it's it's their views seems to be that it's a strange mixture of [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4781.04s)]
*  Secret Jewish activists and British royalists who are conspiring against the right in America [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4787.4400000000005s)]
*  I sort of think there's an element of pride in being you know in who your enemies are about some of this [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4794.0s)]
*  But I think yeah, you know, it does do damage and we just last week, you know had [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4799.8s)]
*  You know a really [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4804.52s)]
*  vicious [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4806.56s)]
*  Twitter attack on on George which may have had up to a billion views through [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4808.04s)]
*  Yeah network of retweeting is happening to it. So one shouldn't you know underestimate this but you know for me [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4813.86s)]
*  You know our legitimacy lies in two things the partners we have and their credibility and authority [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4820.94s)]
*  in the communities and countries where they operate and our ability to [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4828.26s)]
*  support the development of new solutions either immediate urgent solutions to something like the debt crisis we were talking about or [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4833.82s)]
*  longer term patient solutions to global problems and here I would say this Ben that you know, I've really [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4841.78s)]
*  Having been involved in democracy and government all my life. I have come to conclude this isn't actually a crisis of democracy [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4848.860000000001s)]
*  it's a crisis of governing and [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4856.1s)]
*  You know that in all our countries developed or developing a light US UK [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4858.42s)]
*  Kenya Brazil you name it [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4864.860000000001s)]
*  There is this similar similar shared sense that government simply isn't delivering [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4867.18s)]
*  That minorities feel excluded, I mean minorities by economic status or ethnicity or [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4873.9400000000005s)]
*  class feel [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4881.06s)]
*  religion feel [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4883.38s)]
*  excluded [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4885.06s)]
*  but also that mainstream groups who've been used to an economic security for themselves and their families [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4886.7s)]
*  increasingly feel [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4894.3s)]
*  marginalized and you know, well and we're leaving a period of you know, I know it's a phrase which is getting too much [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4895.900000000001s)]
*  use nowadays but of a [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4902.679999999999s)]
*  Neoliberal paradigm where yeah small governments and leave it to big markets to sort out the allocation of wealth [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4905.24s)]
*  It has failed [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4913.04s)]
*  You know and it had [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4915.44s)]
*  It came to being on the shoulders of a new deal which had also failed for completely other reasons [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4917.32s)]
*  So we're a world casting around for a new political paradigm [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4923.0599999999995s)]
*  If you like after how to govern ourselves and I think we don't want to make the mistakes of going back to the very big [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4927.72s)]
*  big big government of the new deal [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4934.68s)]
*  We know there is a room for markets and the private sector [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4937.76s)]
*  Which was was the oxygen was squeezed out of in that period [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4942.6s)]
*  But nor do we want to continue the sin of neoliberalism which is allowing the markets [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4946.04s)]
*  To sort out our our economic and social security and well-being and so we're casting around [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4952.639999999999s)]
*  How do we build the kind of government which can address our internal? [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4960.36s)]
*  divisions and exclusions and build a much kinder more inclusive kind of governance and [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4964.72s)]
*  globally a kind of government which both at the national and more global level can address these big [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4971.72s)]
*  Strategic long-term problems that need sustained public investment over decades [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4978.12s)]
*  such as the transition to green energy and the efforts to limit global warming and [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4983.6s)]
*  You know and so I think you know populism and failed democracy are two sides of the same coin of a governing [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4989.92s)]
*  Idea that isn't delivering and so I think we're all on this shared journey and you know my vision for OSF is that [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=4997.56s)]
*  Over the next 10 years we can see the social movements and the think tanks at the national level [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=5005.64s)]
*  Which will together collectively? [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=5012.4s)]
*  Arrive at some kind of global [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=5016.12s)]
*  Consensus on the best way we should all govern ourselves and I don't for a moment mean it's gonna be world government [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=5018.36s)]
*  It'll be strong national government [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=5024.32s)]
*  But national governments which share a lot more of a view about how to best tackle these common problems [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=5025.84s)]
*  We all have and I you know in the past whether it was the Thatcher Reagan years or the New Deal and [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=5033.92s)]
*  welfare state years of [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=5041.92s)]
*  generation earlier [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=5044.72s)]
*  You know it was a narrow range of think tanks and and intellectuals and academics [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=5046.320000000001s)]
*  very heavily in those days concentrated in Washington and London who and and [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=5052.04s)]
*  Cambridge mass and few other places who developed this or Chicago when it came to the Reagan [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=5057.28s)]
*  Thatcher [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=5064.6s)]
*  Period this time the ideas for the new order will not come from such a narrow range of places [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=5066.0s)]
*  You know we'll find them in India. We'll find them in China. We'll find them in Kenya or Brasilia and [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=5072.16s)]
*  You know that's what for me is the excitement of running OSF that we can [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=5077.52s)]
*  Help seed the thinking that will produce a new and better way for us to govern ourselves [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=5083.28s)]
*  well, look, that's a great note to end on mark and [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=5090.56s)]
*  You know one thing I've noticed in being in this space is [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=5093.56s)]
*  one thing that's true today versus five or ten years ago, so only ten years ago is just [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=5097.08s)]
*  the awareness of the challenges and and the desire for new solutions and and people feeling [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=5102.32s)]
*  The need for mobilization so OSF is obviously a huge part of that and we we appreciate you coming on to talk about it [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=5108.48s)]
*  Thank you, Ben. Thanks again to mark for joining the show [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=5114.639999999999s)]
*  You know, maybe we'll just go to this moon hotel. I think they're building something like that in Vegas [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=5118.0s)]
*  See, but Vegas would do it in a more tasteful way because it's pretty small, you know, like these replicas are you have New York? [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=5123.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, you know New York New York or the Eiffel Tower. There's like a [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=5129.599999999999s)]
*  Tower. Yeah, I don't know. I guess I'm defending Vegas here [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=5135.04s)]
*  But still just try better like be better more interesting if you had that but here's the thing like [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=5137.76s)]
*  That's you put your finger on it. Like these people have like a trillion dollars, right? [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=5145.16s)]
*  They're like liquid to the tune of a trillion dollars. They can write checks [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=5149.4400000000005s)]
*  Think what you would do with that money. Yeah, not build the moon. It's not this it looks like a Death Star [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=5152.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I would well, yeah, I mean kind of kind of is maybe it is maybe that's what this is really about excited for cop 28 [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=5157.12s)]
*  You have cop 28 in the moon in the moon. Yeah, excellent. Okay. Well, that's it for for us this week and talk to you guys next week [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYDKm_gk8Ek&t=5164.6s)]
