# Israel to Strike Back at Iran, But Says Nuclear and Oil Facilities Will Be Spared
**Pod Save the World:** [October 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI)
*  Welcome back to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Ben Rhodes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=0.0s)]
*  Ben, I think sometimes listeners tire of our sports banter at the top, but this time [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3.04s)]
*  we have a foreign policy connection. Your coach of the Jets, Robert Salah, was recently fired. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=8.16s)]
*  Yeah, I was hoping we could banter about the Mets. Never heard of them. But did you see how Salah [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=14.08s)]
*  was wearing a Lebanese flag? Yeah, the Lebanese flag during the game in London, and then the Jets [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=20.56s)]
*  lost and then he got canned by Woody Johnson, owner of the Jets and former Trump ambassador [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=27.6s)]
*  to the United Kingdom. And there was some suggestion that maybe there was a connection [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=34.96s)]
*  between the Lebanese flag and the firing and not the Jets sucking ass and the firing. And I saw a [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=38.88s)]
*  tweet that I thought you'd enjoy, which someone at River Tam YDN tweeted, the New York Jets would [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=46.16s)]
*  let a coach wear an ISIS flag if he could win the AFC East. Yeah, I mean, I think that [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=51.36s)]
*  Woody Johnson, it was probably all of the above. I'm sure that he's not a supporter of the Lebanese [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=57.84s)]
*  people in the same way that we would want him to be. I'm sure also that he didn't like his team [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=65.36s)]
*  losing in London where he was the ambassador, where he probably wanted to impress his friends. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=69.84s)]
*  And I don't know what role Aaron Rodgers played, but it couldn't have been good. I will say. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=74.8s)]
*  You want 30 seconds on the Mets? You want to sound off? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=80.72s)]
*  The Mets are giving me the most joy I've had in my life in a while. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=82.48s)]
*  You've been very happy on group text. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=85.92s)]
*  Yes, except for I decided to kind of break the bank, do the StubHub thing, go to game one, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=87.52s)]
*  take my nine-year-old daughter, super excited for her to share in this Mets run. I was about [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=94.08s)]
*  her age the last time the Mets won the World Series. And of course, I picked the one game [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=100.48s)]
*  that they lost nine to nothing. Oh, nine nothing? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=104.32s)]
*  And got three hits and never were in the game. So she had a baptism by fire of what it's like [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=107.52s)]
*  to be a Mets fan, even in a good playoff run. Was it fun? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=113.92s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, Dodger Stadium is loud. That's cool. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=117.2s)]
*  Trafficky getting in and out, but in there, good food, good snacks. I mean, if you're nine, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  that's the stuff that matters. Yeah, that's all that matters. You get [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=128.8s)]
*  an ice cream and a little baseball helmet. We didn't. Yeah, I kind of struck out as a [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=131.12s)]
*  dad this time around. I got kind of dad food. We got nachos instead of ice cream, but it was good. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=135.2s)]
*  I went to, I scalped the ticket to the 2018 Dodgers Red Sox World Series in LA. And it was [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=140.88s)]
*  great because I got a ticket I could not have afforded or found in Boston in like a hundred [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=147.11999999999998s)]
*  years. And we won. We watched them watch them clinch. Well, that's the truth, actually. The [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=151.44s)]
*  same tickets I bought in LA, New York would probably be four times as much. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=156.72s)]
*  Ten grand. Yeah. Well, I think they're going to do well. You're going to be okay. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=160.56s)]
*  Sorry to all the Phillies fans out there. Sorry, not sorry. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=165.36s)]
*  You're not sorry. Yeah. I kind of should be honest. I like really hate all Pennsylvania sports [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=168.8s)]
*  because I hate the Steelers and I hate the Phillies and I hate the Eagles. We're going [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=174.48s)]
*  on a long time about this. Well, yeah, I just had to explain because [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=178.24s)]
*  Ella's like, the Dodgers, a big rival. I'm like, well, you know, New York and LA have a thing, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=182.08s)]
*  but it's northeastern cities that that's the real rivalry, right? The Philadelphia. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=185.76s)]
*  And I like the city and I have friends there, but when it comes to sports, like you want to, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=191.6s)]
*  you know, I saw Governor Josh Shapiro when we were in Philly briefly and I told him that Philly was [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=196.16s)]
*  JV Boston and he did not find that funny. I almost punched me. Well, it kind of is JV [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=202.88s)]
*  Boston. That's what I'm saying, dude. That's what I'm saying. Anyway, enough about us. That's [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=208.56s)]
*  going to World Series. We're going to talk about the latest from Gaza in this episode and all the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=213.12s)]
*  concern that is in the press these days about a plan by a bunch of retired Israeli generals [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=217.28s)]
*  to lay siege on northern Gaza and starve out anyone left there. We're going to update you on [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=223.52s)]
*  the latest from Lebanon as well as reports about how Israel might retaliate to Iran's [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=228.24s)]
*  ballistic missile attack from two weeks ago, what Iran knew about the October 7 terrorist attack [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=232.48s)]
*  before it happened and what was described as Iran's Trump administration hit list by Politico. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=237.04s)]
*  Interesting story there. Very long story. Long hit list, apparently. Then we'll talk about why [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=243.44s)]
*  North Korean soldiers are reportedly in Russia, why Indian and Canadian diplomats are getting [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=247.76s)]
*  expelled from the respective countries, and then we'll celebrate a young German lawmaker [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=253.44s)]
*  who dunked on Hungarian dictator Viktor Orban to his face. Very fun. And then, Ben, you just did [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=258.24s)]
*  an interview. What did you talk about? Yeah, I talked to Saad Mossani, who you probably remember [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=263.92s)]
*  from the White House. He runs the Moby Group, which has Tolo News, the leading independent news [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=269.36s)]
*  source in Afghanistan for the last two decades, and he's got a book out called Radio Free Afghanistan [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=276.32s)]
*  that tells the story of this 20-year odyssey he's had. And it's fascinating. We cover what that was [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=281.76s)]
*  like to set up a media enterprise in Afghanistan that has news, but also soap operas and singing [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=288.08000000000004s)]
*  shows and the full works, what it was like to deal with the American forces there, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=292.56s)]
*  his assessment of Afghan leaders like Hamid Karzai, national Afghani, what it was like when things [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=298.72s)]
*  collapsed at the end, and he's both covering a story and he has employees leaving. But really, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=303.92s)]
*  interestingly, what it's like in Afghanistan today and the nuances of the Taliban, the complexities [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=308.24s)]
*  of the Taliban, they're still on air. So some things have changed. Guess what? There are no soap [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=316.32000000000005s)]
*  operas, no music, but they're still reporting the news. So if anybody's interested in not just [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=320.96000000000004s)]
*  Afghanistan's history, but where things are today, you should check it out. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=325.44s)]
*  Do you think there's an Afghanistan version of Politico that's writing stories about fights [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=328.4s)]
*  between the national security press secretary, the Taliban, and the domestic policy person in the US? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=332.16s)]
*  Yeah, getting sourced in the Taliban's- That wouldn't be fun. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=338.48s)]
*  Can't be that easy. That's not a fun drinks and lunch circuit. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=341.36s)]
*  No, there's no drinks to beat Sweden. That's not good. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=343.76s)]
*  No, no. I will definitely listen to that. That sounds fascinating. All right, Ben, let's start [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=347.52s)]
*  in Gaza, because in particular, the northern part of Gaza, where fighting is both intensified [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=351.92s)]
*  and the humanitarian situation is increasingly desperate. So the IDF surrounded the Jabalia [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=358.40000000000003s)]
*  refugee camp in an effort to take out the remaining Hamas fighters, they say, are in the area. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=364.0s)]
*  At the same time, the UN and countless other organizations are sounding the alarm [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=368.96000000000004s)]
*  about the humanitarian situation in northern Gaza after the Israelis [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=374.16s)]
*  closed off the main aid crossings into northern Gaza in early October. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=377.68s)]
*  But what makes this situation different from all the other previous times we've talked about [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=382.16s)]
*  Israel, like limiting or cutting off aid flows into Gaza, is that a group of retired generals [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=387.36s)]
*  recently proposed a plan where Israel would say to the Palestinians, you have one week to get out of [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=392.64000000000004s)]
*  northern Gaza, the northern Gaza Strip, before we seal it off. Anyone who stays will automatically [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=398.96000000000004s)]
*  be considered a combatant and military target. And the IDF will then lay siege to the entire area, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=404.8s)]
*  cutting off all food and water to either kill you or starve you out. Now, this is referred to as [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=410.08s)]
*  the general's plan. So this idea was pitched to Netanyahu, was pitched to the Israeli parliament. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=415.12s)]
*  The Associated Press reported that Netanyahu was considering it. There's about 400,000 people [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=419.76s)]
*  and left in northern Gaza. Most of them have been forcibly displaced multiple times. And they're [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=424.88s)]
*  now facing more orders to leave. According to Axios, Yoav Galant, the Israeli defense minister, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=430.56s)]
*  called Lloyd Austin over the weekend, our secretary of defense, and told him that Israel will not [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=435.52s)]
*  carry out the general's plan. But that kind of reassurance seems to be undercut by the fact that [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=441.04s)]
*  the aid has been basically cut off for two weeks. So it's hard to figure out what's happening here. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=445.04s)]
*  On Sunday, General Austin, our secretary Austin and Tony Blinken, the secretary of state, sent a [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=448.64s)]
*  letter to two top Israeli officials articulating a whole range of demands and ways that humanitarian [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=454.0s)]
*  situation is deteriorating in northern Gaza. They asked for Israel to immediately start letting [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=459.76s)]
*  350 A-trucks a day into Gaza to allow for pauses in fighting for humanitarian relief, including [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=465.28s)]
*  polio vaccinations, and then to take a bunch of steps to prepare for winter. It's a long, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=471.52s)]
*  extensive list. But the letter seems to suggest that the US would cut off weapons shipments to [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=475.44s)]
*  Israel if these things don't happen. More on that in a second. So Ben, just to clarify for listeners, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=481.52s)]
*  laying siege to all of Gaza like this would almost certainly be a massive war crime. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=486.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's a war crime. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=491.92s)]
*  Like, sieges aren't illegal per se, but you have to take all these specific steps to- [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=492.56s)]
*  You have to allow food in. You have to allow food in. You have to protect civilians in the way you [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=496.16s)]
*  conduct your military. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=499.6s)]
*  Especially with hospitals or special things you have to do with hospitals. I also suspect this [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=500.08000000000004s)]
*  would become item number one in the ICJ genocide trial if they were to actually implement this. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=504.24s)]
*  But Ben, what did you make of this letter from the Biden administration to the Israeli [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=509.84000000000003s)]
*  to the Israelis, declaring the latest ultimatum and hinting at a cutoff of weapons? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=515.44s)]
*  Well, given that, first of all, that letter should have been sent in November of last year. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=523.2800000000001s)]
*  We're 13 months into this, and now we're sending this letter. This is the approach. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=531.7600000000001s)]
*  It just shows, first of all, that their approach has failed. We're supposed to hug BB and get [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=538.1600000000001s)]
*  all these results. Well, if that was working, you wouldn't have to threaten this kind of action. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=544.08s)]
*  But to me, it says that what American officials are seeing is deeply worrying. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=549.9200000000001s)]
*  We should state that what we've just seen in the last few days, the grinding normalization. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=555.2s)]
*  You remember a year ago when Al-Shifa hospital was bombed. There was a huge debate about it. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=565.0400000000001s)]
*  Now- [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=569.12s)]
*  It's a global story. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=569.5200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. They've destroyed the entire healthcare infrastructure in Gaza, all of it. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=570.24s)]
*  They literally, children were incinerated in tents nearby a makeshift hospital. There's no [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=574.48s)]
*  pretense of restraint. What's really come back in full force are these aid restrictions. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=580.72s)]
*  I think what leads to that letter is a sense from American officials that these aid restrictions [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=587.2s)]
*  are once again a matter of policy. This isn't just kind of, oh, it's tough getting trucks in. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=592.72s)]
*  There seems to have been a cutoff- [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=598.5600000000001s)]
*  It's a choice, yeah. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=599.6800000000001s)]
*  ... getting it. It's a choice. I think that probably indicates the trigger that led to [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=600.0s)]
*  this letter being sent. Maybe our politics have something to do this too, because the other thing [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=605.2s)]
*  that's happened is there's no pretense of negotiating a ceasefire deal. Now, that's gone. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=609.36s)]
*  We're in a post-ceasefire negotiation world. That was the main event for many months. Now, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=614.56s)]
*  we're back to Israel pursuing military solutions in Gaza that, as we've talked about, are unachievable, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=620.56s)]
*  unless, and the general's plan kind of gives away the game, the plan is ultimately to make it [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=628.64s)]
*  unlivable and to displace the population and probably bring back Israeli settlements in [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=633.68s)]
*  northern Gaza. They'll claim it's for a buffer zone or something, but that's ethnic cleansing, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=640.24s)]
*  what that plan is. I think the letter represents a degree of frustration that the US approach has [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=647.68s)]
*  not worked. Ceasefire negotiations have not worked. Nothing we've said privately or publicly [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=654.8s)]
*  has brought about any restraint, and we're seeing very worrying limitations, if not [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=660.7199999999999s)]
*  wholesale prohibitions on aid getting in again. If the past is prologue, the Israelis will let [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=666.4s)]
*  a few trucks in, it'll get a little bit better, but it'll still be terrible, and maybe that [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=674.24s)]
*  is enough for this administration. I don't know. We'll see. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=679.1999999999999s)]
*  Some trucks will start going back in, and then some group of crazy settlers will block the next [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=681.84s)]
*  set, and the government will throw up its hands. You mentioned this horrific fire at a refugee camp [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=686.48s)]
*  next to a hospital. There were two specific videos from the Gaza Strip that I wanted to highlight, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=695.12s)]
*  because they've haunted me ever since I saw them, and also I think we sometimes talk about the [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=701.12s)]
*  politics and national security implications, and when you do that only, you can lose touch [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=706.08s)]
*  to the humanity. The first is this October 14th IDF airstrike on Al-Aqsa Hospital. The airstrike [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=710.8s)]
*  starts a fire, starts burning all these tents, housing displaced people, and it burnt a bunch [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=717.28s)]
*  of people alive, including kids, including a 19-year-old named Shaban Dalu. Shaban Dalu had [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=722.4s)]
*  been injured in a previous Israeli airstrike, and in this video, you can see him raise his arm [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=729.5999999999999s)]
*  while in a gurney attached to an IV as he burns alive on video. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=735.2800000000001s)]
*  These are not Hamas fighters. This is the dehumanization that is required to do that [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=741.44s)]
*  to human beings, and to be doing it 13 months after the fact. There are no words left. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=748.6400000000001s)]
*  For not to shock the conscience. There was a period of time where a video like that would [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=756.4000000000001s)]
*  become a global story, an all-consuming thing on all media in all countries, and maybe it is [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=760.8s)]
*  outside of the US, but for me, it was a thing in my Twitter algorithm because Twitter knows I care [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=765.28s)]
*  about this. That's what's so discordant about this war is that, yes, there's this kind of attrition [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=770.56s)]
*  where it grinds you down and it gets normalized, but outside the US, this stuff is far more [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=775.92s)]
*  consequential in terms of driving opinion. You've seen this. Emmanuel Macron is increasingly [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=783.52s)]
*  outspoken about Israel needing to stop this. The US is standing increasingly alone in this blank check [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=789.92s)]
*  for the Israeli military operation in Gaza, and that's going to have very long-term consequences [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=800.4799999999999s)]
*  for global views of the United States. Kamala Harris put out a statement on the [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=806.4799999999999s)]
*  Northern Gaza humanitarian situation, right? She did, and I didn't see one from Biden. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=810.7199999999999s)]
*  I don't know that. I might have missed it. It could have come from the briefing room or something, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=814.8s)]
*  but I did catch that. I thought it would be interesting. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=817.68s)]
*  Yeah. No, I mean, look, she's got ... I believe that in the next three weeks, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=819.52s)]
*  she's not going to solve Gaza even by taking positions that I agree with. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=827.1999999999999s)]
*  I think the important point is if she wins, hopefully, she's got some pretty big decisions [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=831.92s)]
*  to make out of the gate here because continuing this policy will immediately color global opinion [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=837.8399999999999s)]
*  of her. It's a tough inheritance, a really hard inheritance because I don't think she was [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=845.44s)]
*  responsible for Gaza policy. Joe Biden had a very clear sense of how he wanted to handle this. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=852.96s)]
*  But yeah, this is going to be there the day after the election, no matter who wins. But for her, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=861.2800000000001s)]
*  it's going to be a tough set of decisions in the transition. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=867.36s)]
*  Yeah. Then there was one other video that I saw. Again, it was shared on Twitter. I know even less [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=869.84s)]
*  about it, but I literally have not been able to stop thinking about it because there was a clip [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=874.4s)]
*  of this small boy who's maybe five consoling his younger brother who looks like he was two or three. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=878.3199999999999s)]
*  The younger boy is saying, I want my mom as the older one rubs his back. Their mother had been [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=883.6s)]
*  killed in an Israeli airstrike. I don't know how you can watch these videos and not imagine yourself [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=889.1999999999999s)]
*  or your kids in their place. You know what I mean? What makes me so ... I have a bunch of friends [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=895.92s)]
*  and acquaintances who I'm sure as you do too, or even elected officials who I just fight about on [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=902.0s)]
*  text chains constantly about the war in Gaza. What I find is I get to a point where a lot of [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=907.12s)]
*  the supporters of what's still happening in the Gaza offensive, they can't seem to recognize that, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=914.0s)]
*  yes, of course October 7th was an evil, unjustifiable act. But now October 7th is [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=920.88s)]
*  being used to justify inflicting nearly identical horrors and suffering on Palestinian civilians [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=929.44s)]
*  seemingly in perpetuity. You just get to this point of the debate where it's like a mental block, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=937.0400000000001s)]
*  and I find that people just seem to refuse to engage with that reality. You know what I mean? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=942.5600000000001s)]
*  Like on a human level, on a moral level, even on a strategic level, because I just ... It's wrong, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=948.5600000000001s)]
*  but it's also going to ensure that these people hate you. If someone did that to me, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=958.8s)]
*  someone killed my wife, someone killed my kid, I would fucking hate you, and I would want to kill [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=962.8s)]
*  you until the day I died. I worry that that's a natural feeling on either side, to have that [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=967.1999999999999s)]
*  hatred when someone harms you like this. But it's just every day growing in perpetuity. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=973.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Like you, I find it hardest obviously to consume any of these pictures, videos, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=978.88s)]
*  stories related to children, because like you, I immediately think about my children. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=985.84s)]
*  It's interesting the kind of reaction you get. Sometimes people will say, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=991.2800000000001s)]
*  well, it's all Hamas's fault. Part of it is Hamas's fault, but not all of it is. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=997.76s)]
*  It's not the case that these people are all Hamas. It's just not. They are not all Hamas. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1007.0400000000001s)]
*  These are not all inevitable consequences of war. These are not all because Hamas is using [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1012.08s)]
*  people as human shields. The scale of destruction, all of Gaza is destroyed. Almost everybody's lost [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1018.24s)]
*  a family member. Children are being killed in the tens of thousands. That's the kind of a policy [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1024.16s)]
*  choice too. It's not just like one stray bomb. Then you get the, well, you don't talk enough about [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1031.52s)]
*  you don't talk enough about October 7th or what Hamas wants to do. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1038.32s)]
*  It's like I do. We do. I have. It's been a year. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1043.6s)]
*  But it's been over a year. To your point, I don't know that this is guaranteeing long-term security [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1047.6799999999998s)]
*  for Israel. I get some people after my Tennessee Coats interview too saying things like, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1053.76s)]
*  they're just profoundly misinformed. Why don't you ask them how Arabs have more rights in Israel [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1058.3999999999999s)]
*  than in other Arab countries? It's not that they're under occupation. You may point to [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1065.76s)]
*  an Arab citizen of Israel proper, but these people seem to have no idea what it's like to be in Gaza [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1071.76s)]
*  or what it's like to be in the West Bank or what it's like to be in Southern Lebanon right now. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1077.04s)]
*  They don't want to engage that at all. This is the last point I want to make, which is that [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1080.64s)]
*  it's both obviously the suffering that we're seeing, but it's also what it does to the people [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1085.36s)]
*  that are doing this. It's not healthy. It has not been healthy for the United States [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1091.52s)]
*  to be in a 20-year war on terror. There is some causation to Trump there. There's something about [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1098.24s)]
*  the jingoism and the normalization of torture and the dehumanization of populations in other [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1105.68s)]
*  countries. What happened in the right-wing media? Somehow Trump is a product of our post-9-11 [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1112.32s)]
*  response. It's something I've always thought of. What is this doing to the nature of Israeli [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1119.36s)]
*  society to be doing this to human beings? That's a profound question that I think people need to [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1124.3999999999999s)]
*  stop and think about here because what is Israel on the back end of this? I think if you look at [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1134.8s)]
*  Ben Gavir and Smotrich, it gives you a bit of a sense of what that is, and it's not good. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1143.36s)]
*  There's a piece of this I think you and I, or most Americans, just fundamentally cannot understand, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1147.2s)]
*  which is the depth of the religious extremism on both sides, frankly, in Hamas, but also someone [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1151.76s)]
*  like Itamar Ben Gavir or Baruch Goldstein, people who mass murder their opponents for these [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1157.9199999999998s)]
*  religious fundamentalist reasons. Our experience after 9-11 just reminded you that to continue to [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1166.24s)]
*  take these offensive actions and to justify doing all these things, the level of fear that needs to [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1175.68s)]
*  be permeated through the culture of a society, by the government, among the people, everyone needs [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1182.0800000000002s)]
*  to feel like they're at risk at all times. Everything gets hyped to the 10th, 11th degree [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1191.2s)]
*  to justify what's happening. That's not healthy either. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1197.52s)]
*  Yeah. The last thing I'd say about this is you and I have experience with this. I don't think [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1201.52s)]
*  the excesses of the Obama years are anywhere near the early war on terror and torture and Guantanamo [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1207.28s)]
*  and the invasion of Iraq, but there were excesses in the Obama years. You can explain each individual [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1213.6s)]
*  thing. Here's why we had to take this strike or here's why this thing is justified. Can you justify [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1221.4399999999998s)]
*  the collective? Can you step back and look at Gaza and what it looks like today and say, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1228.64s)]
*  yeah, that was the right thing to do? Right. Look at how much money and time [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1235.2s)]
*  the US spent on the war on terror. Look at the number of places that we bombed or drones struck [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1239.8400000000001s)]
*  or whatever. Does everyone feel safer? Is there less al-Qaeda now than then? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1244.3200000000002s)]
*  There's more. Look at what those places have become. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1248.64s)]
*  Anyway, let's turn the weapon on. Yes. Yeah. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1252.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. The IDF ground invasion there is expanding. The New York Times looked at some satellite [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1254.48s)]
*  images and videos posted by the Israeli military and they found the IDF stem moving across the [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1260.32s)]
*  border into Lebanon, into a bunch of different places. Very inhospitable terrain, by the way, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1264.32s)]
*  large valleys and things. Yeah, mountains. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1268.96s)]
*  Yeah, that Hezbollah has prepared for a long time. This is really grueling fighting. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1270.72s)]
*  A lot of this fighting, I think all of it at the moment, is happening in what is supposed to be [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1275.68s)]
*  like a UN police buffer zone between the two countries established after the war in 2006. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1280.32s)]
*  However, Israel has told residents of dozens of towns just north of that border [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1285.84s)]
*  that they too have to evacuate. So it seems like the ground invasion is going to expand. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1292.08s)]
*  In addition to the ground invasion though, the IDF is launching heavy airstrikes in and around [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1298.48s)]
*  Beirut and in southern Lebanon. I was just listening to a BBC report where the reporter [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1302.8s)]
*  said that Israel conducted 200 airstrikes in the last 24 hours. So the volume is increasing and also [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1309.12s)]
*  the kind of geographic spread of where they're hitting targets is expanding. The IDF even bombed [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1315.84s)]
*  this small Christian majority village called Aitu in northern Lebanon and killed 21 people, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1320.8s)]
*  and I think that's getting investigated. So, Yuv Galant, the Israeli defense minister, says [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1326.56s)]
*  that these strikes have destroyed two-thirds of Hezbollah's estimated 150,000 rockets. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1331.6799999999998s)]
*  Lebanon's health ministry says more than 2,300 people have been killed and 10,000 injured [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1336.88s)]
*  since the fighting between Hezbollah and Israel started like, you know, what, a year ago, but about [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1341.92s)]
*  75% of those killed were in the last month. The UN has said that 400,000 children in Lebanon were [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1346.16s)]
*  displaced in the past three weeks, but the Israelis have taken some serious casualties too. A Hezbollah [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1353.0400000000002s)]
*  drone managed to get past Israeli defense systems and hit a military base which killed four IDF [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1358.24s)]
*  soldiers and wounded dozens of others, and Hezbollah's firing hundreds of rockets per day [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1363.36s)]
*  into northern Israel or at northern Israel. So there's still this ongoing fighting. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1368.4799999999998s)]
*  The IDF also has had these weird clashes with UN peacekeepers in the region. On Sunday, Israeli [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1372.8s)]
*  tanks entered a base housing UN peacekeepers stationed in southern Lebanon. No one was hurt, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1377.9199999999998s)]
*  but it was this weird kind of mini-occupation for a few hours. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1383.36s)]
*  Yeah, and now taped one of his videos threatening the UN mission. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1386.8s)]
*  Yeah, so like the UN officials are furious. Georgia Maloney was furious because the [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1390.88s)]
*  prime minister of Italy, because a lot of these peacekeepers are Italian, but Netanyahu blamed [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1395.0400000000002s)]
*  the UN and said, quote, the refusal to evacuate the peacekeepers, quote, makes them hostages of [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1399.1200000000001s)]
*  Hezbollah. This endangers both them and the lives of Israeli soldiers. So he just lashes out at [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1404.72s)]
*  everyone. So Ben, last thing on this, the Biden administration's policy is evolving on Lebanon. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1409.68s)]
*  So for a year, you know, Biden pressured Netanyahu not to launch a second front with Hezbollah. I [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1414.8000000000002s)]
*  think we gave him a lot of credit for succeeding there on the show. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1419.92s)]
*  It was their big success. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1422.64s)]
*  There was their big effort to broker a ceasefire back at the UN during UNGA. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1423.68s)]
*  But now that this IDF invasion of Lebanon is happening, the administration says Israel has, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1427.68s)]
*  quote, the right to conduct these limited incursions to degrade Hezbollah's capability. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1433.52s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1438.96s)]
*  What's your confidence that these are limited, by the way? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1439.68s)]
*  Well, it's absolutely extraordinary that you could spend months trying to avoid this outcome, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1441.6000000000001s)]
*  literally be negotiating a ceasefire at the time that the escalation takes place with the [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1447.9199999999998s)]
*  strike on Nasrallah. And then a week later, Israel does the thing that you've been telling [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1456.0s)]
*  them not to do for a full year. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1461.84s)]
*  You're like, atta boy. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1463.12s)]
*  And you're like, that's great. We support this. We should degrade their infrastructure, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1464.1599999999999s)]
*  which by the way, is such an amorphous statement as to mean anything. You know, that's a blank check [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1467.84s)]
*  if there ever was one. Go ahead and degrade their infrastructure. Where does that stop? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1473.44s)]
*  Infrastructure could mean Hezbollah walks up to some farmer and says, hey, man, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1479.1200000000001s)]
*  we're putting 10,000 rockets in your barn. You've got a problem with it? Let us know. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1482.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1486.48s)]
*  And so they end up there. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1486.72s)]
*  So then you bomb that. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1487.44s)]
*  Hezbollah has some buildings in Beirut, and now we're going to blow those up. And there [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1488.16s)]
*  happened to be a bunch of civilians there, too. It just shows you the kind of absurdity of this [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1491.3600000000001s)]
*  policy where they can take a position for a whole year that it would be bad if there's an Israeli [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1496.48s)]
*  ground invasion of Lebanon. And then when that policy happens, and the whole world has heard you, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1502.72s)]
*  and this is why this matters, it gets the U.S. credibility. The whole world has heard you say [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1508.0s)]
*  for a year, that would be bad. And by the way, when they were asked, isn't your policy failing, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1511.52s)]
*  they would point to this as a success, right? To your point. And now that the thing that you [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1515.92s)]
*  didn't want to have happen is happening, you're for it? There's something completely absurd about [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1520.24s)]
*  this. I mean, it's hard to think of a superpower looking less like a superpower when they can just [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1526.8799999999999s)]
*  switch on a dime like that because they don't want to be in a different place than Bibi Netanyahu. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1533.2s)]
*  You know? That's the first thing. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1538.0s)]
*  And the State Department is urging U.S. citizens to leave Lebanon now. They're saying use commercial [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1540.0s)]
*  flights, get on U.S. brokered options, because the U.S. brokered options will not be able to [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1544.8799999999999s)]
*  continue indefinitely. So now we're scrambling to get our own people out of there. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1550.48s)]
*  Yeah, which I was going to say, and I'm going to bring politics into this, too. We talk a lot about [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1553.52s)]
*  the Arab population in Michigan. It is primarily Lebanese, right? And so this is a population [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1559.76s)]
*  that was already upset about what was being done in Gaza just out of kind of solidarity. And yes, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1565.52s)]
*  there are a lot of Palestinian Americans in Michigan, too. But now, the war is coming to [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1570.72s)]
*  their families. And I should say I'd like to see the U.S. doing more to evacuate Americans. In 2006, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1576.32s)]
*  they were putting people on U.S. military ships and taking them out of there. And it doesn't seem [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1583.84s)]
*  to be at that level yet, either. And the thing that concerns me is that there's always a reason [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1589.36s)]
*  to kind of continue. So you go in and let's say, hey, there's some rocket sites that we want to [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1593.36s)]
*  take out in southern Lebanon. And then Israel goes in, and then somebody fires at them from [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1598.48s)]
*  somewhere else. And then they say, oh, we have to go get those people who are firing at us from [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1602.56s)]
*  somewhere else. And then it's like, well, then we have to get where they're manufacturing or... [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1606.72s)]
*  There's a mission creep that happens constantly. That's what happened in 1982 when Israel ended [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1610.96s)]
*  up occupying Lebanon for a very long time, or parts of it. And I just... Where is this ending? [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1615.76s)]
*  I was talking to somebody here in L.A. who is from Lebanon, has a lot of friends there, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1623.84s)]
*  a lot of family there. He's Druze, who are sort of a unique ethnic religious group in Lebanon. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1628.96s)]
*  But not Hamas. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1636.4s)]
*  Not Hamas, right. But not part of the Shia population, not Sunni, not the Christian. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1637.28s)]
*  They're 5% of the population. And he was saying that their friends just feel trapped. They're [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1642.32s)]
*  trapped in the middle. Lebanon has just lurched from crisis to crisis to crisis, from war to [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1647.44s)]
*  economic crisis, now to a political crisis. And they don't want the war to continue, but they're [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1652.8799999999999s)]
*  also scared if it stops. Because if it stops and Hezbollah is still in charge, you're going to have [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1659.04s)]
*  this weakened but not toppled terrorist but political group trying to reassert its domination [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1664.4s)]
*  over the country. Well, that's the thing. Yeah. The risk of civil war conflict or bombings [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1672.24s)]
*  is just going up. The more things get destroyed, the more the stakes go up and the more... [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1679.2s)]
*  And meanwhile, I was talking to some Lebanese Americans who were describing their families [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1683.3600000000001s)]
*  have no idea where to go in Beirut. Right? So- [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1687.8400000000001s)]
*  No where to go. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1689.76s)]
*  Do they go and just try to hang out close to the American embassy because it might not get bombed? [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1690.4s)]
*  That's the degree of calculation people are having to make in Beirut, like a major world city. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1694.88s)]
*  Yeah. And you had all these sort of sectarian neighborhoods and now all these people are [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1699.3600000000001s)]
*  getting displaced and squeezed together. And that could end very badly. And you're right, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1702.24s)]
*  there is so much of the Western media coverage and talk about foreign policy or places like Gaza. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1706.3200000000002s)]
*  The people get otherized. You cannot do that about Beirut. This is a place where all these [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1713.52s)]
*  reporters have gone to hang out and party. Anyway, it's just awful. And also there has been this [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1720.16s)]
*  horrible government crisis for years, but you're hearing American and Western officials [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1728.0800000000002s)]
*  talk about this like it's some moment of opportunity for Lebanon. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1735.28s)]
*  Never works. Never works. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1739.6000000000001s)]
*  What the fuck are we doing? It's like a rock. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1740.48s)]
*  How many times do you have to see in the Middle East that if you blow everything up and then say, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1741.52s)]
*  well, what a great opportunity to get the right kind of person in charge here- [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1745.68s)]
*  Seize control from the pesky blow. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1749.2s)]
*  That never works. Point me to the Middle Eastern country that has emerged from being broken apart [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1750.16s)]
*  by violence in some democracy flourishing way. I can't believe we're back here. It's the same [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1755.28s)]
*  fucking people that said that about Iraq or saying this about Lebanon today. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1764.72s)]
*  I know. I've had people say this to me about the moment of opportunity for Iran, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1767.76s)]
*  of decapitating the snake in Iran. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1773.28s)]
*  What an opportunity. What are these people talking about? [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1774.96s)]
*  It's like baseball cards that they're trading here. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1778.48s)]
*  Yeah. I guess there was some reporting that the US was told by Israel that they intend to wrap up [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1780.48s)]
*  the Lebanon operation in the coming weeks. We've heard that before. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1785.52s)]
*  Maybe right after our election. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1788.24s)]
*  Yeah. Hopefully it's true. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1789.68s)]
*  And Bibi does his best for Trump. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1790.96s)]
*  Yeah. Gives him attaboy. Finally, last bucket of this Middle East talk here, Ben. So on Iran [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1793.52s)]
*  itself. So it's been two weeks to the day that we're recording this since Iran fired the 180 [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1799.3600000000001s)]
*  ballistic missiles at Israel. We've been waiting for some sort of response from the Israelis ever [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1803.92s)]
*  since. There was some reporting today or this week that Biden called Netanyahu as their first [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1807.92s)]
*  talk in like seven weeks. And Biden got some assurances from Netanyahu that any response [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1814.24s)]
*  will focus on military targets in Iran, not on their nuclear facilities or oil infrastructure. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1819.52s)]
*  We'll see. The Wall Street Journal reported that Iran has warned, I guess, like Western or Gulf [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1824.48s)]
*  leaders, that if the Israelis hit them, they will respond to any attack by hitting Israel's [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1830.72s)]
*  civilian infrastructure and they will retaliate against Arab states that facilitate the attack. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1836.32s)]
*  So they will obviously they'll grow this thing immediately. They'll expand the war that is. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1841.6799999999998s)]
*  To bolster Israel's air defenses, Biden sent a FAD missile defense system to Israel along with [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1848.6399999999999s)]
*  about 100 US military personnel to man it. And also on the Iran front, the New York Times was given [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1854.08s)]
*  minutes of 10 meetings between Hamas's top leaders who planned the October 7th attack in Gaza. This [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1860.96s)]
*  is like what they talked about and all their planning over the course of several years. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1867.6s)]
*  These notes were apparently found on a computer that was recovered by the IDF in Gaza. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1871.6799999999998s)]
*  The meetings reportedly show that Hamas did in fact brief both Iranian officials and Hezbollah [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1875.9199999999998s)]
*  on the October 7th attack before it happened and tried to get them to participate. The report said [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1882.72s)]
*  Hamas leaders came away from these discussions thinking that Iran was supportive in principle. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1888.56s)]
*  But we all saw what happened kind of that day that week. Hezbollah participated in the attack [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1893.28s)]
*  in kind of a limited fashion with some limited rocket attacks. After the attack, Iran didn't [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1898.56s)]
*  get involved directly until after the Israelis bombed the Iranian embassy in Damascus and killed [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1904.56s)]
*  two IRGC generals. Obviously over the years, Iran has given lots of money and material support and [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1910.1599999999999s)]
*  weapons and training to both Hamas and Hezbollah. But Hamas was not talking about that. They were [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1915.28s)]
*  trying to get them to engage and fight with them that day, blow up Israeli military infrastructure [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1919.28s)]
*  at the start of the attack. So it's worth reading this piece in full because there's lots of [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1927.2s)]
*  interesting detail in there. But also I came away from reading it very nervous that the leak was [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1931.52s)]
*  part of the messaging effort to kind of preemptively justify or explain some sort of major Israeli [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1936.24s)]
*  response against Iran. Yeah, I mean it was a complicated leak because on the one hand, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1943.52s)]
*  it's very alarming if Iranian officials had some notion that there was an attack being planned [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1949.12s)]
*  on October 7th. But they also, on the other end, they clearly chose not to participate. So it's [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1958.48s)]
*  kind of a murky picture, but obviously a damning one just for them having foreknowledge. My [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1966.0s)]
*  experience over the years with Iran is that the proxy that they had the most kind of control over [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1973.12s)]
*  was Hezbollah. That Hamas was kind of in a category like the Houthis where they gave them money and [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1977.84s)]
*  weapons because it kind of suited them, but they weren't pulling all the strings. And they weren't [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1983.28s)]
*  like ideologically aligned. Yeah, they're Shia and they're Sunni. So this is a bit complicated. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1987.6799999999998s)]
*  But I think you're right. Where could those documents have come from? I mean, clearly this [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1994.08s)]
*  was an effort to kind of message around Iranian complicity to some extent, which suggests perhaps [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=1998.48s)]
*  like a justification for a bigger military operation against Iran. Who knows what we'll [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2004.88s)]
*  see happen? I mean, one thing I will say, Tommy, is that one thing the Israelis under Netanyahu [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2011.3600000000001s)]
*  are good at is they act like they might do something really over the top. The U.S. spends [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2018.48s)]
*  a lot of time trying to talk them out of doing it. And then they do something that would have [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2028.16s)]
*  been seen to be really dramatic, but it seems like less. So it's like, I can see a world in which [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2031.8400000000001s)]
*  they might launch a pretty significant military attack on Iran, but not hit the nuclear facilities [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2037.76s)]
*  and oil fields. And the Biden people are saying, oh, we talked them out of that. Kind of like the [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2042.48s)]
*  RAFA operation. Well, they didn't destroy all of RAFA. At once. Now it looks more limited. But yeah, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2046.64s)]
*  you know, and beware of this. We've seen this happen repeatedly since October 7th. The generals [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2053.76s)]
*  plan may fall in that category. Here's our plan to depopulate Gaza. And then the U.S. spends a lot [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2062.0s)]
*  of time. And then they think they kind of talk them down from doing something, when in fact Israel [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2067.84s)]
*  still escalating what they're doing. And that kind of feels to me like where we are right now. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2072.08s)]
*  But you know, they seem pretty determined, the Israelis, to kind of [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2076.56s)]
*  use this window to degrade the Iranian network, including the Iranian regime itself, as much as [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2080.96s)]
*  possible. The question again is what emerges on the back end of that? Because you're not going to [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2088.08s)]
*  eliminate it entirely. And you're going to buy a lot of ill will in the process, not just among [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2092.56s)]
*  those groups, but globally. And that's the trade off that the Israelis seem to be comfortable. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2097.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's worth reading the story. Lots of interesting details. No Judy Miller on the [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2102.24s)]
*  byline, but it did get my spidey senses, anxiety about leaks popping up. Another one though, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2105.76s)]
*  on the Iran front, Politico had a long report about what they described as Iran's hit list [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2111.84s)]
*  of former Trump aides and the challenges the U.S. is having protecting all of them. So these are all [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2116.0800000000004s)]
*  Trump officials connected to the 2020 assassination of IRDC leader Qasem Soleimani. Politico describes [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2121.1200000000003s)]
*  the threat as a pervasive assassination threat that is much more concrete than the graphic videos, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2127.28s)]
*  brash proclamations and menacing social media posts that have found their way into the public eye. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2132.16s)]
*  Congress has been briefed on all this. There are like 24 sources quoted in the story, current, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2137.52s)]
*  former and congressional. Congress appropriated a bunch of money to protect some of these individuals, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2141.3599999999997s)]
*  especially the former state and DOD people. But not everyone in particular, it sounds like the [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2146.08s)]
*  NSC staff, the White House staff who are asking for secret service coverage, but secret service, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2151.92s)]
*  as we've discussed, is having a hard time protecting Trump at the moment, so they're [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2158.24s)]
*  spread a little thin. But apparently, again, it's another very long story. It sounds like the [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2162.3999999999996s)]
*  Iranians are doing extensive surveillance on all these individuals, just kind of like on the [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2167.8399999999997s)]
*  internet. They're trying to get access to their schedules, figure out where they are. There was an [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2171.9199999999996s)]
*  anecdote about some Trump official who was in Paris who was like tailed by a couple of dudes that [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2175.3599999999997s)]
*  freaked out a security detail. Obviously, this list of people they would like to respond to, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2180.64s)]
*  the Iranians would like to respond to, includes Donald Trump, who has decided that Iran is [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2186.56s)]
*  responsible for the two assassination attempts on him in this presidential cycle. He apparently [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2191.52s)]
*  has requested- Which is crazy, which is crazy. Which seems very unlikely, at most unproven. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2197.2799999999997s)]
*  He's requested military aircraft and military vehicles to take him from place to place in the [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2203.2799999999997s)]
*  final weeks of the campaign because of these Iranian threats. I guess, I can't tell if this is [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2208.0s)]
*  a real thing, if this is his staff just trying to call Biden weak, if they feel like the Secret [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2213.84s)]
*  Service isn't up to the job. I don't know. What did you make of the story? [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2220.32s)]
*  Well, first of all, this goes back to the assassination of Qasem Soleimani. The Trump [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2224.32s)]
*  administration assassinates Qasem Soleimani, who is this revered leader of the IRGC, the Iranian [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2230.1600000000003s)]
*  Revolutionary Guard Corps. On the one hand, the idea that Iranians have long memories, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2237.12s)]
*  will want to avenge the killing of Qasem Soleimani, that rings true. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2246.08s)]
*  On the other hand, and I've said a version of this before, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2254.4s)]
*  it may be that there are some IRGC guys who like to get together and put together lists of people [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2258.96s)]
*  that they don't like. Intelligence picks that up. How concrete this threat is remains unclear. It's [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2264.16s)]
*  kind of murky when you read that story. What is aspirational? We might like to do this someday, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2272.7999999999997s)]
*  versus actually trying to do it is a different thing. I take it seriously. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2278.24s)]
*  I mean, we haven't seen ... I take it seriously, but we've yet to see them try to do this. It may [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2284.32s)]
*  also be that they want these people to just live with some degree of fear. This is not me trying [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2291.92s)]
*  to diminish it. It's just saying- That would be awful. Terrifying. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2298.4s)]
*  Yeah. They may not mind the US is picking up, oh, we might have designs on these 24 people. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2300.32s)]
*  I want John Bolton and Robert O'Brien or whomever it is to be uncomfortable. Maybe we have some guys [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2309.12s)]
*  tail somebody in London just to ... I think that may be happening too, is just a sense of intimidation [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2316.88s)]
*  and planting a seed in people's heads. If you go all in and trying to end a regime, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2323.68s)]
*  like the Iranian regime, precisely because there are people in that regime that play a version of [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2330.16s)]
*  hardball, I take the threat seriously and all the US can do is follow the intelligence picture [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2334.48s)]
*  and do what it can. I do think there's a chance, and I hope this is the case, that these are not [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2340.88s)]
*  very advanced plots. These are aspirational, meant to intimidate and not to actually do something. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2348.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. I hope that's the case. I hope that's the case. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2354.2400000000002s)]
*  I can totally understand how if you were a senior director on the NSC, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2355.92s)]
*  you have ... and that Iran decided that you are part of this assassination plot and they've added [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2360.56s)]
*  you to this list and you're getting warned by the FBI about these threats or surveillance on you, [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2365.28s)]
*  but you have absolutely no resources to protect yourself, short of something you fund out of your [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2369.84s)]
*  own pocket. That is terrifying, and I truly do feel for these people. I find it very hard to [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2375.6s)]
*  believe that because of a threat from Iran, that the US Secret Service can't adequately defend [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2380.96s)]
*  Donald Trump and then he has to drive around Milwaukee in an MRAP and then fly back to Mar-a-Lago [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2385.76s)]
*  in an F-22. This is just absurd. It seems like posturing. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2390.5600000000004s)]
*  This is totally different. Break, break. I'm not comparing it apples to apples. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2394.5600000000004s)]
*  My only experience of something strange happening after I left the White House is when [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2399.6000000000004s)]
*  it came out in the news that I was getting spied on by a bunch of former Mossad guys, Black Cube. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2404.2400000000002s)]
*  They were trying to dig up dirt on me. They had files on me. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2410.8s)]
*  I remember just feeling like when you're in the White House, you have all this juice. I had [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2415.76s)]
*  Secret Service protection at times because of right-wing death threats in this country, [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2420.96s)]
*  but your former White House official is like, you're on your own, man. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2425.6800000000003s)]
*  You're gone. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2428.48s)]
*  I was like, who do I call? I called John Brennan. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2429.2000000000003s)]
*  You walk out that gate and you're like, see you. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2431.28s)]
*  I remember calling Brennan and being like, hey, can I do anything with this Black Cube thing? He's [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2432.6400000000003s)]
*  like, I'm not the CIA director anymore. There's not a former White House official hotline to call, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2435.36s)]
*  which sucks. I feel bad. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2442.32s)]
*  The private protection is incredibly expensive. Mitt Romney talked about paying hundreds of [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2444.64s)]
*  thousand dollars a month for protection from mega people, basically. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2448.88s)]
*  He does have the money. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2453.52s)]
*  Mick can pay for it. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2454.24s)]
*  Maybe Mick can donate. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2455.68s)]
*  Not a bad idea. A couple other things, Ben. We're going to add North Korea to our basket of problems [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2458.3199999999997s)]
*  that are steadily getting worse at the moment. It was not long ago that we covered the bags of trash [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2463.68s)]
*  that North Korea was floating over the border into South Korea. The tit for tat between North [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2470.08s)]
*  and South continues with the North taking this, it's largely symbolic, but very provocative step [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2475.44s)]
*  of literally blowing up roads and railroad tracks meant to connect North and South Korea. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2480.96s)]
*  As you can imagine, the roads were not in use, but they were part of this project [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2486.88s)]
*  started in the 2000s that was designed to eventually connect the two countries. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2490.72s)]
*  For decades, North Korea claimed they wanted to reunify the peninsula, but Kim Jong-un changed [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2495.04s)]
*  the policy officially back in January, calling the South an invariable principal enemy. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2501.04s)]
*  The road destruction came after North Korea accused the South of dropping all these [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2506.6400000000003s)]
*  propaganda leaflets over Pyongyang via drone. I don't think that South Korea's declined to [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2510.7200000000003s)]
*  confirm if they're responsible in response to the South fire at some warning shots near the [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2516.32s)]
*  border, et cetera. It's like this constant tit for tat. But then I think blowing up the roads, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2520.56s)]
*  obviously, is bad news for anyone who supports reunification. It's bad for anyone that's worried [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2526.16s)]
*  about the nuclear risk from North Korea, but it also comes in this broader context in this moment [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2530.56s)]
*  where North Korea is giving Russia all these artillery shells in support for the war in Ukraine [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2535.84s)]
*  in exchange of getting some kind of military technology. I think people assume it's [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2542.48s)]
*  ballistic missile program help. Then just this week, there's reports that North Korea [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2547.2s)]
*  sent troops to Russia to fight against Ukraine. This was in the Washington Post. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2553.8399999999997s)]
*  Ukrainian intelligence officials said there are several thousand North Korean infantry soldiers [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2558.88s)]
*  in Russia now getting trained. It was not clear to me reading this piece if they're going to get sent [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2563.04s)]
*  to the front lines or if they're just there to maintain North Korean equipment that's old and [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2568.56s)]
*  shitty and probably needs a lot of work. But it seems like a hell of an escalation. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2574.24s)]
*  Well, it's starting to get like World War vibes. I mean, I shat out on the Iran piece. I noticed [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2579.7599999999998s)]
*  the Iranian president went to visit Putin. These countries are getting closer, Iran, Russia, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2586.64s)]
*  North Korea, China. And yeah, if you suddenly have North Korean guys on the front lines or [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2593.04s)]
*  are doing anything, frankly, in Russia, that's a massive change for North Korea that the so-called [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2597.8399999999997s)]
*  hermit kingdom walled off in the world. I mean, that's Kim kind of flexing a bit, [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2602.0s)]
*  but that's this kind of intermingling of Russia, North Korea. And it's not just an alliance of [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2606.16s)]
*  convenience. It seems to be more like an alliance now. And yeah, you wonder what the North Koreans [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2611.28s)]
*  are getting. Ballistic missile technology, Russians have a lot of intelligence. There's all kinds of [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2616.8s)]
*  things they could be getting. And I'd watch this space because no matter who wins, I think we're [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2621.52s)]
*  in for a bumpy year with the North Koreans because I've said before, if Trump wins, [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2627.52s)]
*  Kim's going to feel pretty emboldened to fuck around with the South Koreans. Yeah, these boys [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2632.96s)]
*  in the White House, they love each other. But if she wins, the North Koreans have a pattern of [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2636.96s)]
*  testing new US presidents. If you go back and look, when Obama came in, there were missile tests. And [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2642.88s)]
*  when Trump came in, remember, you had the whole rocket man thing. And so I just feel like we're [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2648.88s)]
*  headed for a little more attention on North Korea than we ever want to give. But the mega [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2654.88s)]
*  trend I'm watching is that the kind of absence of diplomatic de-escalation in any of these theaters [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2660.4s)]
*  seems to be kind of thickening this anti-Western alliance in ways that are pretty worrying. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2666.4s)]
*  Yeah. One other story that we've been watching for a while now is about the assassination of a sick [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2673.52s)]
*  separatist named Hardeeb Singh Najjar on Canadian soil in June of 2023. I should say he was like an [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2679.6s)]
*  alleged separatist. He was just kind of an activist in the space. Canadian Prime Minister [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2685.68s)]
*  Justin Trudeau, his government accused the Indian government led by Narendra Modi of being behind [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2690.96s)]
*  the assassination. And now the fallout from this case is growing and growing as the Canadian [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2696.08s)]
*  government says they have evidence of a much wider campaign of targeting Indian dissidents happening [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2702.0s)]
*  in Canada. An investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police found at least one other murder, [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2707.52s)]
*  drive-by shootings and a home invasion carried out by a gang that was allegedly being fed [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2714.0s)]
*  intelligence by Indian diplomats in Canada, who would also use threats of denying immigration [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2718.88s)]
*  documents to get Indians living in Canada to become informants for them. And Canadian officials [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2724.96s)]
*  are saying that all of this is being directed by people at very high levels of the Indian government. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2729.84s)]
*  This Monday, the Canadian government expelled six Indian diplomats who they said were involved [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2735.12s)]
*  in gathering intelligence on sick activists, including the most senior Indian diplomat in [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2739.92s)]
*  Canada. Here's what Trudeau said about it all at a press conference. Let me be clear. The evidence [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2744.72s)]
*  brought to light by the RCMP cannot be ignored. It leads to one conclusion. It is necessary to [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2751.04s)]
*  disrupt the criminal activities that continue to pose a threat to public safety in Canada. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2759.68s)]
*  That is why we acted. Because we will always, first and foremost, stand for the rights of Canadians [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2766.08s)]
*  to feel safe and secure in their own country. We will never tolerate the involvement of a foreign [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2774.0s)]
*  government threatening and killing Canadian citizens on Canadian soil. A deeply unacceptable [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2781.3599999999997s)]
*  violation of Canada's sovereignty and of international law. So we should say the Indian [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2789.28s)]
*  government denies everything. They also expelled six Canadian diplomats because why not? Either way, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2795.44s)]
*  it's a new low between the two countries. Again, just the broader context here, if people were like, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2801.84s)]
*  what is happening? The people being targeted by the Indian government allegedly support [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2806.5600000000004s)]
*  the sick separatist movement in the creation of an independent six state. There is absolutely [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2812.2400000000002s)]
*  zero risk of that happening. The movement is banned in India. There is no chance this is [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2818.4s)]
*  going to happen. But the Indian government is still jeopardizing its relationship with some of the [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2823.6800000000003s)]
*  most powerful countries in the world. For what? What is the point of this? [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2829.6800000000003s)]
*  A couple of things on this. First of all, if you read the accounts of this, the Canadians briefed [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2835.36s)]
*  out this is very specific evidence that they had. These are like intercepts. They were quite specific [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2840.96s)]
*  on background in detailing what looks like a very robust intelligence picture. Frankly, [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2846.8s)]
*  intelligence pictures suggest that these Indian diplomats were not exactly being that careful [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2854.32s)]
*  in covering their tracks. They're surveilling people. They're talking about it. Why would they [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2860.48s)]
*  make this up? It is not in their interest. It's not fun to have a fight with a country of over a [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2868.1600000000003s)]
*  billion people that is really important geopolitically. You don't be scolded by Trudeau. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2872.88s)]
*  It would suck. I feel like an asshole. The first point is that this feels pretty [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2876.72s)]
*  clear that this happened. Also, I have to say, good for the Canadian government. One thing you [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2880.56s)]
*  can do with autocracy is just call it out and be transparent about what you know. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2888.9599999999996s)]
*  I wish the United States was backing them up more. I know we have this big geopolitical play with [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2896.72s)]
*  Modi. He's part of our China strategy. He's in multiple quads and things like that. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2902.08s)]
*  It's not acceptable to basically be weaponizing your diplomatic service to kill people or [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2907.6s)]
*  surveil people or intimidate people like this in Canada. It's crazy. I'm glad that they are [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2913.2799999999997s)]
*  calling this out and that they're not self-censoring and handcuffing themselves because [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2920.0s)]
*  India is an export market or because India is part of some China strategy. I'd like to see [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2926.2400000000002s)]
*  the G7, the US, other groupings of countries backing this up. This leads me to the last point, [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2932.16s)]
*  which is to your point about why are they doing this. Listeners to this podcast know [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2938.16s)]
*  we're not huge fans of ethno-nationalism here. I just don't like this. You get a sense that Modi [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2944.2400000000002s)]
*  thinks he's the prime minister of all Indians everywhere. Even if you're not in India, [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2954.56s)]
*  even if you're not even a citizen of India, if you're Indian diaspora, he can silence you. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2960.72s)]
*  You're a part of his constituency. It's an incredibly nationalist view of things. By the [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2967.2s)]
*  way, the Chinese are doing the same thing. They've got multiple stories recently about they set up a [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2972.24s)]
*  police station in New York to monitor Chinese diaspora there. They clearly think that they're [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2978.32s)]
*  in charge of people and flushing queens who are Chinese. Those are people in the United States. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2985.52s)]
*  All you have to do is upgrade Eric Adams on a flight. You'll be good to go. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2990.56s)]
*  Yeah, and you can get whatever you want. This trend of nationalism is bad enough when it's [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2993.2000000000003s)]
*  within the borders of the country, but this globalization of nationalism, [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=2999.92s)]
*  that's what I think is going on here. Look, yes, countries have a right to say, [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3004.24s)]
*  I don't like something that somebody's doing there. They can bring that to the attention [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3009.3599999999997s)]
*  of the Canadian authorities if they think there's something criminal happening or something. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3013.12s)]
*  There's a threat to their national security. They have every right to do that. They could [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3016.3999999999996s)]
*  complain if the Canadians aren't acting on it, but what they can't do is run hit jobs on people. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3020.48s)]
*  So six, I think, are like 2% of the Canadian population. There's a dozen or so sick members [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3027.52s)]
*  of parliament. I wonder if that representation and that sort of sizable population kind of [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3032.88s)]
*  forced the government's hands. I think, yeah, they're an influential diaspora group in Canada. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3038.56s)]
*  But with you, they deserve credit for doing it. On your intelligence point, I mean, you're right. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3043.2000000000003s)]
*  There was a surprising amount of briefing about the nature of the intelligence, but also, [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3047.28s)]
*  Canada is a member of the Five Eyes. It's the US, the UK, New Zealand, Australia. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3052.8s)]
*  Doesn't necessarily mean that Canada intercepted all this stuff. It's interesting that all those [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3058.96s)]
*  countries have been sitting on this information to kind of try to work over how to deal with it. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3062.72s)]
*  I've always wondered about this since this first happened, which is, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3066.64s)]
*  because they spotlight the Royal Canadian Mounted Police or whatever. But you're right. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3070.72s)]
*  They're in this intelligence pool where everybody shares everything. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3076.08s)]
*  Don't you imagine dudes on horses holding up cones there? [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3078.56s)]
*  I think about, I remember the Untouchables when those dudes rolling on horseback and stuff. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3080.9599999999996s)]
*  So in my mind, I have a bunch of mustached Canadians. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3084.8799999999997s)]
*  We're the worst. We're the worst Americans. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3088.16s)]
*  But the reality is, if it is Five Eyes stuff, then what does the US think about this? [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3090.56s)]
*  And are we saying to the Indians, and look, I want to get along with India. I want the geopolitical [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3095.84s)]
*  thing to work out. But you have to have some lines here as to what is acceptable. And look, [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3100.6400000000003s)]
*  we can have the debate. I'm sure the Indian government might, what about this? And say, [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3109.04s)]
*  well, you guys do drone strikes in all these other countries. Fair debate. Let's all have the debate. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3112.7200000000003s)]
*  But this is kicking out six Canadians. I guarantee you those Canadians are not surveilling [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3118.16s)]
*  Indians to kill them. So it just kind of feels like a dumb tip for tap. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3125.2s)]
*  Yeah. Speaking of dumb things, just listening to that Trudeau clip, [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3129.8399999999997s)]
*  can everyone just stop saying, let me be clear? [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3133.6s)]
*  Obama is the guiltiest party, right? [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3136.64s)]
*  Kamala does it. Everyone stop doing it. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3138.96s)]
*  Trudeau's, by the way, we could come back to this after our election. He's had some challenges. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3141.2799999999997s)]
*  He's had a rough couple months. Yeah. I think he just survived his second no confidence vote. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3145.2799999999997s)]
*  It was like a bullshit one by the conservatives that had no chance of passing. But that also came [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3150.08s)]
*  after the New Democratic Party, the kind of Bernie Sanders wing of Canadian politics. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3154.64s)]
*  Led by a Sikh politician. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3159.68s)]
*  Yeah. But pulled out of their kind of deal with Trudeau's party. I think Trudeau's approval rating [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3160.7999999999997s)]
*  is down in like the 30 to 35% range, which in some ways is impressive because he's been in charge [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3167.52s)]
*  for nine years, including from the pandemic until now. And basically every incumbent is getting [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3173.52s)]
*  killed in the polls. Yeah. You pointed that out. I mean, the pandemic has not been good for [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3179.28s)]
*  incumbents. People are pissed off. Yeah. Finally, Ben. So it's not often that you see [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3186.0s)]
*  a world leader just get like dunked on straight to their face. But Moritz Koerner, who's a German [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3192.72s)]
*  member of the European Parliament, shot his shots verbally. Last week, Victor Orban gave a big speech [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3198.64s)]
*  to the parliament in Strausburg, which itch received what the New York Times called a hostile [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3205.3599999999997s)]
*  reception. After his speech, Orban was forced to listen as a parade of lawmakers, including the [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3210.0s)]
*  European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen told him what they really thought of him. But [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3216.3199999999997s)]
*  Koerner went particularly hard in the paint. Let's hear a bit of a clip of what he had to say. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3220.8799999999997s)]
*  What a speech, Mr. Orban. What a speech. You say you want democracy and you brag about your [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3226.72s)]
*  majorities in the Hungarian parliament. Yet since years, you only rule by emergency decree. Are you [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3233.92s)]
*  so afraid of democracy, Mr. Orban? Mr. Orban, you are not a patriot. You are just a useful idiot of [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3241.44s)]
*  Russia and China. That's the reality. You turned Hungary into a banana Republic. You [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3250.08s)]
*  robbed your population and enriched your family and friends. Under your rule, Hungary has become [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3256.4s)]
*  one of the poorest and officially the most corrupt country in the EU. Thank you. What a fraud. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3264.64s)]
*  What a burden for your people. Mr. Orban, please step down to make Hungary great again. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3271.68s)]
*  There's something so funny. Oh, man. I want to start having a German accent when I- [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3278.0s)]
*  Dripping sarcasm in a German accent is so funny. I will tell you what I love about that is, [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3283.2799999999997s)]
*  my last book, I had this whole Orban section. What I love about that is that Orban has this [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3291.2s)]
*  JD Vance thing where he likes to think of himself as the smartest guy in the room, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3296.88s)]
*  and he likes to go to hostile audiences. To go on podcasts? [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3302.16s)]
*  Yes. I mean, yeah, we could see if he wants to come on. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3304.72s)]
*  Try. Go get him on. Because what I like about it is the useful idiot point, which is, [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3307.7599999999998s)]
*  you think you're such a fucking genius when actually you're just this kind of vessel for [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3312.56s)]
*  the Russians and the Chinese to get influence in the EU. Which is true, by the way. I mean, [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3316.8799999999997s)]
*  the Russians have all manner of agendas running through Orban. The Chinese, like Hungary has [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3320.56s)]
*  become part of their Belt Road thing, but Hungary is probably a massive Chinese intelligence base in [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3325.9199999999996s)]
*  the EU. This guy thinks he's this super intellectual JD Vance of Europe, thinking of the future of [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3330.72s)]
*  illiberal democracies, what he literally calls it, is actually just this guy who's a tool of [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3338.8799999999997s)]
*  these bigger foreign powers. It's a good way of cutting him down to size. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3344.16s)]
*  It's not just saying, hey, you're authoritarian. He doesn't mind that. What he minds is the idea [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3347.7599999999998s)]
*  that he's just kind of a tool. And it's all the better in a German accent. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3356.0s)]
*  You aren't even up to speed on the European Parliament's new rules of procedure. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3361.36s)]
*  You're full of emergency decree. Have you even read rule 243? [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3366.8s)]
*  I feel like we're going to get in trouble. Do you think this guy put himself in any danger? [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3372.32s)]
*  We just talked about the Indians whacking people in Canada. Is there any chance [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3376.4s)]
*  Orban would go after a German lawmaker? Because he's pretty ballsy. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3380.32s)]
*  One of the strange realizations I had when I was in Hungary working on that book is I met multiple [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3383.76s)]
*  people who had also been spied on by Black Cube. There was a great story, interesting story, [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3389.04s)]
*  of Black Cube spying on some OSF, Soros-funded NGOs. And the venue before the Hungarian election, [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3398.56s)]
*  shortly before the Hungarian election, they said there was this big conspiracy, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3410.08s)]
*  that there was a meeting in Germany where one of the people in these NGOs said something like, [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3414.4s)]
*  we want Orban out of there, which of course someone in an NGO wants. And guess where it [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3419.2799999999997s)]
*  showed up in the media? The Jerusalem Post. Interesting. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3424.3199999999997s)]
*  So there's this kind of weird relationship, because Orban's anti-Semite, but what Netanyahu [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3428.56s)]
*  really cares about is whether he's an ethnonationalist like Netanyahu is. And so there's [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3432.88s)]
*  this kind of strange symbiosis between Netanyahu and Orban and Black Cube is doing stuff. So it is [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3436.4s)]
*  possible that this guy could get spied on and stuff, but it's usually of that variety more than [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3443.92s)]
*  it is the Canadian Indian method. Well. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3448.96s)]
*  But I don't know. I hope they don't mess with him. He's young. He's like 34. He's from the sort of [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3454.2400000000002s)]
*  FDP party, which is the liberal political party in Germany. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3459.04s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. OK. Quick side note. I went on a trip with Josh Ernest. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3462.48s)]
*  Former White House president. Yes. In like 2005. It was after the Bush [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3469.92s)]
*  re-election. And it was one of these things where the FDP has a foundation and it was like an [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3475.36s)]
*  exchange. So they flew a bunch of young American political professionals to Germany to meet with [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3480.0s)]
*  the FDP. And what was really funny about it is that they're the libertarian party. And there are [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3484.88s)]
*  these people, astroturf people like Koch Brothers funded people, like, you know, 29 year olds [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3489.76s)]
*  running groups with names like Americans for Prosperity. And they wanted to love the FDP [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3497.1200000000003s)]
*  because they're libertarian. But they are true libertarians. And so the head of the FDP was a [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3502.2400000000002s)]
*  super charismatic gay guy who hated, you know, remember Bush ran on like banning gay marriage. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3510.7200000000003s)]
*  And this guy in the best German accent was like pounding on the table and like, [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3518.08s)]
*  what the fuck do you have against two men? And like all these guys who thought that they were [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3521.44s)]
*  there to like get you be Josh Ernest and I are like right there with this guy. Like, [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3525.7599999999998s)]
*  and he was like, fuck Putin. Like, what? Like this guy was like the best. Like, I wish I remember [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3530.64s)]
*  his name. I love that. But it was just like it was such a great like upending of expectations for all [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3535.84s)]
*  these Koch Brother funded people that all of a sudden have some gay German yelling at them about [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3540.24s)]
*  their Republican Party's policies on gay rights. Mr. Orban, you aren't even up to speed on the [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3544.48s)]
*  rules of procedure as enshrined in Article 232. Everyone on the couch is looking at us. Okay. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3550.32s)]
*  I think that's enough of us offending all our listeners. We love every exit of the AFD. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3557.2s)]
*  Also, you see the Hitler guy, the neo-Nazi who was, there was a neo-Nazi who was hiking near where [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3562.48s)]
*  like Hitler used to hike in his mountain retreat and he fell to his death. I did see that. A lot [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3568.56s)]
*  of bad Twitter about that. A lot of bad resistance Twitter, but it was interesting. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3572.8s)]
*  Yeah, it was interesting. Also interesting is after this speech, Orban's speech, a bunch of [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3576.48s)]
*  members of parliament serenaded him with a song called Bella Ciao, which is an Italian anti-fascist [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3582.2400000000002s)]
*  anthem. And at the end of the singing, or during the singing, the European parliament president said, [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3587.84s)]
*  this is not the Eurovision. But the good thing about all this is like the left and center left [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3593.6800000000003s)]
*  and libertarians are like stirred. They're awake in Europe. This is good. For a while, [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3599.52s)]
*  Orban counted on everybody not paying attention. I kind of like this. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3604.8s)]
*  I also like the tone. I like trolling and mocking and cutting down to size. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3609.84s)]
*  Yeah, you're not a strong man. You're just running Hungary into the ground on behalf of [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3614.88s)]
*  Victor Vladimir Putin. Amen. Okay. We're going to take a quick break. When we come back, you'll [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3619.04s)]
*  hear Ben's interview all about what it is like to run a news channel, a TV news channel, a news [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3623.6s)]
*  gathering organization in Afghanistan right now. So stick around for that. Before we're going to [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3629.92s)]
*  break, Ben, we're trying to do a lot of stuff here. We got a lot of great shows, trying to do [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3634.3199999999997s)]
*  some electoral work over at Vote Save America. And we're trying to build a little progressive [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3639.68s)]

*  miss this one. This is going to be good. Those are some really, really smart, thoughtful, [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3743.28s)]

*  on Saturday. Okay. I'm very pleased to be joined by Saad Mohseni, who for a long time ran Moby, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3762.4s)]
*  the kind of leading media outlet in Afghanistan over the course of 20 years, starting in 2002. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3770.56s)]
*  Saad has a new book out called Radio Free Afghanistan, a 20-year Odyssey for an independent [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3777.6800000000003s)]
*  voice in Kabul. It's great to see you. Thanks. Thanks, Ben. I still run it. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3782.32s)]
*  Well, yes, yes, yes. Yes, still run it. Yes, it's still there. Yes, absolutely. Well, actually, [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3787.12s)]
*  that kind of sets up the whole tenor of this book, which is what's extraordinary about it is it's [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3793.12s)]
*  your own story. It's the story of building this media enterprise, but in its own way, it's also [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3800.8s)]
*  a way of telling the story of what happened in Afghanistan over the course of the last two [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3806.72s)]
*  decades. And I want to start by going back in time. You had left Afghanistan in 1978 as a child [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3812.4s)]
*  and then returned in 2002 after the US-led invasion. And I just want to start by having [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3825.04s)]
*  you describe kind of what it was like to return. What was the Kabul that you found in 2002 like? [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3833.44s)]
*  Well, it was quite different to how we left it. And yet I remembered all the streets. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3840.16s)]
*  I had kept on going through Kabul for 23, 24 odd years. So I was familiar with all the roads and [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3847.68s)]
*  all the major streets. And yet the city itself had been totally destroyed by the Civil War of [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3857.7599999999998s)]
*  the 90s. And what was extraordinary was the people. They were like zombie-like, walking aimlessly. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3863.36s)]
*  And the city had shrunk from like 1.2, 1.5 million individuals to about 6, 700,000 people [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3870.08s)]
*  because of the Taliban. So it was quite jarring to return. It was the same old Kabul, yet quite [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3875.6800000000003s)]
*  different. Yeah. And we're going to get to Moby in a second here. And I'm just kind of curious. I mean, [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3881.6800000000003s)]
*  one of the interesting kind of points you make, which I heard frequently from people who visited [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3886.32s)]
*  I visited, but I visited in a giant security footprint. So I was kind of mindful. I wasn't [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3893.52s)]
*  seeing much except for Bagram Air Base and the kind of presidential palace compound and the embassy. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3898.08s)]
*  But you write about the kind of two Kabls, right? Like there was this kind of cosmopolitan, [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3903.84s)]
*  dynamic city with very entrepreneurial Afghans, a lot of international presence. But then that was [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3912.08s)]
*  kind of a city within a city. I mean, how did you see over the course of the international presence, [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3921.92s)]
*  the city around you evolving? Well, the initial changes were very much [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3931.6s)]
*  almost forced because there was so much money and there was so much engagement. There were so many [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3937.6s)]
*  NGOs and so many embassies. And it seemed a little artificial, but over time it became quite organic. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3941.76s)]
*  And you have to remember, Ben, that the country's population doubled from 2001 to 2021 to 22. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3949.6s)]
*  Today's Afghanistan population is at 42 million. It's still growing at 3% per annum. So half the [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3957.2s)]
*  country wasn't even born in 2001. So we've seen this huge transformation of the country. It's [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3964.24s)]
*  become vastly organized. People are much better educated. Literacy rates have more than doubled. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3969.92s)]
*  But of the younger generation of Afghans, the under 30s, the great majority are educated. A lot [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3976.96s)]
*  of them have been to universities. So it's a transformed country. And through this book, [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3983.04s)]
*  I try to tell the story of this new Afghanistan, this transformed Afghanistan. A lot of people [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3989.12s)]
*  view Afghanistan as a complete and total failure. But for the people, I think it was a huge success. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=3994.64s)]
*  Well, yeah, I want to talk about the people because Moby was such an interesting... I [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4001.52s)]
*  remember when I was in the White House for eight years, you kind of looked to that as [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4006.64s)]
*  an independent news source and kind of barometer of what was going on. But what's interesting, [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4012.56s)]
*  and you obviously tell the story in the book, it wasn't just news. You had soap operas. You had [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4016.8799999999997s)]
*  very popular singing competition. And I'm wondering, Afghanistan is such a diverse country [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4023.52s)]
*  in the sense that you have some deeply religious Muslim population communities. You have different [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4030.4s)]
*  ethnic groups. You have obviously an urban-rural divide like other countries. As you're kind of [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4038.56s)]
*  developing programming, talk a little bit about how you took into account the kind of diversity [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4044.88s)]
*  of the audience that you were seeking to appeal to. And in programming, how did you kind of get to [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4051.12s)]
*  know the Afghan people better, what they were interested in, what they wanted more of in terms [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4057.44s)]
*  of programming? Well, Afghanistan was obviously... Initially, access to media was quite low, except [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4062.56s)]
*  radio. Television was quite low. So it was a bit like the 1950s in the U.S. People started to get [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4071.12s)]
*  one television set for a house or for a community. So it was a single TV households we were directing. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4077.6s)]
*  So it had to be general entertainment that would appeal to the entire family. So we chose... [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4084.56s)]
*  skewed a little bit towards females. So we had lots of soap operas. We had variety shows. We had [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4091.04s)]
*  reality shows. We had these singing competitions like Afghan Star. We had sports. So it was... [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4098.32s)]
*  We had to take everyone into account. Obviously, even the rural-urban divide, initially we were [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4105.2s)]
*  targeting city dwellers, but we realized a lot of Afghans in smaller communities would also watch [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4111.04s)]
*  these programs. And some of these programs were hugely controversial, but people still watched [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4116.64s)]
*  them. So our viewership was... It continues to remain extraordinary. We're talking about 10, [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4122.4s)]
*  15 million people watch our sort of primetime programs, even to this day. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4128.16s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, did you feel like you were participating in the development of a kind of [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4134.16s)]
*  new form of national identity? I mean, it's interesting. I remember the Afghan Star, [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4139.92s)]
*  and I actually remember following the woman who won that at one point. She had an Instagram [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4145.92s)]
*  following. It was pretty enormous. She was kind of like... I don't know how to describe it to our [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4154.72s)]
*  listeners. It's not like the Afghan Kim Kardashian, but she would kind of wear Afghan security forces [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4158.88s)]
*  uniforms. But it just felt like if you went to Moby, it was the assertion, if the Taliban [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4165.84s)]
*  represents obviously a certain kind of identity, you seemed to be building a different kind of [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4172.72s)]
*  identity in what you were showing in the, obviously, the gender diversity on air. I mean, [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4179.76s)]
*  how conscious were you of being a venue for that kind of nation building, in a sense? [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4185.76s)]
*  Well, Afghans have a very strong sense of what it means to be an Afghan. They've always maintained [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4193.76s)]
*  that. I mean, Afghanistan was formed in the 1700s. So in terms of how people feel towards the country, [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4199.6s)]
*  it's pretty strong. I mean, there are different interpretations of what it means to be an Afghan, [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4208.16s)]
*  but there are some common themes which we managed to capture through our football league and the [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4213.76s)]
*  singing competition and so forth. There was always this need to unite. Even, for example, [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4221.04s)]
*  our travel shows when going through the different communities were hugely popular because people [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4229.44s)]
*  were rediscovering each other from different ethnic backgrounds and different parts of the country. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4233.68s)]
*  But a lot of the stuff that you saw on television, they were pretty organic. We were always very [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4240.4s)]
*  careful in terms of not imposing social change. We would facilitate social change, maybe give [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4247.04s)]
*  people a glimpse of what was possible, and it would step back. And I think sometimes we made [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4253.5199999999995s)]
*  mistakes. We pushed too far. But I think what we did was we weren't afraid to take risks. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4259.68s)]
*  And sometimes our decisions were hugely controversial, but we persisted. And I think [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4264.96s)]
*  we managed to fast track some of the changes that would have taken perhaps a couple of decades. We [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4269.92s)]
*  managed to achieve those in five or 10 years. Yeah. And now I want to pivot to talking a bit [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4275.84s)]
*  about obviously the war and the U.S. presence. You write with some understandable frustration [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4281.52s)]
*  about American officials who would tell you when you would point out problems, corruption. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4289.92s)]
*  Afghanistan is a sovereign nation as if the U.S. didn't have the capacity to, [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4297.68s)]
*  it wasn't kind of complicit in the corruption and some of the dysfunction in the government. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4302.48s)]
*  And I invite you to be as critical as possible because I'm highly mindful of [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4311.2s)]
*  the mistakes that the U.S. made along the way. Do you feel like, did U.S. officials listen to [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4318.88s)]
*  Afghans? I mean, when I look back on it, I kind of think to all these meetings I was in about [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4325.76s)]
*  Afghanistan where there were no Afghans present. And as I've gotten to know more Afghans over the [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4331.44s)]
*  years, they have very common complaints and critiques of things that the U.S. was doing, [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4338.48s)]
*  the kind of corrupt economy we were building, the dependency of Afghan security forces, [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4344.719999999999s)]
*  things like that. What was your sense of the willingness of American officials to listen to [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4348.24s)]
*  people like you who probably had a closer ear to the ground than certainly people back in [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4354.32s)]
*  Washington did? No, I think people did listen and were willing to listen. I mean, I think there were [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4359.68s)]
*  so many committed individuals who really cared about the Afghans and Afghanistan, and they [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4365.52s)]
*  continued to care about Afghanistan. Hundreds of thousands of Afghans were taken out of the airport. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4370.56s)]
*  A lot of the evacuation projects were funded by private individuals and foundations. And I think [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4376.56s)]
*  the reason why I'm continuing to talk about Afghanistan is that there was interest [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4384.72s)]
*  from members of the American public. I think the problem was, and I think someone mentioned [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4389.28s)]
*  this years ago, that America fought 20 different wars one year at a time. There were a series of [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4394.719999999999s)]
*  tactics, and there were no... I mean, no one sat back and said, listen, this is going to take us [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4402.719999999999s)]
*  20 years to achieve. So let's plan for this properly. And this was the problem, that a lot of [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4407.2s)]
*  the foundations of this new nation were not laid properly. And a lot of money was spent, but a lot [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4413.360000000001s)]
*  of that money was squandered. And I think, I mean, it's important to criticize the Americans, but I [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4419.84s)]
*  also could... I mostly criticize the Afghans for having squandered this enormous opportunity [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4425.84s)]
*  because of corruption, because of ineptitude. And it's important for us Afghans to look within and [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4433.4400000000005s)]
*  ask ourselves as to what we did wrong. So there are lessons, important lessons for us. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4440.4800000000005s)]
*  I think there was also too much money. I mean, I think we didn't have the capacity to absorb [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4445.280000000001s)]
*  that much assistance and that much help. Yeah. Well, I wanted to ask you, I mean, [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4449.4400000000005s)]
*  you have kind of detailed discussions around... You obviously had relationships with both Hamid [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4454.88s)]
*  Karzai and then Ashraf Ghani, the two presidents during this time. And you're particularly [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4461.04s)]
*  critical of Ghani at the end. What's your assessment of those two men and their performance? [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4469.6s)]
*  I mean, they have said, it's a tough job, president of Afghanistan. You're negotiating between foreign [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4478.4800000000005s)]
*  militaries and different constituencies in the country. You're dealing with an insurgency. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4485.04s)]
*  Like you said, it's hard to absorb all this funding. But what did you see in Karzai and Ghani? How do [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4490.320000000001s)]
*  you compare those two leaders? I think Karzai was an extraordinary leader, quite inspirational, [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4496.8s)]
*  and a true national figure, but a terrible manager. And Ashraf Ghani wasn't a particularly good [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4503.28s)]
*  manager. He was also a terrible leader and he never listened. I mean, one of the big flaws [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4509.92s)]
*  of Ashraf Ghani's was that he was inclined to be very didactic and would give a speech [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4516.16s)]
*  and lecture rather than listen to people. And it was quite frustrating dealing with both of them, [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4522.56s)]
*  to be honest with you. And of course, there was so much corruption and aptitude. I mean, [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4528.8s)]
*  we did a survey, I think in 2019 or 2020, the Taliban's approval rating was about 15%. But [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4533.28s)]
*  the government's approval rating was also around 17%. So the Afghan population, which by the way, [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4542.32s)]
*  continues to pay a price for its government even today, always paid this price. We were [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4549.2s)]
*  between a rock and a hard place. Yeah. Well, when things unraveled at the end in August of 2021, [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4558.48s)]
*  when did you have a sense that this was collapsing, that Kabul was going to follow [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4571.36s)]
*  the Taliban? And then how did you deal with the situation where on the one hand, [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4577.84s)]
*  you're covering this massive news event. On the other hand, I imagine, and you write about, [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4583.68s)]
*  you have employees that want to evacuate because they are worried about being targeted by the [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4588.08s)]
*  Taliban or they're worried about what Afghanistan is going to be like. How would you describe those [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4593.92s)]
*  weeks? Well, I mean, it's like a blur the last few months because we had a sense that the [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4599.68s)]
*  government was going to collapse. I was actually in Washington in July and I went to see Samantha [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4607.52s)]
*  Power. I went to see Jake. I went to see a whole bunch of other people. And I told them that this [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4613.84s)]
*  government's going to fall. And I was asked the question, when do you think? I said, by November. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4619.120000000001s)]
*  And everyone said, wow, you're being an alarmist by November of 2021. I said, absolutely, because [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4624.400000000001s)]
*  it was always going to be a case of lowering one flag and raising another flag. My assumption was [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4631.200000000001s)]
*  they would not fight as soon as they knew that the end was near. People were just going to switch [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4637.36s)]
*  sides. And then, of course, when it happened in mid-August, we were dealing with, you know, [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4642.08s)]
*  our biggest threat in those early weeks was we were losing our people every single day. They were [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4649.04s)]
*  going to the airport. And, you know, the news reader would show up at 10. By 11 o'clock, he was [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4654.639999999999s)]
*  out. The producer would show up at 11. He was out by 2 in the afternoon. So we were constantly [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4659.759999999999s)]
*  hiring people throughout the day and putting them in front of a television camera to read the news [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4665.84s)]
*  or to report on something. And what's extraordinary that Afghans had watched so much media that a lot [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4671.92s)]
*  of these kids just were like ducks to water. They were just very natural from like no experience [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4676.96s)]
*  to presenting to tens of millions of people. So it was a pretty... And we were worried about our [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4683.6s)]
*  people. And we were worried about our people at the airport. We were worried about our staff on [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4690.96s)]
*  the ground. This Taliban force, a bit sort of not dissimilar to a Martian, you know, an invading force [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4695.12s)]
*  from Mars had taken over the city and this country. And we didn't know what they were going to do with [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4703.68s)]
*  us. So I had very little sleep probably, you know, in all of August and all of September. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4708.4800000000005s)]
*  And what was it like just dealing with the Taliban in those initial days? You obviously [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4716.56s)]
*  employed women on air. And, you know, there were some dramatic moments that I remember even seeing. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4720.24s)]
*  I mean, how did you interact with the Taliban? How did they seek to impose their will on [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4731.44s)]
*  programming that obviously runs counter to their brand of Islam? [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4739.36s)]
*  You know, they were very careful and quite gentle in the way they conducted themselves. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4744.5599999999995s)]
*  And they were actually just as surprised as everyone else because I don't think they realized [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4750.24s)]
*  they would need to come into the city that quickly. As a matter of fact, when Ashraf Ghani fell and sort [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4754.8s)]
*  of he brought the whole thing to a head, the assumption was that there would be an interim [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4761.84s)]
*  arrangement and Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah were meant to go to Doha and negotiate with the Taliban. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4767.36s)]
*  But Ghani fleeing brought everything to a head. So they were quite surprised, just like the rest of us. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4772.719999999999s)]
*  So but, you know, our guys on the ground were just as cheeky. And, you know, they were pushing the [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4779.84s)]
*  envelope. The first time a Taliban official came to speak on television, they had a female reporter [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4784.64s)]
*  interviewer. But slowly we realized that, you know, we couldn't have music on, we couldn't have soap [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4792.72s)]
*  operas. But what's extraordinary is that, you know, Afghanistan obviously is a different Afghanistan [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4798.08s)]
*  to 2001. And I ask myself sometimes this question, it's almost like a race, you know, do we [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4802.88s)]
*  change them? Or would they or will they change us? And it's almost like a race because even today, [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4810.56s)]
*  if you look at Kabul, for example, or Masarachi for here are the major cities, you know, the Taliban [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4817.92s)]
*  are changing in the way that they interact with people the way they dress. They still there are [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4822.72s)]
*  a lot of females that work for government officers. In terms of implementation of their [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4829.12s)]
*  directives and decrees and so forth, there's quite a bit of a difference to Taliban 1.0. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4836.72s)]
*  The concern that we have is, you know, within the Taliban movement itself, that, you know, [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4843.68s)]
*  obviously it's not a monolithic movement. There are different views in terms of how they should [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4849.36s)]
*  govern the country. There's almost a race between the pragmatist and not so pragmatic Taliban, [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4856.24s)]
*  while there's also a race between the modern Afghanistan and the Taliban movement. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4863.36s)]
*  And we're seeing all of this play out on a day to day basis. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4868.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we recently had a woman named Sahar, Halam Zayon, who works for Malala and [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4871.84s)]
*  talking about obviously all of these different dictates that have come down, [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4877.76s)]
*  from the hardest line in the Taliban, obviously banning women from attending school, [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4881.92s)]
*  the kind of bringing back, you know, women can't speak in public, even extending to men, [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4891.92s)]
*  you know, men can't look at women who aren't in immediate relations in public spaces. I mean, [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4898.32s)]
*  you know, feels like a kind of, you know, iron, you know, I mean, Sahar used the term gender [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4905.92s)]
*  apartheid. And yet you also hear that there's this diversity in the Taliban. Some of the people at [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4910.48s)]
*  the local level are more pragmatic, are a little annoyed, frankly, by these really hardline [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4917.04s)]
*  dictates that make it harder to get international assistance. How should we understand what the [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4923.36s)]
*  Taliban is today? Because what we see is all the worst things that they're announcing. But then [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4928.16s)]
*  you hear from aid groups and others, well, there's this diversity in the movement. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4933.44s)]
*  How do you see that? Well, the situation on the ground is a lot more nuanced than how they appear [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4937.919999999999s)]
*  from the outside. So to answer your question, I mean, I think all of the above is true. And [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4944.48s)]
*  some villages and some towns, they're very conservative. They don't even allow TV cameras [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4951.28s)]
*  and press conferences. But then in a place like Kabul or the other major cities, or even some [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4959.52s)]
*  smaller villages, they're much more liberal. For example, Bamyan, you know, this historical city [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4964.88s)]
*  where the statues, the Buddha statues are destroyed in the 1990s. The governor is the same guy that [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4971.84s)]
*  destroyed the Buddha Bamyan's. And yet today, you know, 25 years on, he's much more liberal. He's [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4980.240000000001s)]
*  allowing some education at these vocational training centers, and he tolerates quite a degree [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4986.72s)]
*  of freedom enjoyed by the inhabitants of Bamyan. And tourists go and visit. So, you know, you're [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4993.52s)]
*  seeing differences in the way that these laws are being implemented. And that's why I said that, you [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=4999.84s)]
*  know, it has to converge at some stage. Either on the implementation side, they're going to become [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=5004.96s)]
*  much more strict, or they need to actually dilute these laws. And that's why I think it's important [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=5012.08s)]
*  for the world to engage, because they need to go and talk to these Taliban to make them understand [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=5017.6s)]
*  that there is a roadmap of sorts in terms of, you know, recognition and legitimacy and lifting of [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=5022.24s)]
*  sanctions, but they have to do certain things in order to get there. I mean, I'll give you an [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=5029.6s)]
*  example. They banned NGOs from hiring Afghan women. So the likes of the NRC, Jan Egeland was telling [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=5033.36s)]
*  me this, and I'm sure he wouldn't mind sharing this story. They went and met with the Taliban [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=5041.2s)]
*  across the country, and through negotiating with them and making them understand the importance of [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=5045.84s)]
*  foreign NGOs hiring female employees, that they could better serve Afghans. And as a result, [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=5052.24s)]
*  he told me this, like 65 to 70 percent of their women continue to work, even in the most conservative [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=5058.8s)]
*  communities, because they were able to convince these people on the ground. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=5064.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, yeah, that's a good... I mean, the last thing I wanted to ask you is, you know, to me, [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=5068.8s)]
*  the US, it feels like hasn't found a way to figure out, you know, its post-collapse of Kabul Afghan [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=5072.8s)]
*  policy. I mean, there are all these sanctions in place. There's, you know, there's some sense [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=5081.2s)]
*  that there's probably counterterrorism discussions happening because ISIS-K is a threat, and yet, [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=5085.5199999999995s)]
*  you know, I think the principal issue that is concerning to the US, you know, is the status [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=5090.16s)]
*  of women in Afghanistan, women and girls. What should we be doing differently? Which of the United [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O01znwM2ZjI&t=5095.44s)]
