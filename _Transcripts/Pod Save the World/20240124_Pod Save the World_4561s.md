They also talk about the UAE funneling weapons to Sudan, mass protests in Germany against the far-right ADF party, British conservative’s continuing attempts to send asylum seekers to Rwanda, Elon Musk’s visit to Auschwitz, and an odd auction item belonging to Winston Churchill.

*  Then you did our interview this week. What do we got? Yeah, so we talked about the situation in Ecuador last week [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=82.56s)]
*  wild situation obviously scary situation with you know gangs and drug cartels taking over TV stations and [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=88.52000000000001s)]

*  He was my negotiating partner on Cuba [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=103.78s)]
*  he was recently both an envoy to the Northern Triangle Central American countries and kind of [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=105.46000000000001s)]
*  You know principal deputy assistant secretary of state for the P das the P das but recently we're tired [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=111.28s)]
*  So liberated to speak his mind and come on this podcast and break down for us. What is going on in Ecuador? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=117.16000000000001s)]
*  He does a great job [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=123.68s)]
*  People should really check this out because he really unpacks exactly what's happening [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=125.16000000000001s)]
*  I learned a lot a lot of this points to like the massive power that has continued to grow for the Mexican cartels [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=128.6s)]
*  And then we also kind of put this in the context of what's happening more broadly in Latin American politics [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=137.04s)]
*  Which you know like everywhere else is not that great [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=141.96s)]
*  But also talked about what our potential solutions. How do we deal with the violence? How do we deal with the cartels? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=146.76s)]
*  So people should check it out [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=152.84s)]
*  newly made former [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=154.08s)]
*  Ex-officials are some of the best interviews because they have all the access to the same information still floating around their heads [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=155.66s)]
*  But now they can say whatever they actually you know what like you should that like you nailed it cuz like he like this first [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=160.74s)]
*  I was like what's going in Ecuador and said well? Let me tell you Ben what's going on Ecuador [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=165.76s)]
*  and it's like boom boom boom and [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=168.48s)]
*  Yeah, I'd ask the only thing I'd say Tommy's like you know we spent so much time. We'll do today [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=170.51999999999998s)]
*  I'm sure talking about things like Gaza the Middle East or Ukraine in a normal [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=174.28s)]
*  World which we haven't lived in for a while like what is going on with these cartels? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=178.6s)]
*  And in Mexico and in Ecuador would be massive stories [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=183.35999999999999s)]
*  So like it's worth putting our on it sometimes the one interesting thing about the Republican primary is how focused they are on [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=187.72s)]
*  Immigration yeah the politics, but also in the cartels and fentanyl and their solutions are insane which are basically understand [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=194.92s)]
*  Just saying let's just shoot at people indiscriminately. Yeah, they're not wrong about the problem and the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=201.48s)]
*  The way they're disrupting governments [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=206.6s)]
*  Oh, yeah, no to peel back the curtain here at crooked media a little bit [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=208.67999999999998s)]
*  I like stumbled out of this interview and into Favreau's office and or your office stupid you weren't there and was like [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  You have this [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=217.28s)]
*  This point right like it's not right to bomb Mexico [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=219.04s)]
*  But like it's not wrong to be like wait look at this. This is mess scary scary stuff [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=221.88s)]
*  I well I'm very excited to hear that and also recalls the good guy. Yeah, okay [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=227.0s)]
*  So let's go to Gaza Ben because there's been a lot of news since we last spoke so according to Axios [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=230.6s)]
*  Israel has proposed a ceasefire deal [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  That could include a two-month pause in fighting in exchange for the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=239.64s)]
*  The hostage release would happen in phases. It would be [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=245.2s)]
*  Women men over 60 years old and people with critical medical needs first then female soldiers [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=248.96s)]
*  Then men under 60 years old and then Israeli male soldiers and the bodies of hostages who have died [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=255.48s)]
*  So 130 hostages are still being held in Gaza [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=261.48s)]
*  But Israeli officials believe that several dozen died either on October 7th or in the days since in exchange Israel would obviously [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=264.2s)]
*  There would be this two-month ceasefire [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=271.92s)]
*  But they would also agree to release Palestinian prisoners who and how many would be determined via negotiations [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=273.76s)]
*  But you have to imagine a lot of them [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=279.92s)]
*  The proposal also includes some language about moving IDF troops out of major population centers and allowing civilians back into northern Gaza [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=282.08s)]
*  I have seen some reports that Hamas may have rejected this deal already and [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  Instead is asking for something much more maximalist like Israel ending the military offensive altogether getting all troops out of Gaza [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=294.48s)]
*  But hopefully that's a negotiating position and they're gonna work through it through the Qataris and the Egyptian mediators [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=302.36s)]
*  But these reports come after a whole bunch of stories about how the IDF military campaign is not going that well [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=308.84000000000003s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal said that US intelligence believes the IDF has only killed between 20 to 30 percent of Hamas's fighters and that Hamas [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=315.56s)]
*  Has enough weapons to keep going for months [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=322.84000000000003s)]
*  The Hamas tunnel infrastructure is reportedly way bigger than Israel anticipated [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=324.92s)]
*  They're saying like 300 400 miles worth of tunnels and then the New York Times reported that senior Israeli military officials [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=330.12s)]
*  increasingly think that the only way they're gonna get the remaining hostages freed is through negotiations and that the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=337.96s)]
*  You know the Netanyahu goal saying we're gonna free all the hostages and eradicate Hamas is impossible [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=344.36s)]
*  Seems like that was pretty clear from the beginning, but it's interesting that is leaking out [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=351.52s)]
*  So then yeah, I was under a ton of pressure from the families of the hostages to prioritize these talks on Monday [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=355.15999999999997s)]
*  Some of these hostages families broke into a Knesset Finance Committee hearing to protest [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=361.94s)]
*  So Ben, let's pause there. I mean, I'm glad to hear that these two sides are negotiating on a ceasefire [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=367.91999999999996s)]
*  How hopeful are you feeling about this getting done and then just generally anything else happening within Gaza that you've seen? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=373.96s)]
*  Well, look first of all, I think this may be the Israeli government [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=380.54s)]
*  Responding to the pressure they're under right they kind of put this out there publicly [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=386.3s)]
*  And so, you know, I think I don't know how serious like I hope it's good that there's at least, you know [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=390.58000000000004s)]
*  Diplomatic proposal on the table potentially but I'm not sure [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=398.46000000000004s)]
*  You know whether that's like a real thing or whether they just kind of felt the need [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=402.78000000000003s)]
*  To do something and put something out there because they're under a lot of heat [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=407.29999999999995s)]
*  these families [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=412.17999999999995s)]
*  So, you know welcome the idea that there might be some [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=413.7s)]
*  Negotiations and recognition that that's the only way to get the hostages out [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=418.14s)]
*  But you know, let's see what happens because sometimes you know [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=421.82s)]
*  They'll put stuff out there just to kind of make it seem like well actually we are open to this and we'll see and Hamas [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=426.5s)]
*  I mean who knows what their position is. I mean [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=431.35999999999996s)]
*  It may be that they you know, this conflict is grinded on for so long that they they kind of have moved on [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=435.08s)]
*  I hope not. I hope there's a space for negotiation there [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=440.44s)]
*  Stepping back though. I do think it's worth expressing some frustration here [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=443.35999999999996s)]
*  it was very clear and we said on this podcast at the beginning of this war like [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=447.84s)]
*  You know three months in to start to see headlines like, you know [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=453.91999999999996s)]
*  The idea is realizing that you can't achieve the objective of getting the hostages out [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=457.09999999999997s)]
*  Militarily is it's an obvious point [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=461.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean the the hostages get it got out only when there was a humanitarian pause and then a negotiation to get them out and [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=463.64s)]
*  And so I think what is clear from the lay down you did is both military objectives are unachievable [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=472.28s)]
*  And that's not like because these really if was the US military [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=480.4s)]
*  Those military objectives would be unachievable. Like you cannot learn that the hard way. Yeah, you cannot like militarily [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=484.08s)]
*  to defeat [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=489.64000000000004s)]
*  an organization like Hamas that has leaders out of the country that has you know, all you know has basically been in [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=491.76000000000005s)]
*  for the last decade plus like able to embed itself and [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=498.84000000000003s)]
*  In in Gaza build this tunnel network like as a benefactor in Iran. Yeah. Yeah, and in the [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=503.28000000000003s)]
*  diplomacy was gonna have to be a part of a salute because [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=509.88s)]
*  Look, they not only can they not do it militarily and you hear, you know, if the reporting is true [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=513.12s)]
*  they've only taken out 20 to 30 percent of the military wing of Hamas but like [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=517.12s)]
*  The lot what so even if you was a higher number than that, what would happen the day after this military operation ended, you know [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=521.5600000000001s)]
*  You obviously have a population in Gaza that has [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=528.48s)]
*  You know has been radical [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=531.84s)]
*  Not to impugn that population, but it's just like that [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=534.0s)]
*  Is that a sustainable solution like just leaving behind two million displaced people and one percent of the population was killed? Yeah, and so [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=536.72s)]
*  That's what I'd say, you know at least maybe there's a reckoning now in the Israeli government as there [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=544.16s)]
*  I think probably has already has been in the US government that this idea that a military operation is gonna [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=550.1s)]
*  You know rescue hostages and defeat Hamas [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=555.24s)]
*  You're setting militarily unachievable goals and it's the same thing. We're saying about the Houthis last week, right? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=558.36s)]
*  How do you cannot military defeat like a people like and that leads to my second point because it does feel like they're trying [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=563.52s)]
*  To kind of like militarily defeat not just Hamas that they're they're they're destroying Gaza and what you see [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=569.6400000000001s)]
*  Things that have jumped out to me last week right like blowing up universities like what is that about? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=577.32s)]
*  You know and even if they could say like well, there are some Hamas guys at that university [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=581.76s)]
*  Like they're controlled detonating and demolishing like the educational infrastructure in Gaza. Like what is the point of that, you know? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=585.24s)]
*  They're proposing [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=592.96s)]
*  We're creating like artificial islands [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=594.4s)]
*  I mean literally like the foreign minister of Israel presented this to the EU like [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=596.48s)]
*  Creating some artificial island off the coast of Gaza for like a vague purpose [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=600.4s)]
*  It was that screening stuff coming in but maybe moving people there like it then they're creating these buffer zones [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=604.12s)]
*  You know in the north [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=610.48s)]
*  kind of just destroying demolishing a lot of [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=613.0s)]
*  buildings to just kind of create some buffer space but like [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=616.92s)]
*  this this is like really chilling to watch because [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=620.0799999999999s)]
*  Absent like a clear military strategy to defeat the military wing of mosque the strategy seems to be [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=625.24s)]
*  just kind of leveling Gaza and and then not really having any plan for what you do after you level Gaza and [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=631.0s)]
*  That that that is that is the worst-case scenario like that continues to unfold [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=639.72s)]
*  Day after day, obviously most acutely in terms of the human suffering in Gaza, but also just strategically [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=645.28s)]
*  What is the objective of all this escalation like what it has to end somewhere, you know [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=651.34s)]
*  And and they don't seem to have any plan for where this ends the only people in Israel [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=655.7s)]
*  In the Israeli government at least who've articulated [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=661.26s)]
*  Clearly what their objectives are are the far-right? That's true [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=664.54s)]
*  You know, their objective is to displace everybody out of Gaza and to take the land [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=667.78s)]
*  Then you know is not what does it mean to defeat Hamas? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=673.0600000000001s)]
*  Like what is it? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=675.3s)]
*  How are they gonna govern this space who's gonna govern this space for how long like none of that is [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=676.42s)]
*  is clear at all and it feels like they're making this up as they go along while killing enormous amounts of people and [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=681.54s)]
*  You know fueling all this regional escalation and kind of changing the world's view of Israel [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=687.4599999999999s)]
*  This is not worth it. Yeah, and there's also been reports of continued attacks on hospitals and medical infrastructure [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=693.9399999999999s)]
*  I mean that the latest casual lesson casualty estimates are over 25,000 Palestinians dead [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=699.14s)]
*  63,000 wounded and [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=705.14s)]
*  219 IDF soldiers have been killed in combat since the offensive started in October including 21 soldiers in an incident on Monday [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=706.98s)]
*  I think it was a controlled detonation was they're trying to execute it and someone fired an RPG which [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=714.38s)]
*  Detonated earlier with all these soldiers in this building and a collapse on them horrible thing [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=719.74s)]
*  but you're right though Netanyahu saying things like [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=723.94s)]
*  We will not settle for anything short of an absolute victory. What does that mean though? What is victory? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=726.1800000000001s)]
*  This is like when George Bush used to say this like what is the absolute victory just rhetoric [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=730.5s)]
*  There was this mini deal broker by France and Qatar to deliver medicine to hostages and in some humanitarian aid for Gazans [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=734.34s)]
*  Unclear how effective that was if the medicine got to these people [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=741.3000000000001s)]
*  But I don't know I saw then it gave me a little bit of hope that it meant there were more negotiations going on [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=744.1s)]
*  But we'll we'll see and just like on the victory point you cannot [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=748.38s)]
*  if you're fighting a nation state, right like [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=753.86s)]
*  Israel in its wars that it did win victories right in 1967 [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=757.0600000000001s)]
*  You know [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=761.22s)]
*  1973 like if you're you're fighting like a nation state that you defeat on the battlefield and then they surrender [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=762.62s)]
*  Nobody's going to surrender, you know, like Hamas is not gonna come out and be like, okay, you defeated us [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=770.0600000000001s)]
*  No, we surrender and and you're not gonna eradicate every single member of Hamas. You're [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=774.74s)]
*  in the Palestinian people [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=780.38s)]
*  They're not gonna surrender there they don't want to leave Gaza so this talk talk like it's always dangerous to me when politicians [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=782.54s)]
*  Articulate these objectives that are meant to kind of mobilize the public behind a war [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=791.5s)]
*  But they don't lead to anything that you can actually define, you know [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=797.86s)]
*  I like what does it mean to militarily defeat Hamas at what point? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=801.62s)]
*  Will they say that that's been accomplished? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=806.42s)]
*  Because it's not gonna happen, you know in the sense that nobody's gonna give them the Hamas is not gonna say okay [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=809.9s)]
*  you won the war, you know, so [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=816.26s)]
*  Again, this is the problem with how they've done this whole thing, which is lashing out [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=818.78s)]
*  Understandably being a completely outraged at the heart of October 7th [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=824.74s)]
*  But then kind of not being clear in like targeted in their objectives [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=829.1s)]
*  And now we're at a point where? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=834.1s)]
*  Nobody kind of sees where this thing is going and the best thing is to just have a ceasefire and you know [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=836.3000000000001s)]
*  They may be putting this two-month thing on the table because they have to figure it out themselves. Yeah, what's your point? I mean Hamas? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=843.4s)]
*  Arose as a resistance movement to the occupation and you cannot defeat an idea [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=849.7s)]
*  It will always exist as long as there is an occupation in the West Bank [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=854.14s)]
*  And if you destroy all these schools in Gaza, like what are those kids who's gonna you know? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=856.82s)]
*  and there's all this these reports today about the mistreatment of [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=861.5400000000001s)]
*  People arrested and interrogated and detainees. I mean, it's like a lot of radicalization is happening [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=865.4200000000001s)]
*  It's also becoming very clear that the US and Israel just completely disagree on what to do after the fighting stops like to your point [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=870.86s)]
*  earlier [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=876.86s)]
*  last week and it Yahoo [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=877.9000000000001s)]
*  Categorically rejected a two-state solution and the creation of a sovereign Palestinian state [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=879.6600000000001s)]
*  BB said Israel must quote have security control over the entire territory west of the Jordan River that collides with the idea of sovereignty [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=884.62s)]
*  What can we do he continued this truth? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=892.06s)]
*  I tell to our American friends and I put the brakes on the attempt to coerce us to a reality [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=894.5s)]
*  That would endanger the state of Israel. So not only there is Netanyahu rejecting the two-state solution [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=898.74s)]
*  He's again bragging that he's the only one preventing the Americans from forcing a Palestinian state on Israel [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=904.22s)]
*  But I mean again, this isn't just a problem for BB with the US [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=910.98s)]
*  Israel wants Arab countries to pay for reconstruction efforts in Gaza. They also want normalization agreements with Saudi Arabia [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=914.74s)]
*  Both of those things are contingent on the creation of a Palestinian state [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=922.02s)]
*  So again, like we'll get to this but none of this should be a surprise [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=927.1s)]
*  It's always been clear that Netanyahu opposed a Tuesday solution will go through some of those quotes in a second [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=930.62s)]
*  But then I mean it does seem like Netanyahu's comments [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=935.84s)]
*  Pissed off a lot of people in Washington. You saw five Democrats sign on to a bill that would conditionate Israel [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=940.34s)]
*  The do the bare minimum condition it on compliance with international law [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=946.22s)]
*  But it moves some people into a better place in the Democratic Party [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=949.56s)]
*  but [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=953.8399999999999s)]
*  Confusingly president Biden seems to be [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=956.3599999999999s)]
*  The one still convinced that there could be a two-state solution [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=959.1999999999999s)]
*  He said there are a number of types of two-state solutions [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=962.0799999999999s)]
*  There's a number of countries that are members of the UN that don't have their own militaries. So it's talking about like a [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=965.2399999999999s)]
*  State light like what did you make of that quote from Biden there? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=970.64s)]
*  But like what of what he's getting at in terms of how there might be hope still for a two-state solution [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=974.0799999999999s)]
*  Look, this is why the hug BB strategy thing never made any sense because this guy has no interest in a two-state solution [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=978.64s)]
*  that's like his purpose that's his like platform he ran on we've talked about that and [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=984.64s)]
*  You know in terms of what Biden may have been referencing there have been proposals in the past including, you know in the Obama years [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=990.4s)]
*  We're in these negotiations for like a demilitarized Palestinian state [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=996.84s)]
*  a Palestinian state that not only doesn't have military but for some period of time maybe the [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1002.0s)]
*  Israeli military saws like a security responsibility in the West Bank and which by the way is the hard pill for the Palestinians to swallow [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1007.6800000000001s)]
*  yeah, but it's still a Palestinian state and BB still opposes that and [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1014.48s)]
*  What bothers me about this increasingly is for we'll get into why nobody should be surprised about this in a second [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1018.9200000000001s)]
*  But what bothers me about this is this is a major issue now for American credibility around the world [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1024.8400000000001s)]
*  You know because when the US government is going out and saying well, you know, this has got to end in a [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1030.8s)]
*  Two-state solution and there's gonna be a Palestinian state and then the Israeli Prime Minister who were you know giving? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1036.74s)]
*  An open spigot of military support and diplomatic support to you. It's like no. No, they'll never be a Palestinian state [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1042.5s)]
*  What we our credibility takes a huge blow because people are like we're not we don't believe you like we [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1049.38s)]
*  Tony Blinken running to every capital in the Arab world trying to negotiate normalization agreements trying to get yeah [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1055.6200000000001s)]
*  Pride support for the for Gazans and they're all looking at him like he's crazy. Yeah, it's like yes [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1061.3799999999999s)]
*  There will be a two-state solution. They're like, of course there won't well then [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1067.26s)]
*  And they'll all say and the Europeans to like well, okay [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1069.98s)]
*  Well go talk to you know [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1074.0s)]
*  The Israelis who you're giving all this assistance to if you want there to be two solution with you don't to convince us [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1075.46s)]
*  You know [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1081.7s)]
*  Like everybody's for two-state solution in in in Europe and most of the Arab world and even countries haven't recognized Israel like Saudi Arabia [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1082.1399999999999s)]
*  Clearly are willing to do so if there's a two-state solution [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1089.06s)]
*  This is not just about like obviously what the Palestinian people deserve [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1092.06s)]
*  In terms of their own state and also frankly at what I think is gonna be better for Israel in the long run [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1097.26s)]
*  Like I better to have a Palestinian state as a part of a way to secure Israel than this kind of open-ended [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1103.1399999999999s)]
*  Conflict with your neighbors, but it also implicates American credibility [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1108.86s)]
*  We look ridiculous when we use these warmed-over talking points about a two-state solution [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1112.8999999999999s)]
*  While the person we're dealing with in Israel is like no that's never gonna happen and you can't even he's you know mocking us [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1117.96s)]
*  He doesn't care if like a few Democratic senators sign on he'd be more than willing to kind of wait out Joe Biden [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1124.8799999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump he's betting he's betting on Trump because Trump doesn't want to be a Palestinian state either [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1131.96s)]
*  Do you think Donald Trump's gonna work for a Palestinian state? No, and so BB's play is clear [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1136.08s)]
*  It's like continue this war because that's the only way he can stay in power and stay out of prison [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1140.24s)]
*  So that the guy Donald Trump who's just like him, you know Donald Trump like BB needs to be in power to not be in prison [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1145.64s)]
*  You know, that's who he wants to win. So why why would we help this guy a different Israeli government? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1152.16s)]
*  Which is what's gonna happen on the back end of this war is better for everything [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1157.8s)]
*  including the prospect of [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1163.08s)]
*  resolving this issue and so we like [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1165.2s)]
*  Wanted to show that we're just not people with a vendetta against Netanyahu. So we look back at some little quotes in 1978 [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1167.84s)]
*  Netanyahu was asked if Palestinians had the right to a state. He said no [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1174.66s)]
*  I don't think they do it is unjust to demand the creation of a 22nd Arab state in the second [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1177.8600000000001s)]
*  Palestinian state at the expense of the only Jewish state. That's a pretty clear example [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1182.5800000000002s)]
*  Over time he got savvier politically and was less direct [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1187.26s)]
*  But again in 2000 he laid out his vision for the region in his book [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1191.38s)]
*  It talked about all of its real security requirements in the West Bank and said that is why when I'm asked whether I will support [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1195.78s)]
*  A Palestinian state I answer in the negative [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1201.5800000000002s)]
*  In 2009 he reversed his position and said he would support a Palestinian state then reversed it again [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1203.8999999999999s)]
*  By essentially saying over and over again that Palestinians can't be in charge of security. There was that [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1210.02s)]
*  Speech he delivered at the UN a couple years back where he held up a map [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1215.98s)]
*  that [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1221.34s)]
*  Showed all of the West Bank and Gaza as part of Israel. So Ben, I mean, I think what's frustrating about this is [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1222.5s)]
*  You know, yes, then yeah, who's most recent rejection of a two-state solution [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1228.6599999999999s)]
*  Got a lot of news and you know was seen by a lot of people in Washington [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1233.58s)]
*  But this is who he's always been and I don't know why people I guess it was just convenient for everyone to pretend otherwise [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1237.4199999999998s)]
*  Look the only time that he ever indicated any openness to a Palestinian state was in 2009 [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1244.1399999999999s)]
*  When Barack Obama had been elected and was at the height of his, you know global powers and [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1251.46s)]
*  And under a lot of pressure from the United States. I was there like he didn't want to say that like [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1258.22s)]
*  Pushed really hard by the United States and then he spent the next you know, however many years in two rounds of negotiations [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1263.3799999999999s)]
*  preventing and obstructing any movement towards the Palestinian state while expanding [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1270.54s)]
*  Israeli settlements deep into the West Bank in ways that were gonna make a Palestinian state impossible [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1276.58s)]
*  And then when he was facing a reelection threat in 2016 [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1280.4199999999998s)]
*  He said publicly in Israel and like some of you doesn't say these things in English [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1285.1799999999998s)]
*  That you should vote for him because he's the guy who's gonna not ever allow there to be a Palestinian state so long as [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1289.94s)]
*  He's prime minister like that's what he ran for in [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1295.06s)]
*  2016 he was on a platform saying vote for me because I'm the guy that will never allow there to be a Palestinian state now [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1298.02s)]
*  He's got an even more right-wing government. And yeah, he's holding up maps at the UN just you know weeks before [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1304.28s)]
*  Except October 7th that that don't have the West Bank and Gaza. They've Judean Samara [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1310.7s)]
*  That's the the terminology for greater Israel and so this this this idea in Washington the people are always like shocked shocked to find out [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1315.42s)]
*  Who baby? No, it was like we've been living with this guy and you make this point all time Tommy [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1323.46s)]
*  It's because nobody ever pushes him, you know, like the American media like treats him with kid gloves [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1327.5400000000002s)]
*  Oh, yeah, he goes around he says all the media by going to the US [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1332.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but whenever he opens his mouth in an election campaign in Israel or you know to his coalition [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1335.24s)]
*  It's always like I'm the guy that's gonna stop a Palestinian state. That's why you want me in charge [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1340.5800000000002s)]
*  I'm the guy that can be the frontman for this right-wing coalition because I know how to talk to the Americans [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1345.18s)]
*  This is who he is and what he's done his entire political career [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1349.38s)]
*  This is a guy who who rode a backlash to the Oslo Accords into his first round as prime minister, right? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1353.24s)]
*  This is a guy who is inciting [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1359.72s)]
*  opposition and violence [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1362.8600000000001s)]
*  Are arguably and you know can go back and check the you know, and people have had differing interpretations [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1364.42s)]
*  But at a minimum inciting [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1369.72s)]
*  Opposition to Oslo right around the time that you'd second being got assassinated [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1371.96s)]
*  I mean, so this is who he is [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1375.44s)]
*  You're not gonna get a Palestinian state as long as he's prime minister. That's like what he keeps telling us [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1377.24s)]
*  That's why if I were in the White House [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1381.52s)]
*  I would focus my attention on pushing them to get a ceasefire get the hostages back and then [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1383.0s)]
*  Figure out the rest with a new government. Yeah, exactly. This guy's not gonna do it for you [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1387.68s)]
*  The other major flare-up is over in Yemen and on Monday [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1391.24s)]
*  The US and the UK once again conducted airstrikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1395.6000000000001s)]
*  This time the targets were missile launchers air defense systems radars weapons storage areas was a pretty sizable strike [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1399.7s)]
*  This is the eighth round of airstrikes since January 11th [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1406.7s)]
*  President Biden was asked if the airstrikes were working to deter the Houthis. Here's his response [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1410.24s)]
*  Well, when you say working are they stopping the Houthis no, I'm they're gonna continue. Yes [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1417.7s)]
*  This is saying are they working? No, are they gonna kind of like [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1423.54s)]
*  Inadvertently the the perfect articulation of a lot of American farmhouse here right there. Is it working? No, but we'll keep doing it [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1427.48s)]
*  Not yeah, you can apply that to a lot of different things [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1433.6s)]
*  Vietnam. Yeah, yeah. Yeah [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1435.76s)]
*  The Washington Post reported the US is actually planning for a sustained military campaign against the Houthis [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1438.3999999999999s)]
*  This is a quote from that story [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1444.08s)]
*  Officials say they don't expect that the operation will stretch on for years like previous US wars in Iraq Afghanistan or Syria [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1446.36s)]
*  At the same time they acknowledge they can identify no end date or provide an estimate for when the Yemeni's military capability [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1452.56s)]
*  Will be adequately diminished. So [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1459.56s)]
*  Nerve-racking there then here's a clip from Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina saying who was asked if the US is at war with Yemen [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1462.96s)]
*  Hey Sabrina, is it now fair to say that the US is that war in Yemen? No, we don't seek war [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1469.16s)]
*  We don't think that we are at war [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1475.34s)]
*  We don't want to see a regional war just to follow up on a Dries's question [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1477.98s)]
*  I said that we are not at war with the Houthis, but if you know this tit-for-tat bombing [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1482.98s)]
*  We bombed them five times now. So if this isn't war you just explain that's a little a little bit more to us [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1489.8799999999999s)]
*  If this isn't war, what is war? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1495.4199999999998s)]
*  Sure, Laura [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1498.54s)]
*  Sure, uh great question. I just wasn't expecting it phrased exactly that way [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1500.3799999999999s)]
*  Look we are we do not seek war we are we do not we are not at war with the Houthis [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1505.48s)]
*  In terms of a definition, I think that would be more of a clear declaration [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1511.44s)]
*  from the United States, but again [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1516.0s)]
*  What we are doing and the actions that we are taking are defensive in nature. What you hear there is the challenge of being [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1518.92s)]
*  Can we just pour one out here because it's very easy [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1526.3600000000001s)]
*  We could we could try to poke fun at her but like we've been there where you have this approved guidance [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1529.4s)]
*  You know and you've been told you cannot say it's a war the lawyers won't allow you to say that [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1534.96s)]
*  Look, you know is and for good reason which is Congress hasn't asked [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1539.24s)]
*  Yeah, by the way, which will be yeah, we should talk about but like the people that write the guidance never to give [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1542.6000000000001s)]
*  Fuck yeah, they don't care. You know to some lawyers. I took a lot of shit for you. I remember well anyway [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1546.76s)]
*  Like I like one time I was told the same thing about Libya, you know, you can't say this you can't say this [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1551.8600000000001s)]
*  You know and sure enough like I didn't getting like mocked on the Daily Show and I was like [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1557.22s)]
*  Why don't you make fun of the people that handed me this yeah or the policy itself is kind of the point here [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1561.14s)]
*  So US troops are also, you know getting attacked by Iranian linked Shia groups in Iraq and Syria as we've talked about those attacks [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1566.22s)]
*  We're ongoing the US Navy has been working to try to intercept weapon shipments from Iran to the Houthis in Yemen [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1573.7800000000002s)]
*  Tragically to US Navy SEALs were lost at sea during one of those interdiction operations and are now presumed dead [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1580.5800000000002s)]
*  so then we talked earlier about the [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1586.1200000000001s)]
*  Hope that there might be some de-escalation in Gaza with this ceasefire agreement getting discussed, but the US [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1588.36s)]
*  Houthi escalation is getting worse every week. It seems [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1596.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and and again, I mean it's a smaller version of the same point I made about the Israeli military operation [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1600.04s)]
*  What is the objective here? What is the end game here? Because you're not gonna militarily defeat the Houthis [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1606.56s)]
*  They're not stopping their attacks on shipping [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1612.32s)]
*  So what how do you articulate what the goal is here and [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1615.28s)]
*  The couple pieces I'd focus on are number one again, like what is the legal basis for this? [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1619.72s)]
*  I mean again, you could mount a collective defense or a self defense because they've shot at [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1624.6799999999998s)]
*  US troops in the Red Sea, but Congress hasn't authorized anything, you know [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1629.8799999999999s)]
*  And if this is kind of this open-ended [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1634.4199999999998s)]
*  Military campaign like Congress has to get involved here. They have to get involved if I was in Congress [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1636.9399999999998s)]
*  You know [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1642.04s)]
*  There's such a thing as the War Powers act here and there has to be a process if they want to have an open-ended [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1642.6399999999999s)]
*  Military campaigning against Houthis there has to be a role for Congress. That's the first point [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1649.04s)]
*  Well, you because you have what is it 60 days 60 days [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1652.44s)]
*  Yeah, and the hostilities want to start under War Powers [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1655.04s)]
*  Yes, and and and then you need congressional approval after that, which is what makes some of these, you know [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1657.6s)]
*  The background quote I read from the post story so surprising like oh, it won't take years, but we can't tell you how long [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1663.04s)]
*  I mean, I would imagine you'd want to [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1668.48s)]
*  Constrain the duration at least in your public statements. Yeah. Yeah [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1670.64s)]
*  Well, and that leads me to my second point here, which is like how to add to what we've already said about this [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1674.8s)]
*  Like where is this all going? You know, like I think what part of what is so unsettling here in this [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1679.56s)]
*  I think that you know, we're being a little hard on [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1685.98s)]
*  the Biden administration, you know the last couple weeks, but I [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1689.24s)]
*  You know in this case look they didn't start all these things like, you know [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1692.88s)]
*  You know what? It's like to be in the White House and shit comes to you and you already have your plate full and then [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1697.1s)]
*  Suddenly like October 7th happens and then you got BB Netanyahu and then you've got the Houthis shooting him [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1701.54s)]
*  But right now we're at a position where if you're looking at this thing from the outside [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1706.1399999999999s)]
*  You see these horrific military operation in Gaza [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1709.78s)]
*  You see all this regional escalation and from Iraq to Syria and then you see this kind of new [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1713.46s)]
*  war military campaign or whatever we want to call it [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1719.78s)]
*  against the Houthis and [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1722.98s)]
*  Where it feels all very reactive, you know [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1725.3s)]
*  Where what is the vision here? Like where does this go? Like where is all this escalation channel? [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1728.98s)]
*  Like what is the strategy to deal with this multifaceted? [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1735.18s)]
*  war that's happening in the Middle East and [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1739.6200000000001s)]
*  I just feel like people are unsettled right now because [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1742.38s)]
*  We're you know, you never want to be in a position where you're so reactive and I've been there, you know [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1746.18s)]
*  And I've been part of administrations that were too reactive [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1751.5s)]
*  It's not new but like they're in they're in one of these moments where they're reacting and each of the individual decisions [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1754.34s)]
*  They make like they might make sense to them that they need to take these shots against the Houthis [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1760.78s)]
*  but when you stack this all up and you're kind of like are you responding to others or you kind of [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1764.7s)]
*  Implementing like a vision of what President Biden wants to do in this region because right now [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1770.9s)]
*  Like the Houthis you're responding to them [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1776.14s)]
*  They want you in this war like they want to be at the vanguard of the resistance the United States and Israel and you're [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1777.82s)]
*  Giving them that so so I just think there has to be like a step back and think this through never mind the politics in [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1782.18s)]
*  this country I just you know [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1788.98s)]
*  There's strategic and humanitarian reasons to not be doing this but like the politics in this country [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1790.8999999999999s)]
*  I like Americans are looking at this and thinking like really were more wars more like what's going on here? [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1795.46s)]
*  Yeah, and I think you know big big picture Biden would have told you he wanted to get out of military conflicts [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1800.62s)]
*  Middle East and pivot to Asia right I mean yeah, I was the Obama [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1806.02s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah easier said I've been there myself. Yeah easier said than done [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1809.98s)]
*  I mean also complicating things Iran fired a bunch of ballistic missiles and drones at targets in Syria Iraq and Pakistan [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1813.86s)]
*  they said that these targets were anti-iron terrorist groups and [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1820.3s)]
*  Israeli intelligence assets it's not at all clear that they hit anything besides [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1824.26s)]
*  you know some random businessmen's house or something in in the area, but [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1828.58s)]
*  Not helping things when you're firing well, and it's kind of like member ISIS launched that attack in Iran [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1833.92s)]
*  You know when this kind of fire starts to burn everybody's like alright [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1839.92s)]
*  You know like it suddenly like the norms you know it would have seen much more dramatic for Iran to fire a bunch of missiles [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1843.52s)]
*  Into Pakistan you know five months ago, but now it's kind of like well [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1849.3200000000002s)]
*  You know let's have at it you know party and that's kind of what worries me [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1853.0800000000002s)]
*  There's this dynamic in the region where is increasing it's kind of like okay like it's on and so you start just swinging at everybody [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1856.48s)]
*  You want to land a punch on yeah? [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1862.4s)]
*  Lastly I mean obviously most important of all is the impact on the many people who've dealt with nearly a decade of war [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1864.0800000000002s)]
*  Here's a clip from a woman named Bousha Abdul Kena about what it was like living in Yemen during nearly a decade of airstrikes [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1869.2800000000002s)]
*  Living in a country like Yemen with the fear of being pumped for eight years or four was [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1876.44s)]
*  Undescribable remembering how people were dying every day and how the ambulances [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1883.3600000000001s)]
*  All the time are non-stop, and you know that there are dead people on dead children and women are coming in these ambulances [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1889.5600000000002s)]
*  It's really terrifying there was no safe place in Yemen in the past and [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1896.72s)]
*  We don't know everybody is so terrified and so worried to have the same [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1902.8400000000001s)]
*  events and the same scenario happening of [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1909.3200000000002s)]
*  watching people dying every day and in front of us and [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1912.28s)]
*  Of course that it's not a feeling that I wish everybody would try to know to or understand how it feels to be in such [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1915.8400000000001s)]
*  situation of [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1923.24s)]
*  Not knowing where to go where you know that you're you're not safe, and there's no other place [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1925.32s)]
*  Which is safe in in the country. Just a reminder. This is a country where hundreds of thousands of people died in this most recent conflict [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1930.76s)]
*  People didn't have access to food or water or fuel or any sort of medical infrastructure [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1938.68s)]
*  There's just recently you know got this ceasefire agreement and ended the Saudi led coalition's bombing campaign in Yemen [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1943.76s)]
*  And this what's happening now with the Houthis is putting all that at risk [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1951.6399999999999s)]
*  And so people who suffered an awful lot you know yeah, you know I think it's worth like pausing on the fact that [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1956.08s)]
*  There's very few [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1963.3999999999999s)]
*  populations in the whole world [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1966.12s)]
*  That have suffered more [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1968.12s)]
*  Profoundly already than the people of Gaza and the people of Yemen you know and these are vulnerable people [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1970.36s)]
*  They they're not fighting back. They're not like in you know they're not like a they're just suffering in these wars and [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1976.8s)]
*  That's [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1985.08s)]
*  You want that to end you know I mean like this is not and it's an indictment really of a [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1987.0s)]
*  Certain kind of order in that region that the u.s. Is a big part of right and again [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1993.52s)]
*  I was in an administration that [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=1999.48s)]
*  You know was a part of [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2001.52s)]
*  Part of that I you know I think it was a huge mistake for the u.s. To support the Saudis going Yemen [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2004.32s)]
*  But it's a u.s.. And then the kind of all these autocrats you know [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2008.76s)]
*  nobody's values that [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2013.48s)]
*  perspective you know like [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2015.92s)]
*  it's always some game you know with a free flow of commerce through the Red Sea or the you know [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2018.72s)]
*  some proxy wars between the Gulf and Iran or [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2025.0s)]
*  Or you know the some Israeli conception of total absolute security that denies Palestinians rights or some fucking [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2028.76s)]
*  Hamas terrorist ideology like who is [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2036.28s)]
*  Speaking for the voice. We just heard like who is representing that view because it's just absent [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2040.6399999999999s)]
*  And and I hope there's some way to move towards at least [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2047.12s)]
*  a [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2052.0s)]
*  Listening to these people that continue to suffer in this endless cycle of conflict and also by the way doesn't solve all these other problems either [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2053.52s)]
*  Yeah [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2060.2s)]
*  Unfortunately, that was a pretty good set up to the next topic which is Sudan yeah where for similar reasons there has been this you know brutal [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2061.48s)]
*  Civil war going since last spring the fighting in Sudan is between the Sudanese Armed Forces and a paramilitary group called the RSF [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2069.44s)]
*  the [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2076.2799999999997s)]
*  Fighting in April started in Khartoum the capital but has since spilled out into all other parts of the country and has had devastating [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2077.24s)]
*  Consequences already so the reports are at least 12,000 people are dead over 7 million people have been displaced [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2083.4399999999996s)]
*  All Arabia had a report on how farmers have been unable to sell crops [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2089.4799999999996s)]
*  They've harvested or plant new crops which means there could be a famine if they don't figure out how to you know [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2093.3599999999997s)]
*  Get the food in the ground soon [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2099.4399999999996s)]
*  So the RSF the paramilitary force is currently winning the war and weapons shipments from the UAE [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2100.8399999999997s)]
*  The United Arab Emirates is why they are winning so the New York Times got their hands on an unpublished UN report that says [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2106.92s)]
*  Quote this new RSF firepower had a massive impact on the balance of forces both in Darfur and other regions of Sudan [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2112.64s)]
*  The US has been accusing the RSF of war crimes crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2120.0s)]
*  Apparently the Vice President Harris raised this weapons shipment issue with the UAE directly at the most recent climate change summit [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2125.92s)]
*  But in December and January [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2133.64s)]
*  This guy Khamiti who was the guy running the RSF. He was running around Africa. He real creepy [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2136.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, he was like the capitals of Kenya, South Africa, Rwanda [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2141.2799999999997s)]
*  He was met by heads of state and so he's not only winning this war [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2144.66s)]
*  But I think he's sort of being greeted as he's you know, the de facto leader of Sudan now [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2149.52s)]
*  Here's the clip from a guy named David Shin who is the former US deputy chief of mission in Sudan talking about the crisis [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2154.52s)]
*  There needs to be an effort by the international community more generally [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2160.2999999999997s)]
*  To try to convince parties like the United Arab Emirates to stop [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2164.64s)]
*  providing the delivery of arms to the rapid support forces [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2171.4399999999996s)]
*  I'm sure that effort has been made but it obviously has not resulted in any success so far [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2175.3599999999997s)]
*  These countries have to ask themselves. What are they gaining out of this? [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2182.6s)]
*  So what by destroying Sudan, which is exactly what's happening? How do they gain from this? [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2186.52s)]
*  That's your point earlier Ben [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2193.4s)]
*  I mean this what's happening in Sudan is directly connected to Yemen because back in 2016 [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2194.52s)]
*  The UAE hired Khamiti and the RSF to fight for them against the Houthis in Yemen. So [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2199.1800000000003s)]
*  One thing I mean two things but so I think everyone should just remember that the original Abraham Abraham Accord agreement [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2205.84s)]
*  That Trump administration cut with the UAE was basically a massive arms sale deal [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2212.36s)]
*  I'd love to know if any of those US weapons are being used by the RSF now [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2216.96s)]
*  Good question and then too [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2221.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean any thoughts from you on what the US can or should be doing to pressure the UAE to stop these arm shipments? [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2222.66s)]
*  I mean the VP raising it is a big deal. I think Jake [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2228.9399999999996s)]
*  Sullivan the National Security Advisor raised it Tony Blinken has raised it. I don't know that we've heard anything about Biden calling the UAE [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2232.1s)]
*  maybe all the DC glitterati could raise it with the [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2238.66s)]
*  UAE's ambassador to the US at one of his fancy parties in Washington. Yeah, Cafe Milano [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2243.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean that's the point is it like the UAE is like very plugged into the you know [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2248.46s)]
*  The West and the US and the mass amounts of arm sales hosting international summits including climate change, you know [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2253.6600000000003s)]
*  Oh manner of business. It's not like there's an absence of leverage or connectivity, right? [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2259.5800000000004s)]
*  It's not unlike, you know, we're talking about Israel, you know [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2264.94s)]
*  If the UAE doesn't feel like its interests are going to be [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2269.6600000000003s)]
*  implicated or [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2274.42s)]
*  worsened [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2276.54s)]
*  By its continued support to the RSF it will continue to support the RSF and if you're just raising a diplomatic [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2277.7s)]
*  Hey, we'd like you to not do this [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2282.9s)]
*  They they will just tune that out, you know [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2284.94s)]
*  And look the root of all this to people should remember there was a democratic uprising against the genocidal [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2287.18s)]
*  dictator of Sudan Bashir a few years ago and then the Sudanese military kind of backed by [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2293.7s)]
*  The Saudis and the Emiratis were like, oh, we don't like popular uprising [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2300.7s)]
*  We're gonna kind of scrap the transition to democracy stuff and then it becomes kind of like a Game of Thrones because you know [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2304.88s)]
*  It's like okay [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2311.92s)]
*  Whoever is gonna have the strongest militia wins and the UAE bets on one and some other people bet on some other guys [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2312.98s)]
*  and that's how you get these scenarios and until unless and until we're breaking the cycle of this complete tolerance of [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2317.0s)]
*  this manner of [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2324.6s)]
*  geopolitics like this is gonna keep happening and again this put the Sudanese in the bucket with the Yemenis and [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2326.88s)]
*  The people of Gaza like these are people that they don't have power and so they're just on the wrong end of this [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2332.12s)]
*  Yeah, I should say the UAE denies shipping these weapons to the RSF [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2338.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't believe them but they deny it the BBC also had a report about the UAE [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2343.36s)]
*  funding political assassinations in Yemen [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2348.7599999999998s)]
*  Specifically hiring a former US Navy SEAL that the BBC interviewed to talk about [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2351.96s)]
*  You know who they were have they this process worked and the kinds of people they were taking out [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2356.1s)]
*  It wasn't like terrorist leaders. It was yeah, you know people in politics [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2360.32s)]
*  The Biden administration has apparently named Tom Perriello to be the special envoy to Sudan [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2365.2400000000002s)]
*  I think that nomination has been delayed by some bureaucracy, but that would be a good great guy great guy [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2370.56s)]
*  And I can you know look even if you're not gonna fix the structure of autocracy [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2376.2200000000003s)]
*  At a minimum, can you try to channel the UAE does have a lot of resources, right? [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2380.92s)]
*  And can they kind of channel this influence into like some process that brings in other countries in the region? [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2384.48s)]
*  To just try to stop the fighting have ceasefires get humanitarian aid in so again, like I the world is what it is [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2390.32s)]
*  You know the UAE's, you know not gonna necessarily change [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2396.82s)]
*  But like you could at least with a Tom Perriello try to channel this into something that is less violent [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2399.7200000000003s)]
*  You know that alone would make things better and better as our old boss used to say better is good [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2405.28s)]
*  Yeah, some intensive diplomacy would help [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2410.0s)]
*  then let's turn to Europe because over the weekend people across Germany took to the streets to protest the far-right alternative for Germany party or [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2412.04s)]
*  so in Berlin [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2420.76s)]
*  Police figure said a hundred thousand people were on the lawn of the Reichstag in Munich and Hamburg [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2422.88s)]
*  There were rallies where they had to send people away because too many showed up and they just couldn't fit them all [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2427.92s)]
*  Some estimates say hundreds of thousands of people took part in the demonstrations [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2433.88s)]
*  The organizers said the number was over 1.4 million. So a ton of people were out over the weekend protesting the AFD [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2437.28s)]
*  The AFDs popularity has been surging recently [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2444.36s)]
*  There are polls showing them doing better than the centrist and center-left parties [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2447.16s)]
*  The protests were specifically in response to a report that last November two AFD members attended a meeting with other right-wing figures where the [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2451.64s)]
*  assembled group of neo-nazi types [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2459.44s)]
*  Discussed a plan to deport millions of immigrants and refugees including some who have German citizenship [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2462.3399999999997s)]
*  The Associated Press described the large turnout as you know [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2468.3599999999997s)]
*  This important inflection point for Germans galvanizing around opposition to the AFD in this new and meaningful way and really hitting the streets and taking action [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2471.86s)]
*  And these protests come just months before they are going to be these regional elections in eastern Germany [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2479.78s)]
*  Where the AFD is doing the strongest so we're doing the best [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2485.2400000000002s)]
*  So, you know you and I've talked a bunch of times about the rise of far-right parties in Europe our anxiety about [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2489.1s)]
*  Them in Germany in particular did these protests make you feel any less anxious about that? [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2496.58s)]
*  Look like the you know when I'm looking for hope out in the world [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2502.02s)]
*  I mean like the it's like anything in life like the first step is realizing you have a problem, you know [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2505.22s)]
*  it's always good when people demonstrate an awareness that they see what's happening and they see the stakes and so [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2509.46s)]
*  300,000 people is not going to reverse the politics [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2516.18s)]
*  But it does show that people are paying attention and that they know that we're entering into already living through a very high stakes political [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2518.66s)]
*  moment [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2524.86s)]
*  That is very good and then it's expression of kind of a values proposition to counter what's coming from the FD [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2525.5s)]
*  I also think that then that has to be channeled into [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2531.92s)]
*  Like some approached immigration in Europe as in this country, right that balances [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2535.3s)]
*  Okay on the one hand like yeah [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2539.4s)]
*  You need to kind of make people feel like there's an immigration system that is working that is controlled [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2541.28s)]
*  You know, but at the same time [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2546.76s)]
*  You need to call out, you know [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2550.3s)]
*  There's misinformation from the FD for instance as with the Republican Party in this country [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2552.02s)]
*  There's a lot of misinformation about like crime, you know being like through the roof because of these immigrants when there's just not dated to support that [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2555.62s)]
*  You know, it's also the case that there's a lot of benefits, you know [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2563.1s)]
*  Europe has an aging population like a young immigrant workforce, you know, it can be a good thing [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2566.82s)]
*  There's a values proposition that Angela Merkel made that Germany has a special responsibility when it comes to refugees [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2572.14s)]
*  Which is one of the reasons why they took in so many so like again [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2577.58s)]
*  You need you know [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2580.84s)]
*  You need to kind of obviously meet people where they are and if people are concerned about immigration you have to have that conversation and [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2582.84s)]
*  But at the same time bringing some values into the conversation is important [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2588.88s)]
*  And that's what you kind of saw there [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2592.76s)]
*  Even if even if the bunch of those people made want to restrict immigration fine [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2593.84s)]
*  But like let's have a conversation about the humane way to do that deporting. Everybody's not that you know, there are other ways [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2597.2000000000003s)]
*  Of addressing it. No, it's interesting in Germany [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2604.0800000000004s)]
*  In Germany we're talking about the AFD the far-right party trying to use immigration to win power in the UK [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2606.56s)]
*  You're seeing the conservatives try to manage an immigration problem to I don't know stay in power or at least lessen their defeat [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2613.16s)]
*  Because you got Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and the Tory parties [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2620.6s)]
*  They're still desperately trying to implement this plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2624.14s)]
*  So this was a policy or at least an idea that dates back to 2022 [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2627.52s)]
*  The idea was let's deter immigration by sending asylum seekers who arrive in the UK to Rwanda and then force them to have their [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2632.3s)]
*  Asylum cases heard there and if asylum is granted resettle them in Rwanda instead of the UK now this idea is [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2639.6200000000003s)]
*  It's idiotic on its face. Like why would you send someone from Afghanistan to Rwanda? It's insane [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2646.2200000000003s)]
*  And it was quickly met with you know, legal challenges and other protests [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2651.82s)]
*  The UK Supreme Court ultimately decided it was unlawful because Rwanda was unsafe and they detailed all the ways that Rwanda's judicial system [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2656.9399999999996s)]
*  Which is not set up to properly adjudicate these cases [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2664.1s)]
*  And the outcomes could lead to people with legitimate asylum cases [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2667.3399999999997s)]
*  Being sent back to their home countries and maybe tortured or mistreated in some way [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2671.66s)]
*  So what Sunak then did is not listen to the courts [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2675.3799999999997s)]
*  But he tried to negotiate a new treaty with Rwanda to improve the judicial system or at least get them to agree to and then he asked [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2679.14s)]
*  Parliament to pass a bill that basically is the equivalent of saying actually Rwanda is safe just sort of stating it as a fact [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2686.32s)]
*  That plan hit a little road bump on Monday when the House of Lords told him to pump the brakes and delayed passage of the bill [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2694.1200000000003s)]
*  So to sum it up then the UK has already paid Rwanda over 300 million dollars to implement this plan [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2701.44s)]
*  But no deportations have taken place yet [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2707.76s)]
*  Sunak promised to stop the boats. I was one of his five promises in his campaign manifesto [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2711.32s)]
*  This means that in this case migrants crossing the English Channel from France would be stopped [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2716.6000000000004s)]
*  The Home Office says that nearly 30,000 people were detected crossing the English Channel in 2023 [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2722.28s)]
*  so he's failed at one of his five promises and [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2727.98s)]
*  on top of it all the far-right wing of the Tory party hates his plan and [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2730.8s)]
*  Attacks it as weak and attacks Sunak for not implementing it. So this is not going well for him either [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2735.6000000000004s)]
*  yeah, but this is also like Ron DeSantis level bullshit because [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2741.36s)]
*  Here's what I mean, I actually got pretty interested in this [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2745.6s)]
*  The reality what's happening is there's a significant uptick in terms of legal immigration into the United Kingdom [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2748.48s)]
*  That is far beyond the people across small boats [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2754.48s)]
*  Yeah, and what it is is they the NHS the National Health Service cannot function without immigrant workers. Yeah, right [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2758.7599999999998s)]
*  Care the whole care worker industry in the UK is dependent on [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2765.3999999999996s)]
*  immigrant workers, right? [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2769.7599999999998s)]
*  So people who want someone to look after their elderly parent like, you know [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2770.76s)]
*  They may be anti immigration when it comes to you know, stop the boats [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2773.76s)]
*  But then they want somebody who can work in the care industry [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2776.88s)]
*  The UK higher education system relies on a lot of foreign students [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2781.0800000000004s)]
*  And they have a rule that if you are a foreign student, you know [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2784.88s)]
*  Your family can come with you and a lot of these by the way are like rich people coming to nice UK universities [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2788.44s)]
*  So at the same time that they're all posturing and doing Rwanda deals just to show how tough they are [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2792.4s)]
*  They actually are because they've so fucked the NHS with their austerity programs [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2798.3599999999997s)]
*  Like they need like a labor source and because of fucking brexit [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2803.56s)]
*  That's hard for them to get so so this is the the Tories being like, you know [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2807.9599999999996s)]
*  This is the rotten corrupt end of the Tories and that because of their austerity and brexit programs [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2812.12s)]
*  They're not you know [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2817.9199999999996s)]

*  To keep the economy going so they're gonna posture around this Rwanda thing when like you said like nobody's even going they're fighting this huge [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2823.68s)]
*  Political battle over something that doesn't work. I mean kind of credit to the Rwandans for pocketing 300 million pounds or whatever it is [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2830.64s)]
*  Yeah, like because this is all fucking bullshit [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2837.68s)]
*  Is it Rishi Sunak posturing for a bunch of people because he's afraid of the right wing is party just like the Republicans here [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2839.68s)]
*  Yeah [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2844.2s)]
*  And they're not gonna win overall like the UKIP far-right people that know how to neutralize those people want to see you like [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2844.48s)]
*  The Royal Navy and like fucking Dunkirk and the English channel like fighting boats with asylum seekers on and they're not gonna do that [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2849.84s)]

*  Staying in Europe and switching gears here Ben Elon Musk's anti-semitism apology tour continues [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2858.88s)]
*  He's in Poland at the moment for a symposium on anti-semitism [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2864.32s)]
*  Earlier in the trip he and Ben Shapiro toward Auschwitz the infamous concentration camp [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2869.0s)]
*  This comes after Musk's trip to Israel last year where he and Bibi Nanyahu toward a kibbutz that have been attacked by Hamas on October 7th [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2873.9199999999996s)]
*  This all stems from an incident last year folks might remember where Elon replied to someone who posted an anti-semitic [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2882.6s)]
*  conspiracy theory saying quote you have said the actual truth [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2889.48s)]
*  No, they had not very bad thing to say [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2893.7599999999998s)]
*  Here's a clip of Elon talking about anti-semitism from his visit to Poland in the circles that I move [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2895.8799999999997s)]
*  I see almost no anti-semitism [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2901.3999999999996s)]
*  anti-semitism [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2904.0s)]
*  And you know, there's this old joke. I've got like this one Jewish friend. No, I have like two-thirds of my friends are Jewish [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2905.0s)]
*  Twice as many Jewish friends as non-jewish friends. I'm like Jewish by association [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2913.0s)]
*  I'm aspirationally Jewish as a member of the tribe. Did that work for you? [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2916.7599999999998s)]
*  Every time this guy opens his mouth [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2921.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean first of all does anybody doubt that the Elon Musk who tweeted like you spoke the actual truth is not there really on [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2922.9199999999996s)]
*  Of course, of course, that's what he thinks right like it's obvious and like going to Auschwitz Ben Shapiro doesn't like, you know [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2929.08s)]
*  Change that reality and by the way if you went and spoke, you know [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2935.68s)]
*  With with something that sounded like genuine evolution [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2940.08s)]
*  Because I believe people can change you or we have to at least hold open that belief or else like what's the point of all? [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2943.68s)]
*  Of it, but like that's it didn't sound like a guy who's like really wrestling, you know [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2947.96s)]
*  Who's saying like, you know what like I had these views and I like now I've been forced to reckon with them [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2952.64s)]
*  That's a guy like [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2957.32s)]
*  engaging in tropes like, you know, I've got I've got more Jewish friends than anybody so I'm not any like this is [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2958.92s)]
*  We so much easier to kick the Nazis off Twitter, man. He's just like pissing on our leg [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2965.0400000000004s)]
*  Yeah, like take the Nazis off Twitter and then maybe have a conversation [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2968.6400000000003s)]
*  Like you said actions speak a lot of the more so forget his tweet like the fact that you invite all the Nazis back to Twitter [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2972.28s)]
*  Like there's not no content moderation of that kind of garbage, you know [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2976.96s)]
*  Just cuz like and you know Ben Shapiro [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2980.52s)]
*  These are two people with mutual interest like Ben Shapiro once like, you know X to turbocharge his platforms and Elon can you know [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2983.76s)]
*  Hide behind Ben Shapiro and say I have a lot of Jewish friends like this is bullshit [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2991.76s)]
*  We all know it [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=2995.2000000000003s)]

*  Acknowledgement that Elon Musk has benefited from climate investing by the government more than almost anyone else [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3009.64s)]
*  But a story from their day finally Ben if you guys need an idea for what to get a loved one for Valentine's Day [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3014.52s)]
*  We have you covered [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3022.12s)]
*  Winston Churchill's teeth are for sale for just ten thousand dollars [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3023.9199999999996s)]
*  You could be the proud owner of Churchill's upper dentures [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3027.54s)]
*  Which apparently were specifically constructed to maintain his natural lisp were mounted on gold [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3029.96s)]
*  The director of the auction house this woman named Liz Pohl said this set was probably made at the start of World War two [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3035.64s)]
*  It must be among the most unusual items we've ever sold. Yeah, I hope so speaking of Churchill DeSantis [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3041.2799999999997s)]
*  You should I swear you saw this too Ben [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3047.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3049.8799999999997s)]
*  fake quote DeSantis announced the end of his 2024 presidential campaign with a video where he attributed a [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3050.16s)]
*  quote to Prime Minister Churchill [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3057.08s)]
*  He said quote success is not final failure is not fatal it is the courage to continue that counts [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3060.22s)]
*  Churchill never said that so now there's one of those fun little community notes things under the Santas is pathetic little dropout video [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3067.22s)]
*  Saying it never appeared in any article speeches or books by Winston Churchill [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3074.46s)]
*  I mean, maybe there's any money left in the like never back down [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3078.04s)]
*  Super PAC fund that was drained with private jets and you know [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3083.02s)]
*  Consultant fees they can scrounge up $10,000 [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3087.58s)]
*  Maybe Ron DeSantis could buy the dentures and pop them in and look in the mirror and read himself [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3090.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's a good idea. See someone with some balls. Yeah [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3097.4599999999996s)]
*  That would be a better way to spend money then I think there's some [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3101.22s)]
*  Someone did it like it was like four grand five grand a vote [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3104.74s)]
*  Something like that when you total up is spending the number of votes you got get some dentures out of it [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3107.8599999999997s)]
*  Not not not great. Okay, we're gonna take a quick break and we come back [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3111.56s)]
*  Here Ben's conversation about what the hell is going on in Ecuador and what we can do about it [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3114.86s)]
*  So stick around for that last week. We talked a bit about the really intense situation in Ecuador [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3119.38s)]
*  We wanted to go a bit more on in depth on how we got here [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3125.5s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3130.6200000000003s)]
*  What potential solutions could look like the president there? [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3132.26s)]
*  President Bo has declared a state of emergency as he's dealing with [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3136.1000000000004s)]
*  Enormous gang and drug violence, which has reached a real fever pitch this month with prisons overrun hostages taken [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3140.1s)]
*  kidnappings [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3147.86s)]
*  terrible public spectacles attack on a public [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3149.46s)]
*  An attack on a television station where journals were held at gunpoint. It's a lot going on [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3152.58s)]
*  To unpack all of that with us is my very good friend and full disclosure [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3157.9s)]
*  former [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3163.5s)]
*  Negotiating partner in the normalization of relations with Cuba an all-around partner in crime [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3164.78s)]
*  Although I realized maybe I shouldn't say partner in crime because some people might take that literally [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3170.2400000000002s)]
*  But Ricardo Zuniga who is most recently the principal deputy assistant secretary of state [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3174.9s)]
*  For the Western Hemisphere at the State Department spent many years [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3180.7400000000002s)]
*  Working in Latin America. He is currently a senior advisor at the US Institute of Peace and a partner at Dinamica [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3184.5800000000004s)]
*  Americas Ricardo so good to see you man. Great to see you then. I think we're partnering crime is fine. Yeah [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3192.2599999999998s)]
*  so I [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3199.06s)]
*  Said huge mouthful there [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3200.66s)]
*  But I was thinking like who could help us get a bit of an explainer and some understanding of what's going on [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3202.74s)]
*  Given your depth. I mean people should know you're the lead staff at the White House on Latin America [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3209.66s)]
*  You know lead at the State Department on these issues [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3213.8599999999997s)]
*  What is going on [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3219.06s)]
*  Can you can you explain? [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3221.06s)]
*  Why this is happening in Ecuador why it's happening now and you know [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3223.46s)]
*  What the kind of structural reasons are that might be causing all this chaos? [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3228.7799999999997s)]
*  But that's a really great point [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3232.7s)]
*  This didn't just come from nowhere and it's really important to understand what's happening in Ecuador [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3234.5s)]
*  Because there are lots of other parts of Latin America that are vulnerable to this kind of violence [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3239.38s)]
*  So it's not just happening there, but I'd say there's really four important things [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3244.5s)]
*  That led to what we're seeing now that kind of the level of intense level of violence that we're seeing now in Ecuador [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3249.18s)]
*  And the first is geography [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3255.5s)]
*  Ecuador is a perfect launch point for mass shipments of cocaine [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3257.58s)]
*  Especially to Europe and Asia which are the the burgeoning markets [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3262.06s)]
*  Right now it sits between Colombia and Peru two of the three largest producers of coke in the world [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3265.98s)]
*  And it has an excellent port in Guayaquil. So it was perfectly situated [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3271.8199999999997s)]
*  That's the first so the first is geography second is regional politics and this might be something that feels like a [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3278.3s)]
*  You know, it wouldn't be logical but the fact is the peace process in Colombia played a role here too because the FARC [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3286.26s)]
*  combatants the guerrilla force that [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3293.3s)]
*  Reached an accord with President Santos in Colombia during the Obama administration [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3297.34s)]
*  They controlled the drug flow in that part of the border [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3303.3399999999997s)]
*  They were part of that drug trade and when they demobilized they left a vacuum in that stretch of border [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3306.06s)]
*  Which meant that a lot of that cocaine flow then moved over to a kind of this [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3311.5s)]
*  This different set of gangs that had been there but hadn't had access to the cocaine market and they do now [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3315.42s)]
*  Third is criminal geopolitics and you have to think about this. There are geopolitics around crime as well and [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3321.58s)]
*  Criminal groups, especially Mexican cartels are at really at the peak of their power right now. They have access to [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3327.9s)]
*  Finance like they've never had revenue weapons and a level of sophistication [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3336.58s)]
*  And global networks that we haven't seen before [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3341.1800000000003s)]
*  They were ready to service that spike in European demand and all they needed were local partners and they found them in these gangs in Ecuador [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3344.6200000000003s)]
*  So some of the violence that we see in Ecuador is actually competition between competing cartels Mexican cartels [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3352.34s)]
*  Sinaloa and we're about handed us the own in particular [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3358.86s)]
*  So that's another piece and finally it's the breakdown of governance in Ecuador [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3361.34s)]
*  So local corruption had been an issue [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3365.86s)]
*  But when you introduce these huge sums of cash the fact that governance was already weak in some rural areas [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3367.6600000000003s)]
*  but also in urban areas [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3374.7000000000003s)]
*  You combine that with [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3377.46s)]
*  The frankly an increase in cash that was available to bribe local officials and that became a huge deal [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3379.82s)]
*  there's a courageous attorney general in [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3385.7s)]
*  Ecuador the first [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3388.9s)]
*  woman the first Afro-Ecuadoran to hold that role and she's [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3391.26s)]
*  Documented widespread corruption that helped kind of create the situation and finally I'd say I mean part of this too is prison recruitment [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3394.9s)]
*  Which something we see all over Latin America. All right, that's a lot [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3401.32s)]
*  you know, I guess before I'm gonna get to the the the you know, the [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3404.78s)]
*  Response from the Ecuadorian government and and its supporters including the US but but before we do that [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3409.46s)]
*  So we've seen this surge, you know, there was an election [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3414.7400000000002s)]
*  President of Canada was actually assassinated [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3420.26s)]
*  Late in that election just a few months ago and now we've seen with the new government in [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3423.18s)]
*  What seems like a pretty dramatic uptick in sensational violence and kind of flexing? [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3428.14s)]
*  These cartels and these gangs [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3434.54s)]
*  What do you what are they doing like you mentioned some of them this is them fighting each other but like what what is their [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3437.18s)]
*  Intent wire, you know [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3442.7s)]
*  When you see people seizing television stations, you think like oh is this a coup? [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3444.3s)]
*  But yeah, I don't think they're trying to take over the government. I mean, what why is this? Why are they doing this? [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3447.58s)]
*  well, the violence is the point and [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3452.14s)]
*  what when the president of declared a state of [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3454.5s)]
*  Internal conflict and he called them terrorists, you know, he's not right in the sense that [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3460.74s)]
*  The way that we classically think of terrorists having a political motive [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3465.7s)]
*  But the violence is the point just like it is for terrorists to show the authorities [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3469.2599999999998s)]
*  But just equally the civilian citizens in Ecuador that they have uncontested power [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3473.68s)]
*  And the whole point here is to cow the state and the population [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3480.22s)]
*  into acquiescing to their control and their power and so they borrowed lessons learned from [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3486.18s)]
*  Mexican organizations during the early 2000s and the in the early teens and we're seeing it then in different parts of the region even [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3492.7s)]
*  We're a good friend as ambassador in Chile Bernadette Meehan is a fantastic US ambassador in Chile [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3499.82s)]
*  They've seen a spike in violence brought in by drug related gangs [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3505.06s)]
*  where they're seeing the kinds of violence that they haven't seen before and [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3509.02s)]
*  Authorities and populations just are not used to it. The point is [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3513.62s)]
*  Show that they cannot be stopped [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3517.14s)]
*  So [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3519.42s)]
*  President Bo as you kind of alluded to right? He's a young guy [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3520.54s)]
*  I mean, I kind of feel bad for anybody who gets elected in this context and you know [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3523.7799999999997s)]
*  Obviously his own life, you know is somewhat on the line given the assassinations we've seen there [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3530.2599999999998s)]
*  You know thus far he's declared this state of emergency. He's called them terrorists [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3536.02s)]
*  He's you know using the military to try to crack down on them. I mean what? [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3539.58s)]
*  What what what are what are the options available to him? [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3543.14s)]
*  How do you evaluate his response to date and and what it's this balance between [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3546.38s)]
*  You obviously need to do something here [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3551.82s)]
*  But you know you look at El Salvador and you see the potential risk of you know [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3554.1000000000004s)]
*  Something you're like just basically arresting everybody [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3558.42s)]
*  Who's in military age male almost? [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3560.9s)]
*  I mean, how do you evaluate what he's done and what what the playbook is that he has to work with? [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3562.6200000000003s)]
*  Well, he's got a terrible playbook and he has done well with that with what he has but it is [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3566.98s)]
*  It's really insufficient to the problem again, I mean the scale here is [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3573.3399999999997s)]
*  Ecuador has local tools and some international assistance [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3580.7799999999997s)]
*  We can talk about a second to help deal with this [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3584.22s)]
*  But the fact is Ecuador is just part of this very of this massive international [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3587.06s)]
*  Really structure that exists to move [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3596.46s)]
*  Cocaine right now, which is it bad and historically high levels of production [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3600.62s)]
*  To markets that haven't existed at this scale in the past, especially Europe and just to give you an idea then [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3605.98s)]
*  A kilo of cocaine in the United States costs about twenty eight thousand dollars in Europe. It's forty thousand dollars [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3611.58s)]
*  It's it's easier to sneak into Europe right now even with the [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3617.18s)]
*  Having to transport it across the ocean than it is to get to the US border [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3622.94s)]
*  There's a lot of reasons why it makes a lot of sense and there's a lot of reasons why [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3627.5s)]
*  Organizations like the Mexican cartels that have revenue in the tens of billions [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3633.34s)]
*  Are able to carry this out. They have the revenue. They have the GP of states, right? [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3639.58s)]
*  So this is Ecuador against a global organization [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3643.66s)]
*  And so what they can do is I think you just saw the news Chris Dodd [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3646.86s)]
*  President Biden's senior advisor on the American side [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3651.66s)]
*  President Biden's senior advisor on the Americas was in Ecuador yesterday with general Richardson the command coming on the US southern command [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3654.62s)]
*  And they were there to provide an immediate signs. The idea here is to have visual support for the government of Ecuador [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3663.1s)]
*  But also to to start laying the groundwork for a greater level of cooperation [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3670.94s)]
*  Bulletproof vests the kind of support that the United States provides to police to give them better technology. That's all important [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3676.38s)]
*  But it's really about what Ecuador and Ecuador and institutions are able to do [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3682.78s)]
*  And this brings me to one other really important problem, which is he doesn't have the finance that he doesn't have the money [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3686.94s)]
*  To really combat this problem at scale. Yeah, I mean from what you're saying and having lived with some of this myself [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3693.42s)]
*  I mean like they have no capacity to deal with the scale this challenge by themselves. Um, I mean, that's just obvious [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3699.7400000000002s)]
*  So what what is what are the pieces of like a an international strategy? [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3706.1400000000003s)]
*  Recognizing it we're in a time when everybody's kind of distracted by one thing or another there's wars there's instability [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3711.42s)]
*  Politics are a mess in lots of places, but essentially just listening to you [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3717.8199999999997s)]
*  It's like well the u.s has a lot of capability obviously on the security side [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3721.5s)]
*  We have a demand issue ourselves with cocaine other drugs the europeans it seems like have some role to play here [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3724.94s)]
*  Which is unusual in latin america [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3730.8599999999997s)]
*  Because it's their demand and it's the poorest nature of their borders in some respect that is feeding this a bit [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3733.58s)]
*  And then I imagine also obviously the countries surrounding ecuador [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3739.7400000000002s)]
*  Some of which are cocaine producers have a role to play. I mean, what is [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3743.34s)]
*  What does a multilateral initiative look like that might not solve it but at least make it a little bit better? [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3746.38s)]
*  So I think what's really important here is to distinguish between the drug questions which are crucial obviously because this is the main product [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3751.42s)]
*  It's not the only product anymore that we're talking about people the movement of people [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3758.86s)]
*  Um the illicit movement of people in particular [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3763.6600000000003s)]
*  uh [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3766.28s)]
*  extortion [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3767.7400000000002s)]
*  and other criminal activities are financed from [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3769.5s)]
*  You know across borders [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3772.86s)]
*  The point is really about international cooperation to deal with these sophisticated organizations and attack them from different directions [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3774.6200000000003s)]
*  uh, it's it's less about and although it's important to [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3781.7400000000002s)]
*  Interdict drug shipments in the sense of just trying to deny them revenue. It's important to think of them as a as a criminal corporation [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3785.9s)]
*  and [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3793.34s)]
*  Starting to find ways to go after those pieces of it in different jurisdictions outside of ecuador is going to help the situation in ecuador [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3794.22s)]
*  So it's not about equipment as much as it is about international organization. Yes, multilateral development banks need to help ecuador at this critical moment [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3802.3799999999997s)]
*  Yes, europe needs to provide police and intelligence support [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3810.8599999999997s)]
*  Uh, and certainly work on the demand reduction side [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3814.4599999999996s)]
*  We do in the united states as well, but this is really about looking at these organizations in a different way [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3817.66s)]
*  Uh, and I say this is important because they could start affecting countries that we don't think of as danger spots like costa rica and brazil [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3823.7400000000002s)]
*  Because of the power that they have and because these same factors are at play and look [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3831.58s)]
*  We should be clear the u.s. Has a lot of skin in this game and not excluding the fact that um [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3836.2200000000003s)]
*  All this violence right is part of what is driving people to our border [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3842.62s)]
*  You are also the envoy for the northern triangle for central america trying to manage that [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3848.14s)]
*  um [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3852.7799999999997s)]
*  But I want to talk about mexico because that obviously is like a hub of this this uh cartel network [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3853.74s)]
*  um [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3859.42s)]
*  And you know you hear I think we're in here in the presidential campaign, you know this kind of normalization of [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3860.46s)]
*  Trump wanting to like, you know bomb mexico or go to war with mexico, which you know, probably not the right answer but but [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3866.2999999999997s)]
*  If I do look back [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3872.62s)]
*  You know before you know kind of leading into the obama years [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3874.3799999999997s)]
*  Uh under president calderon in mexico you had really like a war against the cartels [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3878.86s)]
*  Um a real effort to militarily defeat them that didn't work. Um, it led to a lot of loss of life and it didn't dislodge the cartels [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3884.3s)]
*  then you saw kind of like a [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3891.6600000000003s)]
*  while I was in government it was kind of this mix of different capabilities and [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3893.6600000000003s)]
*  You know, um under penya neto that the next mexican president [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3897.6600000000003s)]
*  Maybe sometimes dealing with the cartels maybe sometimes taking them on [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3901.98s)]
*  And now you've seen under omlo the current president mexico a bit more hands off, you know, uh with the cartels [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3905.9s)]
*  Point is it like none of that is working like like there's so you know to be somewhat sympathetic to the mexican government, you know [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3913.34s)]
*  They've tried all these different approaches. None of them work. I mean what what is available? [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3920.3s)]
*  What what would would you be telling the mexican government? [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3924.38s)]
*  If you know that they should be doing to try to get their arms around this [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3927.66s)]
*  Well, look they have the mexican government has one piece of this that's absolutely correct [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3931.3399999999997s)]
*  Which is part of this is cutting off the arms flow from the united states [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3935.58s)]
*  Uh, I mean, I think that most people most listeners may not realize how saturated latin america is with weapons [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3939.1s)]
*  purchased by [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3945.98s)]
*  criminal organizations in many cases, but not always [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3947.3399999999997s)]
*  that are that are in [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3950.46s)]
*  Everywhere from from brazil to mexico and the mexican government today started really pushing the united states on this issue [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3952.46s)]
*  It's one part of it [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3960.22s)]
*  But the real issue is that I think if if you were if I were to advise [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3961.66s)]
*  Any government at this point it would be to look at these organizations [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3967.26s)]
*  In a different way than than we have in the past. They are not about drugs. They are not just about moving people [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3972.06s)]
*  They're about making money [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3977.42s)]
*  And the one area where I think we probably haven't dedicated enough creativity is in [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3978.94s)]
*  finding basically [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3985.34s)]
*  Of [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3987.58s)]
*  You know, they are part of economies and finding ways to to block that and impede that and complicate that and raise the cost of business [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3988.6200000000003s)]
*  is as important as interdicting [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3996.2200000000003s)]
*  uh a a you know a drug shipment or [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=3998.7000000000003s)]
*  Uh, or a shipment of people is what they're also into these days [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4002.06s)]
*  uh, and so that's [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4006.3s)]
*  Really what they're about they'll adapt to anything. I mean in mexico, you know production of fentanyl and [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4008.6200000000003s)]
*  It has become much more important than the flow than the flow of cocaine to a market that's pretty stable [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4013.5s)]
*  Um, so they'll they'll adjust uh to that but they need to it's about dollars for them [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4018.7s)]
*  So it's really about imposing costs going after the money. Yeah [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4023.74s)]
*  um, and I also want to ask, you know, uh [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4026.8599999999997s)]
*  You know, we we obviously talk a lot on this podcast about you know, ukraine and gaza and the middle east and [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4030.14s)]
*  But you know, there's some kind of weird troubling signs in latin america. Um [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4037.66s)]
*  In the sense, you know, you've got you know, this kind of bukele model in el salvador someone kind of this kind of [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4042.54s)]
*  Non-ideological dictator model, right? Uh, i'm just going to be a strong man for the sake of being a strong man [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4049.1s)]
*  You've got this uptick in violence, uh, which again is contributing to [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4054.7s)]
*  Uh flow of people to our borders as you point out the same people politicians that [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4059.1s)]
*  You know cry about that are also obstructing gun laws that might [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4063.74s)]
*  Impede that violence, but we'll get that later. You know, you've got the predictable maduro, you know, uh [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4068.14s)]
*  Threatening to invade, you know guiana you've got now in argentina and the new president there kind of a weird libertarian ideologue [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4074.38s)]
*  You know threatening to dismantle his own government. I mean what the hell is going on? [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4082.78s)]
*  You know, like what what is how would you characterize the? [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4087.58s)]
*  The state of because and I say this with humility, right? [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4091.1800000000003s)]
*  Like if I was in latin america looking at the us i'd be like what the hell is going on with you guys, right? [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4094.2200000000003s)]
*  So this is not to criticize or single out but I mean [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4097.5s)]
*  What what worries you about the political trends and and are there positive ones that we're missing too? [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4101.42s)]
*  I mean, how does this fit into the context of what's happening in latin america? Generally, I think you nailed it [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4106.78s)]
*  Latin america is thoroughly part of the west it is [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4112.62s)]
*  It is absolutely part of the same crisis of the west the united states is experiencing which is to say that there's not a [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4115.74s)]
*  There's not an ideological challenge to you know democracy per se there's not a there's not a they [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4123.26s)]
*  As there was during the cold war there's not an organized entity with a competing ideology [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4130.22s)]
*  That's totalitarian or authoritarian in nature people prefer to live in democracy [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4134.86s)]
*  But they prefer to live in democracies that work that actually provide schools police [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4139.099999999999s)]
*  and [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4144.62s)]
*  And jobs and help kind of create there's in latin america much more than the united states. There is a role for the state [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4146.0599999999995s)]
*  Right to left there is belief that the state has a larger role than you know, we say we believe in the united states [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4152.62s)]
*  That's that's absolutely the case [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4157.74s)]
*  But almost everywhere you're seeing extraordinarily high levels of dissatisfaction with what those [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4159.5s)]
*  States and especially what those political classes are delivering. So in many ways [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4165.5s)]
*  What we're seeing is the exhaustion of the ability of of political classes of the older political parties [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4170.86s)]
*  to actually deliver the public good and [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4177.259999999999s)]
*  Uh, that is not alien to the united states but [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4180.14s)]
*  Take that and amplify it in in country after country where it's much more extreme [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4184.62s)]
*  Uh, and so there you have people like bukele who is new [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4190.78s)]
*  But populism is old in latin america. This is a the the non-ideological [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4195.1s)]
*  Strongman is an old story. It's the oldest story in in latin america. So this is a new packaging of an old [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4199.98s)]
*  Tradition yeah, and and and you know [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4207.66s)]
*  We will [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4211.179999999999s)]
*  As with here, I guess it's just the fires that we're going to be living with and hopefully, you know that we can control [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4212.299999999999s)]
*  Do you see I mean to try to wind down on a happier note. I mean [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4217.58s)]
*  Where do you see? [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4222.219999999999s)]
*  promising signs of governance [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4223.82s)]
*  In latin america, I mean is there are there models that might [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4227.0199999999995s)]
*  Be looked to as you know [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4231.0199999999995s)]
*  Hey, this is somebody or some party or some place that is figuring this out [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4233.58s)]
*  Yeah [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4238.06s)]
*  And I think ben that's really important because okay a couple of things one the biggest driver of migration to the united states [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4238.3s)]
*  There is certainly violence. There is poverty latin america recovered very slowly from covid [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4245.42s)]
*  but the truth is the biggest draw to the united states is is the booming u.s economy and [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4250.7s)]
*  People are moving for rational reasons. They want a job in a in a market that's working [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4255.66s)]
*  uh [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4260.62s)]
*  But the fact is that despite all of the challenges that we see in in latin america [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4261.66s)]
*  Like the quality of life has improved dramatically over the last 30 and 40 years [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4267.74s)]
*  People's access to basic services has increased and improved dramatically the perception of high levels of crime is the one major outlier [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4272.38s)]
*  That we see there because it's not just a perception. In fact, it is more violent unlike the united states [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4280.0599999999995s)]
*  It is more violent in latin america than it was in the past [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4284.46s)]
*  And so [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4287.58s)]
*  It's something that can be managed in terms of human capital in terms of [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4288.620000000001s)]
*  innovation in terms of just drive [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4293.26s)]
*  that's very present in in country after country and in terms of [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4296.38s)]
*  You know models that work I would say that [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4301.900000000001s)]
*  They're not necessarily models that would work in the united states [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4305.26s)]
*  But you're talking about developing countries with a different need so countries that invest heavily in lower middle income [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4307.42s)]
*  Are seeing a return on that they see people brought into the economy. So even um, look there's a lot of [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4315.0199999999995s)]
*  Amluk has it faces a lot of criticism from the united states, but even his detractors [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4322.0599999999995s)]
*  uh and [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4326.78s)]
*  Some of whom I you know, I really highly respect [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4328.94s)]
*  Acknowledge that he's hit a chord [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4331.48s)]
*  He struck a chord because he's delivering sort of public service to a part of the population that's felt forgotten [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4332.94s)]
*  there are other places in in the region where [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4338.54s)]
*  Um [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4342.46s)]
*  People are able to kind of see that see that improvement [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4343.98s)]
*  As well at again at the lower end of the economic [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4348.54s)]
*  Stratus [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4352.86s)]
*  The here's like let me just say there's a couple of long-term things that are really important latin america is the largest provider of food [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4353.9s)]
*  In the world when you combine it with the united states [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4361.099999999999s)]
*  Brazil alone is one of the largest producers of corn and soy and proteins [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4363.98s)]
*  Argentina as well for all the problems argentina has suffered remains this massive provider and we're seeing that kind of thing [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4369.04s)]
*  In in peru in countries, you don't necessarily think of this powerhouses, but these are really important countries to the world [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4376.88s)]
*  And in terms of global insecurity global food insecurity [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4383.4400000000005s)]
*  Is solved in the americas first and foremost [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4386.8s)]
*  uh, so [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4389.76s)]
*  There is a lot to be uh [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4391.360000000001s)]
*  Optimistic about but we have to be also realistic about what people are actually dealing with in real life in latin america [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4394.08s)]
*  Yeah, no. Well look that uh, that's a good tour of the horizon there and in ecuador specifically [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4400.32s)]
*  Sounds like it's you know, it's going to be a long-term [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4406.32s)]
*  challenge, hopefully not as long as columbia was but uh [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4410.4s)]
*  It feels like it's just you know, going to be flaring up for a while here, right? [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4413.599999999999s)]
*  It's going to take a long time to deal with these problems. These are very deep seated [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4417.5199999999995s)]
*  There there are ways to at least slow down [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4422.400000000001s)]
*  What they're saying, but it's going to take years. These are structural issues. These are built into [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4425.4400000000005s)]
*  Societies and you also again, they're international. Yeah, so it's going to take I mean, I think the real fight and the real [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4430.72s)]
*  The what's new here [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4437.84s)]
*  Is the level of sophistication of organized crime and I think all governments have to kind of figure out that this is a different [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4439.92s)]
*  Moment, yeah and approach them that way. Yeah. No, that's a good way of framing it [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4447.12s)]
*  Well, look, thanks so much for joining us people can hear [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkmPKCna3-s&t=4451.759999999999s)]
