# BREAKING: Trump Explodes in Oval Office Meeting with Zelensky
**Pod Save the World:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0)
*  Welcome back to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Ben Rhodes. We are doing a little YouTube exclusive episode today [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=0.0s)]
*  Based off of President Zelensky's meeting with Donald Trump just now. We were gonna plan to do this regardless [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=7.4s)]
*  But then I didn't expect it to be [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  the worst [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=16.52s)]
*  The worst meeting ever in the Oval Office. I'm trying to think of an example of a meeting that went worse [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=17.88s)]
*  I mean there was the infamous [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=22.62s)]
*  Bibi Net Yahoo Obama meeting that you and I were both in the room for but it was nothing even close to what happened [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=24.4s)]
*  Not even close, yeah [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=29.16s)]
*  This is unlike anything that has taken place in my entire lifetime [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=30.56s)]
*  and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=34.92s)]
*  you know, I [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=36.32s)]
*  Have to mind my brain. I mean, I assume there were some tough meetings, you know in the Civil War [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=38.16s)]
*  But yeah, never never we've never seen anything like it. Yeah, okay [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=46.32s)]
*  Well, we'll cut to the chase and start to play you some of that. We have a very long clip [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=49.96s)]
*  And we're gonna play some excerpts pause and talk about them and play some more because honestly it was just impossible to cut it down [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=54.36s)]
*  It was that much of a fucking train wreck [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=59.96s)]
*  So with that here is a clip from Zelensky and Trump's meeting in the Oval Office today Friday, February 28th [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=62.32s)]
*  He broken this ceasefire. He killed our people and he didn't exchange prisoners [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=70.08s)]
*  We signed the exchange of prisoners, but he didn't do it [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=75.86s)]
*  What kind of diplomacy [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=80.1s)]
*  JG you are speaking about what what what do you mean? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=82.1s)]
*  I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's gonna end the destruction of your country. Yes, but Mr. President, Mr. President with respect [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=85.34s)]
*  I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office try to litigate this in front of the American media [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=91.94s)]
*  right now you guys are going around and [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=96.5s)]
*  Forcing conscripts to the front lines because you have manpower problems [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=99.1s)]
*  You should be thanking the president for trying to bring it into this conflict [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=102.86s)]
*  That you say what problems we have I have been to come one [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=107.18s)]
*  I have actually I've actually watched and seen the stories and I know what happens is you bring people you bring them on a [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=111.34s)]
*  Propaganda tour. Mr. President. Okay, stop. Yeah, okay stops the worst. Okay, stop episode in history [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=118.58000000000001s)]
*  So what you can hear there is Zelensky's does his windup where he's talking about how you we can't trust Putin to implement a ceasefire [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=124.98s)]
*  Because he breaks every agreement he's ever signed and actually I was just watching Mike Pompeo on Fox News talking about how the United States [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=130.70000000000002s)]
*  Pulled out of all these arms control agreements during the first Trump administration because Trump gives Putin was breaking the terms of the deal [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=136.26s)]
*  But you know, it was hard to tell exactly what kind of sets the meeting off here Ben [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=142.85999999999999s)]
*  but um [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=147.85999999999999s)]
*  I do think JD Vance is kind of the chief arsonist because [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=148.56s)]
*  Zelensky pretty quickly calls him out and is like, okay, you seem to know a lot about my country [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=152.82s)]
*  Have you ever been there and obviously? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=156.1s)]
*  Obviously JD Vance has not and he flips out about it and just I guess says that any visit to Ukraine is a propaganda tour [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=158.62s)]
*  Yeah, two things stand out to me about this first just so people know what? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=166.12s)]
*  Zelensky's talking about he's talking about the Minsk agreement [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=170.08s)]
*  that was reached in the late Obama administration to essentially freeze the conflict and have some kind of process whereby the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=173.16s)]
*  Ukrainians had [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=181.4s)]
*  Autonomous regions in these places where the Russians had invaded in eastern Ukraine and what he's saying is [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  Putin broke the ceasefire the last time someone tried to do what Trump's doing [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=190.36s)]
*  you know Putin is the one that violated the agreement and [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=194.12s)]
*  Reinvaded the country and and dramatically escalated and and that's just a fact. It's not an opinion, you know [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  So this is gonna be a recurring theme here that Zelensky's saying facts and JD Vance and Trump are just basically offering [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=204.12s)]
*  Kremlin talking points and response and then tell me I said this to you [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=211.68s)]
*  But for JD Vance to refer to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=216.32s)]
*  visits that people make to Ukraine as propaganda tours was one of the most triggering things and [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=219.44s)]
*  Many that were said today because what people do when they go to Ukraine is they they often visit Buccia for instance [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=224.72s)]
*  Where there were war crimes committed where innocent civilians were massacred where children were killed and to call that a propaganda tour [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=230.2s)]
*  Is so beyond the pale. It's essentially [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=237.88s)]
*  Him calling the truth propaganda when people go to Ukraine what they see is the reality of a country that's been invaded and bombarded and had [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=242.28s)]
*  Tens of thousands of children kidnapped and tens of thousands of people killed and JD Vance calls that the propaganda and it's it's up is down [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=249.08s)]
*  It's you know, black is white. It's just 180 degrees wrong [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=257.08000000000004s)]
*  And I agree with you Tommy it felt like JD Vance was setting a trap like he was getting [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=260.68s)]
*  Trying to provoke Zelensky to say something that would piss off Trump. Yeah, which is [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=266.16s)]
*  Which is a pretty fucking dark role for him to be playing but just to be clear [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=271.44s)]
*  This meeting was extensively about signing some sort of deal between the US and Ukrainians about rare earth minerals in reality [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=275.52s)]
*  It seems like it was a setup to get to exactly this moment [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  so JD Vance and Donald Trump could harangue Zelensky in front of the cameras and show what a tough guy they are and [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=286.59999999999997s)]
*  You know, you know beat their chest on Fox News later, but Ben, I'm glad you mentioned [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=293.56s)]
*  Buccia because you know, that's another triggering thing for me because you often hear these same conservatives [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=298.88s)]
*  I should Democrats to talk about how there were some early peace talks between the Ukrainians and the Russians [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=304.4s)]
*  But they blew up and they often blamed Zelensky for pulling out of those talks [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=310.92s)]
*  in fact those talks blew up because the atrocities that occurred at Buccia were [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=314.24s)]
*  Revealed and it became impossible for anyone in Ukraine to imagine cutting a deal with Putin and the Russians in that moment [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=320.12s)]
*  Yeah, and and this this context was entirely missing they seem to be offended by Zelensky [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=328.64s)]
*  Pointing out that his country was invaded by Putin that that seemed to offend [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=335.36s)]
*  Trump and JD Vance and and I think another piece of context here Tommy is [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=340.08s)]
*  Zelensky is is a profoundly exhausted person. You know, you can see it on his face. You can see on his face [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=346.04s)]
*  I've heard this from some Europeans [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=351.24s)]
*  like he [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=353.6s)]
*  You know this this guy probably barely sleeps at night [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=354.96s)]
*  He has been besieged by the Trump administration bullied into trying to sign this absurd deal for [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=358.96s)]
*  Critical minerals and he flies to Washington because he feels this thing slipping away from him this thing being US support [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=365.91999999999996s)]
*  As kind of a Hail Mary and then he sits down and they bring the cameras in and he just starts getting insulted [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=373.44s)]
*  To his face by people who can demonstrate no degree of empathy [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=379.36s)]
*  I mean like they don't even not even a perfunctory, you know [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=384.64000000000004s)]
*  Tributes to what the people of Ukraine have done and and they insulted not just as Alonso is important [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=388.36s)]
*  They insulted the Ukrainian people. He said the only people you can get to fight are conscripts that you forced to the front line [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=393.8s)]
*  So that's insulting the troops that's insulting the Ukrainians that have been fighting and saying they don't want to be there [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=399.96000000000004s)]
*  They're only there because Zelensky made them go there when in fact Putin is the one [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=405.22s)]
*  that conscripts people Putin is the one that did the mobilization and so [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=408.92s)]
*  We can talk later about whether it's one ski aired tactically here [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=414.44s)]
*  But I'm I've agreed to have empathy for what he had to go through. Yeah, I mean look your your Trump being [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=417.92s)]
*  Offended by reality and people insulting Zelensky is gonna be a theme of this thing that press court even gets in on the action [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=423.36s)]
*  But we'll get to that in a minute, but let's keep rolling that clip. Do you disagree that you've had problems? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=429.5s)]
*  Bringing people into your military and do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=434.48s)]
*  The administration that is trying to trying to prevent the destruction of your country a lot of questions [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=441.5s)]
*  Let's start from the big sure first of all during the war [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=446.6s)]
*  Everybody has problems even you but you have nice ocean and don't feel now [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=450.38s)]
*  But you will feel it in the future. God bless. You don't know that God bless. You're not [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=455.5s)]
*  Don't tell us what we're gonna feel we're trying to solve a problem. Don't tell us what we're gonna feel [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=462.12s)]
*  I'm not telling you because you're in no position to dictate that remember that you're in no position [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=467.2s)]
*  To dictate what we're gonna feel you. We're gonna feel very good [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=472.84s)]
*  We're gonna feel very good and very strong. You're right now. Not in a very good position [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=477.91999999999996s)]
*  You've allowed yourself to be in a very bad position [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=483.91999999999996s)]
*  And he's happens to be right about from the very beginning of the war you're not in a good position [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=486.64000000000004s)]
*  I was you don't have the cards right now with us you start having not going car right now. You don't [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=490.92s)]
*  You're gambling with the lives of millions of people you're gambling with World War three [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=499.04s)]
*  You're gambling with World War three and what you're doing is very [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=504.56s)]
*  Disrespectful to the country this country. I'm back to you far more than a lot of people said [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=510.32000000000005s)]
*  They should have you said thank you once that entire meeting. No in this entire meeting. You said thank you [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=516.64s)]
*  You went to Pennsylvania and campaign for the opposition in October offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=522.24s)]
*  Okay, stop JD Vance [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=529.84s)]
*  Just gave up the whole game there. They are offended by a [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=532.76s)]
*  campaign period [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=538.24s)]
*  visit by Zelensky to [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=540.12s)]
*  Pennsylvania [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=542.92s)]
*  Where which was perceived as an endorsement or support for Joe Biden? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=543.92s)]
*  Jeez Ben I wonder why Zelensky might have thought he'd be better off if Joe Biden was president or Kamala Harris was president and not [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=548.6s)]
*  Donald Trump as he's lecturing him in the Oval Office about how he's gambling and about to start World War three [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=557.04s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot in that one too. Tommy. I mean first of all [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=562.04s)]
*  Boy to say that Zelensky is the one that's gambling with World War three when Putin is the one that invaded the country [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=566.76s)]
*  I mean the Ukrainians didn't want they don't want to be in this war and that's what is pulling out support for NATO [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=571.84s)]
*  Which has prevented World War three. Yeah. Yeah, like what's so fucking bonkers about this is like the the [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=576.96s)]
*  All the things that Trump advanced say presuppose that Zelensky somehow wants this war and wanted this war when he was just invaded by Russia [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=583.64s)]
*  They're the ones that raised the risks of World War three then to hear them [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=590.76s)]
*  Lecture him about needing to thank mr. Trump, you know [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=595.0s)]
*  First of all, Zelensky always thanks the United States [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=599.56s)]
*  Repeatedly, he's done it by the way since Trump has been president expressed gratitude for the support the United States supplies even though by the way [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=602.52s)]
*  Donald Trump is not the one that provided that support. It was Joe Biden in the United States Congress by part on a bipartisan basis [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=609.64s)]
*  But they want Zelensky to behave like you know a Trump staffer there. Thank you. Mr [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=615.48s)]
*  Trump for being such a great president and [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=621.0s)]
*  They don't do this to other leaders, you know, they don't Hector other leaders like this in the Oval Office [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=623.0s)]
*  They you know, they they they they they're picking on him [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=628.84s)]
*  They're like schoolyard boys picking on a small injured person to impress their friends [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=632.44s)]
*  And it's like a three-on-one you can hear all of them like chatting. I'll be like, yes, you were mean [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=637.72s)]
*  Yes, you did say that it literally sounds like a schoolyard taunting and like he didn't insult when he insults [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=641.56s)]
*  Do you know what they're referring to? He shouldn't insult the u.s. He just explained it [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=646.84s)]
*  Insult the u.s. He just explained facts facts are insulting to Trump is mad [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=651.4s)]
*  It's earlier on in this Oval Office meeting because this was a very very long pool spray and just like to give folks a little context [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=655.72s)]
*  What usually happens is? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=661.0s)]
*  The two leaders go into the Oval Office [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=662.52s)]
*  They sit down you bring the pool the White House press pool in for like a minute or two [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=664.52s)]
*  Sometimes there's a shout of question they take photos and then they get them the hell out of there [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=669.72s)]
*  They have the real meeting there was supposed to be a lunch and then they're supposed to be a press conference [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=673.32s)]
*  Trump has started doing this thing where he takes like 45 minutes worth of questions [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=677.0s)]
*  During the pool spray and then they do the press conference just because he needs to be on tv all the time [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=680.76s)]
*  So what you didn't hear that happened earlier? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=685.4s)]
*  Was you know trump's entire schtick about ukraine is the war never would have happened if he was president [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=688.0400000000001s)]
*  But zelensky when he was walking through all the times the russians broke ceasefire agreements talks about how the russians were occupying ukraine [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=692.9200000000001s)]
*  Throughout the duration of the trump presidency and people were getting killed during the trump presidency [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=701.1800000000001s)]
*  And trump really didn't like that because it undercut his whole fucking argument that none of this would have happened if I were in charge [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=707.02s)]
*  Because he acts like he wasn't actually the president for four years and isn't responsible for anything [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=714.14s)]
*  Yeah, and and he needs everything to be about himself and not about like the reality of what is happening in the world [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=718.3000000000001s)]
*  Particularly a reality that is counter to his narrative and inconvenient to him in any way shape or form [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=725.82s)]
*  And and zelensky's this guy who's only trying to share facts [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=732.54s)]
*  you know, uh and [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=736.86s)]
*  each time he does [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=739.1s)]
*  They act as if he has personally offended them and come down even harder on the guy [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=740.94s)]
*  and and by this point in the clip they're just picking on him like and and and to say that because [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=747.02s)]
*  You know, he's not kissing trump's ass he's insulting the whole country [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=753.4200000000001s)]
*  Just shows you what donald trump's view of this country is that that he is the only thing that matters [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=757.98s)]
*  He the leader, you know, he der furer is the only guy [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=763.5s)]
*  He's the symbol of the nation or something. It's it's absolutely grotesque and what we can't see here is like little marco [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=767.5s)]
*  Rubio on the couch like shrinking deeper and deeper into his seat. Yeah, jd vance is like sitting on the edge of his seat [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=774.0600000000001s)]
*  He's the happiest little boy in in town because he was allowed to go to the big boy meeting and say something and marco rubio [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=779.82s)]
*  Every photo of marco rubio that i've seen in the context of these these russia ukraine talks [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=785.74s)]
*  He looks like his soul is is drifting out of his body in that moment. He looks like he's dead inside [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=790.94s)]
*  He knows what is happening is so profoundly wrong, but he just sits there fucking silently [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=796.3000000000001s)]
*  And then afterwards tweets an attaboy at the boss and like there's all these reports that uh, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=802.1400000000001s)]
*  Rubio is like the secretary of state in name only and actually has a bunch of little [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=807.74s)]
*  Kind of nagas supplicants who who work for him on the org chart, but are actually running the show over at state [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=812.14s)]
*  So who knows? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=816.7800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, let's listen to the rest of this clip who's trying to save your country [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=818.22s)]
*  It's going to be a very hard thing to do business like this. I tell you say thank you [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=822.94s)]
*  I said a little except that they're accepted American accept that there are disagreements and let's go [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=827.9s)]
*  Litigate those disagreements rather than trying to fight it out in the american media when you're wrong [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=833.74s)]
*  We know that you're wrong, but you see I think it's good for the american people to see what's going on [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=839.18s)]
*  I think it's very important. That's why I kept this going so long [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=843.98s)]
*  Uh trump, uh ends the and ends the meeting later and says, uh, this is going to be great television [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=847.5s)]
*  So again giving up the game. This is all about politics for them. They don't care about ukraine [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=852.86s)]
*  They don't actually care about anything zelensky said [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=858.14s)]
*  Um, this is just domestic politics. Yeah, and they're just [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=861.18s)]
*  you know, like [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=865.5s)]
*  What is he wrong about? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=867.1s)]
*  You know, like like nothing that zelensky said we can again we'll talk later about like what his tactical decision making was [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=868.22s)]
*  But like nothing he said was wrong and jd vance doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=874.14s)]
*  He's not some expert on like ukraine and russia. He's just some guy who listened to some podcasts [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=878.54s)]
*  Yeah, and and tries to put nothing wrong with that [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=884.62s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, nothing wrong with that. Sorry about that [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=887.42s)]
*  All of you people this is youtube. This is youtube. Yeah, exactly [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=889.5s)]
*  Yeah, but then I think it's it's worth noting like the meeting didn't start [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=893.9s)]
*  Terribly again, like we said there was like a 30 minute pool spray [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=898.4399999999999s)]
*  There was actually some like kind of chummy moments. Let's just play a quick clip of that because europe really helped president trump said that they [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=902.06s)]
*  made [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=908.6999999999999s)]
*  Less support but they have our friends and they are our very supportive [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=910.06s)]
*  partners they really [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=915.5s)]
*  gave [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=917.0999999999999s)]
*  A lot [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=918.0600000000001s)]
*  Mr. Brett. Yeah, really they did [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=919.02s)]
*  I think a lot but they gave much less. No [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=921.4200000000001s)]
*  much less [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=924.3000000000001s)]
*  So right there, you know zelensky's talking about contributions from the europeans, uh to ukraine [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=931.1800000000001s)]
*  This is like the third time in a week that trump has been corrected in the oval office about [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=936.14s)]
*  Uh the european contribution to the ukrainian side remember in the in the meeting with french president aminu macron macron [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=941.9s)]
*  Like grabs his arm and is like actually no 60 percent of what we gave them was a grant not alone [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=947.5s)]
*  Uh kier starmer made the same point yesterday. I believe thursday and then zelensky today [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=953.34s)]
*  But you know there it was kind of like look zelensky had a look on his face where as you said then he looked exhausted [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=959.1s)]
*  Uh by the end of this conversation. He looks like he wants to cry but it didn't start [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=966.14s)]
*  Terribly like things just escalated and got worse or worse [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=970.6s)]
*  Yeah, but it felt like the that that jd vance and trump wanted some version of this outcome [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=973.66s)]
*  They didn't want to go exactly like this [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=979.02s)]
*  But they wanted to smack him around and say he was say he was ungrateful and tell him to thank mr [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=980.3s)]
*  Trump and and again what I find so [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=985.5s)]
*  Appalling about it, but it's interesting. We have to understand this is that you know trump's, you know [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=988.62s)]
*  the headline in foreign policy is he's completely switched sides and [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=993.8199999999999s)]
*  It's now the u.s and russia against europe and ukraine [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=997.98s)]
*  The u.s wanting to be in this alignment with big autocratic countries russia china the gulf, etc [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1001.34s)]
*  But it also mirrors tommy like what trump does at home like he doesn't really pick on people's own size [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1007.34s)]
*  You know, it's it's it's in undocumented people. It's trans people [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1012.5400000000001s)]
*  You know, it's a country that's been invaded like ukraine [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1018.0600000000001s)]
*  It's people in gaza that he's dunking on and posting, you know weird videos about [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1021.26s)]
*  You know the riviera of that he's gonna build like this guy is not tough tough people [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1026.7s)]
*  Like would pick on pudin tough people would like not be terrified [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1033.82s)]
*  of pudin and [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1039.58s)]
*  Beating the shit out of zelensky on television and then telling him it's his fault and guess who sees that the world sees that like [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1041.58s)]
*  Maga base will you know be like, oh, this is great. Look at trump [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1048.6200000000001s)]
*  Own own the libs because they think zelensky. I mean your point about pennsylvania. It's not just that it's you gave up the game on that [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1052.5400000000002s)]
*  but they also equate like [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1059.18s)]
*  ukraine with kind of libs or something [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1061.88s)]
*  Which is super weird by the way, because it used to be the opposite that like [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1064.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, then obama was weak because he didn't give enough support to ukrainians. That was the talking point forever [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1067.98s)]
*  you know now obama looks like you know, a lot much different light compared to trump, but I mean [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1072.14s)]
*  I mean [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1077.98s)]
*  These the rest of the world doesn't live in the maga verse, you know [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1079.1799999999998s)]
*  The rest of the world lives in reality and they're just seeing like a bully picking on something smaller to make himself look tough [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1083.1s)]
*  Yeah [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1089.1s)]
*  So again, this was supposed to be the pool spray before the lunch meeting before the press conference the trump people ended up [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1089.82s)]
*  Canceling the rest of the itinerary and you know the according to the readouts they're giving to fox news or whoever else [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1097.08s)]
*  Uh, it sounds like uh, the rubio and mike waltz basically kicked zelensky out of the white house and said come back [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1103.02s)]
*  when you're ready to [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1109.82s)]
*  Cut a peace deal. Um, they were supposed to sign some sort of rare earths [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1111.5s)]
*  agreement [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1116.9199999999998s)]
*  This the the text of this agreement has evolved so much over time like initially it was reported as just like a extortion [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1118.1399999999999s)]
*  The u.s. Demanding half of ukraine's rare earths are [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1125.5s)]
*  Up to 500 billion dollars worth of rare earths now [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1128.7s)]
*  It seemed like there would just be some sort of joint effort to mine these rare earths and put it into a fund [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1131.5s)]
*  That would then be used for ukrainian reconstruction [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1137.4199999999998s)]
*  But the u.s [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1139.8999999999999s)]
*  Would have some sort of oversight over it and maybe get some of the profits. I don't know [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1140.54s)]
*  I'm, not sure that we'll ever know caitlin collins from cnn asked a very smart question [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1144.22s)]
*  During this press conference, which is that something like 40 percent of ukraine's rare earths are in the far east [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1149.4199999999998s)]
*  So in russian occupied areas she was like [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1155.3400000000001s)]
*  Are you going to be able to get access to those who will protect those? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1159.02s)]
*  There's been a lot of reporting today about how you know the sort of mining process for these rare earth elements is [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1162.94s)]
*  Unbelievably energy and labor intensive and incredibly dirty and setting up, you know a giant lithium mine [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1169.16s)]
*  For example, it can take a decade [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1175.18s)]
*  So the idea that this is some sort of immediate u.s [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1176.6200000000001s)]
*  Ukranian cooperation on the ground that serves as a de facto deterrent from the russians [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1179.98s)]
*  Invading is just like sort of nonsensical on its face if you actually understand the details [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1185.0s)]
*  But uh ben, I don't know that we'll ever need to know the details of this one because it doesn't seem like it's happening [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1189.42s)]
*  Yeah, I mean the whole purpose of this was to again further make trump look tough [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1194.22s)]
*  Like he got ukraine to bend to his will and give us access to these [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1198.78s)]
*  rare earth materials that as you said [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1203.5s)]
*  Take you know, these would not be mined in trump's presidency, uh, and if and when they are [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1206.38s)]
*  So what what is it? What on earth does this have to do with ending the war? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1213.1000000000001s)]
*  It has nothing to do with ending the war [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1216.14s)]
*  It's not a security guarantee to ukraine to say that like there might be some [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1218.3000000000002s)]
*  Joint ventures down the line to get some [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1222.7s)]
*  Rare earth materials that trump probably doesn't even know what they do, you know [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1225.42s)]
*  I mean, so this always felt like this kind of weird facade [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1228.38s)]
*  Um, and I do just you know to put a point on it like waltz and rubio [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1231.98s)]
*  For them to be going along with this charade like fucking you know ribbentrop the nazi foreign minister like [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1237.26s)]
*  The they these guys were talking tough about ukraine like a year ago. They were you know [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1243.5s)]
*  This is what happens when you sell your soul to donald trump, you know, and [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1249.8200000000002s)]
*  if there's one thing that zelensky's visit achieved is [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1253.26s)]
*  It it exposed the full truth of what he's dealing with [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1257.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean like there is sort of there is a there is a national security challenge for the u.s [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1261.34s)]
*  Which is that I think china has something like 70 of the rare earth elements supply [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1266.78s)]
*  They also have something like 90 of the refining capacity [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1272.3799999999999s)]
*  So there could be a scenario where the u.s really needs access to these rare earth minerals [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1276.06s)]
*  But like you just said, I mean, this is like a decade-long process [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1281.02s)]
*  and i've been I remember having a very similar conversation about [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1284.22s)]
*  You know people saying there were massive deposits like trillion dollar deposits in afghanistan that none of those have been mined even as of today [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1288.0600000000002s)]
*  So all of this just seems like very vaporware [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1295.18s)]
*  No, it's a huge issue. But ironically tommy. I know a lot about this issue [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1298.14s)]
*  From the prism of climate change because these are critical to battery technologies to solar panels and the chinese way ahead [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1303.18s)]
*  And and the reality is if you really cared about it [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1309.74s)]
*  You wouldn't dismantle usaid [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1311.8200000000002s)]
*  Because you'd be trying to be in africa where there's a ton of these critical minerals or place in south america [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1313.82s)]
*  There are a ton of critical minerals and in places that are not currently invaded by russia like, you know [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1319.1799999999998s)]
*  Making agreements with chile which has a lot of these deposits would be a lot more rational [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1324.54s)]
*  Than saying we're going to solve our rare earth materials by getting mining rights [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1329.74s)]
*  In ukraine, you know that has currently been attacked. It's purely for show for yeah purely for show [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1334.3s)]
*  Uh, okay. Well [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1340.46s)]
*  Like we mentioned earlier, uh, zelensky wasn't just insulted by jd vance and rubio and waltz and trump [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1342.06s)]
*  There were a bunch of moron reporters in the oval office because as you might have heard [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1349.58s)]
*  The white house is taking over control [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1354.46s)]
*  Of the white house press pool and instead of having like real serious journalists in there from places like reuters or bloomberg [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1357.26s)]
*  They're swapping in right wing zealots who are just their little propagandists [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1364.86s)]
*  So, uh, let's hear an example of what kind of questions those people ask. Do you ever why don't you wear a suit? [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1369.5s)]
*  Why don't you wear a suit you're the highest level in this country's office and you refuse to wear a suit [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1376.94s)]
*  Just want to see if you do own a suit. Yeah. Yeah problems [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1382.46s)]
*  A lot of americans have problems with you not really I don't have such [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1386.3s)]
*  Uh, I will wear a costume after this war will finish [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1390.46s)]
*  Yes, maybe [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1394.78s)]
*  One maybe something like yours. Yes, maybe some something better. I don't I don't know [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1396.78s)]
*  We will see maybe something cheaper than yeah [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1402.46s)]
*  Thank you [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1406.46s)]
*  That was a reporter named brian glenn, he's the chief white house correspondent for real america's voice [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1409.26s)]
*  Uh, there was a reporter from one america, which is another right wing outlet then that asked [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1415.82s)]
*  What gave you the moral courage and conviction to lead on a peace agreement? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1420.3s)]
*  Uh apparently a reporter from tas snuck into the oval office pool spray for those who don't know [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1425.02s)]
*  Uh tas is a russian state-owned news agency founded in uh, the 1900s. So [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1431.6599999999999s)]
*  Interesting move to let the russian state-owned media, you know the country bombing [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1437.8999999999999s)]
*  The the country you're meeting with into the oval office spray. They apparently the white house staff said he snuck in there somehow [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1442.7s)]
*  It doesn't give me a lot of um [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1448.86s)]
*  Confidence in their in their security. I'm not sure how you sneak into the oval office, but I don't know man [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1451.02s)]
*  Like this is this is bleak shit. Well, you know, first of all, the real america news guy was probably slobbering over elon musk [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1455.8999999999999s)]
*  In the cabinet meeting yesterday when he was not wearing a suit was wearing a t-shirt was wearing a hat [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1463.6599999999999s)]
*  And was like amped up on god knows what good standing up jumping up and down being a fucking lunatic, right? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1470.2199999999998s)]
*  So why is elon musk allowed to like, you know? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1476.2199999999998s)]
*  In this guy's view denigrate the white house the oval office by not wearing a suit. I mean like can you imagine [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1480.3s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1487.58s)]
*  Being ukrainian and looking at this. I mean zelensky dresses like that in solidarity with people in his country [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1489.8999999999999s)]
*  You know, he wears military colored clothes to express solidarity with troops. You're fighting the front line [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1495.26s)]
*  You don't have to think that's a great, you know [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1499.6599999999999s)]
*  sartorial choice [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1502.28s)]
*  Uh, but to to fucking just pick on him [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1503.6599999999999s)]
*  Who's what danger is that guy ever been under zelensky could have been assassinated in the early days of the war like there was yeah [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1507.1000000000001s)]
*  Incredible reports are all kinds of bounties on his head and this kind of complete fucking loser from real america news [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1513.42s)]
*  Is picking on him to make himself look good in front of mr. Trump and whoever his audience is [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1520.0600000000002s)]
*  uh, and then the toss thing [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1525.66s)]
*  Let's just be very clear here like russian state media, which I think was like sanctioned or designated [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1528.38s)]
*  I know I was trying to remember that yeah, they were definitely like a part of some, you know [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1534.22s)]
*  One of the things the biden administration rolled out [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1538.46s)]
*  But russian state media is allowed in the oval office in the associated press [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1540.22s)]
*  The wire service for more american newspapers than anybody else is not because they won't call it the gulf of america [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1544.22s)]
*  Like this is where we are people like we are in a reality in which russian state media and russian propaganda [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1550.54s)]
*  Is in the oval office? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1558.62s)]
*  berating a [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1560.6799999999998s)]
*  Democrats the elected leader of a country under attack, you know who's being insulted for not wearing a suit [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1561.86s)]
*  um, I mean [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1568.52s)]
*  We just have to get our minds around this thing because we're only six weeks into it, you know [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1570.84s)]
*  Yeah, I know like american politics are so unserious. It's so frustrating but this moment really drove home for me [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1574.2s)]
*  I just I can imagine, you know, this is an existential meeting for the people of ukraine and for zelensky [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1580.6s)]
*  um [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1586.12s)]
*  literally and [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1587.0s)]
*  You know suddenly he's getting berated about his appearance. I mean, it's just like truly outrageous [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1588.44s)]
*  So then I mean the big picture question is like where do we go from here? [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1593.3200000000002s)]
*  Because this meeting was a disaster. I mean, i'm sure zelensky will try to kind of mop it up [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1596.76s)]
*  He's doing a tv appearance with brett bear on fox news later tonight that I think he knows [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1602.1200000000001s)]
*  Will be a sort of a direct line back into the oval office to communicate with trump [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1607.0800000000002s)]
*  It's been interesting to watch this week. You had macron kier starmer and zelensky [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1611.0s)]
*  All have white house meetings and then all go on brett bear's show [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1615.96s)]
*  It's become kind of the the car wash equivalent like when you go to esbn you do like a bunch of shows now [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1618.84s)]
*  brett bears the car wash but yesterday [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1623.64s)]
*  Putin was speaking he was praising the new u.s administration for quote pragmatism a realistic worldview [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1626.52s)]
*  Discarding many of stereotypes so-called rules and messianic ideological cliches of their predecessors [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1632.98s)]
*  Uh, you had jimitry medvedev [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1639.0s)]
*  Uh cheering and tweeting in english about how great it was to see delensky treated like shit [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1641.32s)]
*  And then yesterday when when trump was meeting with kier starmer the british prime minister [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1647.4s)]
*  Trump refused to say that the u.s [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1652.28s)]
*  Would backstop a european peacekeeping force if one were to be put in ukraine after some sort of peace deal [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1654.52s)]
*  Um, he also seemed to once again [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1661.08s)]
*  Suggest the u.s wasn't fully committed to to article 5 when he was asked about it [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1663.48s)]
*  He was like, oh the brits they don't need much help [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1667.48s)]
*  They can take care of themselves and then at one point he said to kira starmer [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1669.16s)]
*  Could you take on russia by yourselves? [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1672.8400000000001s)]
*  You know like kind of joking but not really so I don't know pretty dark man [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1674.8400000000001s)]
*  Like where do you think that we go from here again? [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1678.52s)]
*  I think if there's any utility in in this, you know, because you might say [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1681.0s)]
*  Zelensky should have just shut his mouth and taken it and then tried to sign his rare steel and you know [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1684.98s)]
*  But actually I think it's something useful in just surfacing this, you know and just clarifying. This is where we are [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1691.0800000000002s)]
*  We've learned that trump has flipped 180 degrees to the russian side [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1696.76s)]
*  We've learned that his approach to peace is to bully ukraine and ask nothing of russia [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1700.36s)]
*  We've learned that the republican party in the united states has completed the process of not having any spine [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1705.32s)]
*  And capitulating to trump's foreign policy [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1711.86s)]
*  And so what does it mean going forward if i'm europe and ukraine? [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1715.0s)]
*  i'm saying [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1718.52s)]
*  We need to develop a shared position [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1719.56s)]
*  for this war [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1721.9599999999998s)]
*  That is separate from the united states of america and actually sees that this is the united states and russia [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1723.4s)]
*  Sitting on one side of the negotiating table and europe and ukraine sitting on the other [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1730.0400000000002s)]
*  And as dark and as extreme as that sounds I think that's where we are [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1734.52s)]
*  And so they the because ukrainians by the way don't have to stop fighting [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1737.48s)]
*  You know, there were reports early in the in the invasion when russia thought they were going to roll over keev [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1740.76s)]
*  That they were going to have a guerrilla warfare type approach [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1746.2s)]
*  So the ukrainians don't have to like agree to trump's terms that he strikes with moscow [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1749.0800000000002s)]
*  I think the ukrainians need to figure out with the europeans [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1753.64s)]
*  What are their positions? What are they insisting on they're going to have to give a bunch of stuff including territory? [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1756.92s)]
*  But what can they what can they insist on in terms of like a credible? [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1762.6000000000001s)]
*  Ceasefire line essentially and then what is a peace force? [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1766.3600000000001s)]
*  That has you know british and french troops. There's an interesting comment from turkey that they might get involved with troops on the ground [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1770.68s)]
*  What is a credible european force that can provide some security guarantee and some presence there? [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1778.68s)]
*  And then how do you build a european defense and foreign policy that is totally separate from the united states? [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1783.72s)]
*  Because the united states has switched sides [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1788.6000000000001s)]
*  you know and and I [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1791.0s)]
*  I wish that wasn't the case [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1793.4s)]
*  But I think that's where we are and I don't know that just like signing some dumb rare earth thing is going to make trump [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1794.52s)]
*  Be nicer to them. It's not so [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1800.44s)]
*  Figure out your own interest and act accordingly. It's what all of us are going to have to do in these trump years [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1802.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean look the more we learned about the rare earths agreement the more it just seemed like nothing [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1807.0s)]
*  You know like initially it just sounded like complete extortion and now I don't even know what it was [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1812.1200000000001s)]
*  um, I do think you know to your question we should ask like did zelensky screw up I think [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1816.76s)]
*  I give him [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1823.08s)]
*  Like all like I have so much sympathy for him, but I think the answer is kind of of course he did [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1824.44s)]
*  I mean challenging jd vance [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1828.92s)]
*  Getting into that pissing match like it [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1831.24s)]
*  Like we can look at inputs dc people look at inputs too much and they don't look at outputs like [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1833.72s)]
*  The end result of that meeting was a fucking disaster for zelensky personally politically and for his country [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1838.2s)]
*  So obviously he should have approached it differently. I think the challenge is he's got politics trump's got politics, right? [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1843.56s)]
*  Like he's not going to walk in there and make a bunch of sort of rhetorical concessions to putin [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1849.64s)]
*  uh before negotiations actually begun a negotiation that he's not part of by the way and [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1854.8400000000001s)]
*  Trump just wouldn't broke any dissent. Um, or or you know, he actually like [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1860.44s)]
*  He mocked [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1867.08s)]
*  Uh zelensky at one point for saying I don't want to ceasefire [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1868.28s)]
*  But zelensky's point was like not that I don't want this the fighting to stop [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1871.7199999999998s)]
*  He's like, I don't want to ceasefire where putin then breaks it over and over again and reinvades my country [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1874.9199999999998s)]
*  So, I mean look, yeah, we'd be like I think dishonest if we said [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1880.36s)]
*  Um that zelensky had played that thing [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1884.04s)]
*  Perfectly but uh or even remotely well, but I do think it was a setup for domestic consumption here in the u.s [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1886.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I I think that like like by any measure like [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1893.8799999999999s)]
*  Tactically, you don't get into a fight with jd vance in the oval office. You don't allow yourself to be [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1898.28s)]
*  Humiliated by the president united states to that extent [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1903.46s)]
*  But i'm not saying this to give him credit because I don't think it was a strategy. I think the the utility in it [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1906.84s)]
*  Is we know what we're dealing with now, right? Like we have [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1913.08s)]
*  The hegseth like laying down of terms without consulting ukraine and europe [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1916.6s)]
*  In which they surrender all their territory and can't be nato with the jd vance speech in munich endorsing the european far-right [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1921.5600000000002s)]
*  We've got trump calling zelensky dictator and now we have this and so there can be a new illusions that somehow [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1927.48s)]
*  Some committee to save america is gonna or marco rubio or whoever [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1935.48s)]
*  Or lindsey graham's gonna the oval office and convince trump to suddenly get tough on the russians [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1940.1200000000001s)]
*  Like so i'm not saying that zelensky was like playing some chess and you know out of this i'm saying [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1944.6000000000001s)]
*  He messed up by getting baited into this but there may be something [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1951.3200000000002s)]
*  Worthwhile that comes out of just clarifying. Okay. This is this is actually where we are, you know [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1956.2s)]
*  And and I can tell you like from [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1961.48s)]
*  You know having been in munich and you know different europeans [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1963.48s)]
*  Like this is what the trump people are like behind closed doors, too [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1966.8400000000001s)]
*  You know like from what I hear like they're not they're not just performing for the cameras [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1969.5600000000002s)]
*  like they this is this is who they are and so [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1973.3200000000002s)]
*  now he's got to go back and I was thinking too tommy like [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1977.16s)]
*  You know, he made that comment about like I will step down if it brings peace like [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1981.8000000000002s)]
*  He's got to be also thinking about [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1986.8400000000001s)]
*  That you know not stepping down now, but like, you know, like what is [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1989.64s)]
*  What like he he's tired. He's clearly a lightning rod to trump because trump wrongly unfairly [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=1994.92s)]
*  sees him as some guy who's like aligned with [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2002.1200000000001s)]
*  things that trump doesn't like like democracies and europeans and [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2005.24s)]
*  And internationalists in this country and [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2009.64s)]
*  And so I think he's got to stand up to trump [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2012.76s)]
*  And try to get the best deal for his people and from the europeans [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2016.3600000000001s)]
*  And then you know, that's that's his mission and then he's done. You're right though [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2020.3600000000001s)]
*  I mean, this is really tough for zelensky because he showed [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2023.72s)]
*  unbelievable incredibly inspiring courage in the very early days of that war and by just sort of like [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2028.02s)]
*  force of personality [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2035.24s)]
*  Brought the entire world to his side helped rally support in the u.s [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2037.08s)]
*  In europe everywhere like public opinion in capitals everywhere [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2041.4s)]
*  And if he is seen now as having kind of lost that touch, I mean, i'm sure [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2045.8s)]
*  The the the shine faded during the biden administration when a lot of ukrainians felt like they were getting some of what they wanted [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2050.76s)]
*  But getting it late and getting it slow and not getting enough of it [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2057.88s)]
*  But this meeting I think um, yeah, it's probably gonna I mean maybe it'll rally people to his side [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2060.76s)]
*  But it might also make them wonder whether he's the right person to be the inner interlocutor with the united states when they're so relying on us [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2065.64s)]
*  So a very challenging political moment for him personally as well as for the country. Yeah. Yeah [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2072.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean if i'm him i'm gonna take a breath [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2078.28s)]
*  And i'm gonna talk. I mean, I I honestly frankly [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2081.0s)]
*  I guess you got to do the brett baer car wash but um [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2084.52s)]
*  He can't just go on there and grovel, you know, uh, and brett baer will be an asshole [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2088.12s)]
*  I as a side note to tommy it's like do you remember like, you know, people would go to foreign leaders go to china [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2092.6000000000004s)]
*  They have to do cctv the state media like fox news has become like the cctv of the us [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2097.5600000000004s)]
*  That's pretty dark too, you know like that. That's not normal people, you know, like [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2104.84s)]
*  There's a lot of other people that you could do interviews with but they know [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2109.5600000000004s)]
*  That they like have to to talk to brett baer and fox news because that's who trump wenson talked to [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2112.92s)]
*  Yep, dear leader will be watching [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2117.96s)]
*  So I will see, you know [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2119.6400000000003s)]
*  I'm sure he'll kind of recalibrate this a little bit but he can't fold or capitulate and that's also not in his character [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2121.2400000000002s)]
*  And I think you go back you talk to mcrone you talk to starmer you talk to mertz and schultz and the germans [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2127.0s)]
*  If you're zelensky and you kind of go back to the drawing board. Okay, like what? [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2134.6000000000004s)]
*  What's our position our being europe and ukraine? [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2138.1200000000003s)]
*  And this negotiation with the u.s and russia. Yeah [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2141.96s)]
*  Dark day well, uh historic historic day. Yeah, one of one of many we've been covering recently. Well, i'm very glad [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2146.44s)]
*  That we decided to do this. I had no idea how horrendous it was going to be but great to get to talk to you ben [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2153.72s)]
*  I thought we'd be talking about like a rare earths agreement. I know I did too [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2158.92s)]
*  Trying to explain why that was important. But uh, thanks for watching this youtube exclusive [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2162.12s)]
*  You [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNiLeKoq-o0&t=2175.48s)]
