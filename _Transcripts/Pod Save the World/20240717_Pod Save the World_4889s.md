Video Description: Tommy Vietor and Ben Rhodes discuss the global reaction to the assassination attempt on Donald Trump and the rise of political violence around the world, Trump VP pick JD Vance’s views on foreign policy, and more low-lights from the RNC. They also talk about the conviction of Senator Robert Menendez on corruption charges, the last news from Gaza, Robert Kagame’s re-election in Rwanda, Kenya’s ongoing protests, a win for women’s rights activists in Gambia, the world’s most expensive wedding in India, and arguably one of the most tone-deaf social media posts in history. Then, Tommy speaks with Congressman Seth Moulton about JD Vance, calls for Biden to step down, Secret Service’s failures, and what the IDF could learn from the US war in Iraq.

# The World Reacts to Donald Trump’s Attempted Assassination
**Pod Save the World:** [July 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0)
*  Welcome to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Ben Rhodes. Slow Newsweek. I can't keep up. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean things that seemed absolutely transitional and existential like three weeks ago are now like [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=6.16s)]
*  you know when you guys said on PSA that Trump was convicted of 34 felonies what like a few weeks ago [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=12.08s)]
*  it feels like it was about 10 years ago. I thought the debate was like the end of the world [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=17.92s)]
*  and then Saturday was the most terrifying shocking thing I've ever witnessed on basically live TV. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=22.32s)]
*  I learned from you right so I was like I was with my family at lunch and I get this text like that [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=28.16s)]
*  was bad and I was like oh no Biden had another brain freeze or something and then I clicked on [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=33.12s)]
*  the link and they're like oh no much worse yeah much much worse. Yeah you know so I was home with [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=38.32s)]
*  with James or two month old just like watching the news basically watch this all unfold live. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=43.04s)]
*  It's horrifying. We're going to talk about all of this Ben so we're going to talk about the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=48.32s)]
*  international reaction to the attempted assassination of President Trump. We'll talk [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=52.16s)]
*  about vice presidential nominee JD Vance and his foreign policy positions and record. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=56.72s)]
*  Some lowlights from the Republican convention an update on our good friend dear friend of the pod [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=62.4s)]
*  Senator Bob Menendez who's been in court a bit lately. The latest from Gaza an election in Rwanda [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=67.52s)]
*  a protest movement in Kenya some good news out of Gambia and then some fun stories to close [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=74.64s)]
*  and then Ben I just spoke with Congressman Seth Moulton from Massachusetts. I believe you know well. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=79.28s)]
*  Yes yeah great guy very good guy. So if you don't know Seth Moulton you know he's a member [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=84.16s)]
*  of Congress now he also went to Harvard he also served four tours in Iraq. It's really interesting [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=89.6s)]
*  background and resume. The reason I want to talk to him was because in mid-October of last year [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=94.8s)]
*  right after the October 7 attacks he wrote this op-ed about the lessons from Iraq and Afghanistan [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  and all the mistakes the Israelis should not repeat in their ground invasion into Gaza. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=108.64s)]
*  And I reread it this week and it was prescient. So we talked about that you know what the path [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=114.16s)]
*  forward looks like and we also talked about JD Vance his record the NATO summit a bit and then [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=120.48s)]
*  Seth Moulton is one of a handful of members of Congress who have said that President Biden [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=127.28s)]
*  should step down and let a new generation run against President Trump. So we also talked about [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=130.8s)]
*  that. Yeah I can't wait to hear that. I mean he's the thing about Seth Moulton is he always says [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=135.6s)]
*  exactly what's on his mind. He does not pull punches and you know not always easy to pin down [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=141.2s)]
*  on the ideological spectrum. He's a pragmatist in the best sense of the word. Yeah I think like [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=146.39999999999998s)]
*  we always talk about how our goal for all shows on the Crooked Network is to make the on mic [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=151.6s)]
*  conversation as close to the text chain as you possibly can knowing that the text chains can be [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=157.83999999999997s)]
*  a little meaner and a little nastier. Seth Moulton is not mean or nasty on mic or in the text chain [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=164.16s)]
*  he's just honest on both. It's like a it's the Venn diagram is a circle so definitely check that [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=169.2s)]
*  out. But his message basically was to what's annoying about what's happening in Washington [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=174.39999999999998s)]
*  right now and I respect people who think Joe Biden is gives us our best chance to win. I respect [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  people who disagree. I happen to disagree with that. Yes. But what I don't respect is the people [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=183.83999999999997s)]
*  who privately wring their hands about Joe Biden's candidacy and then publicly say nothing. Yeah I [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=188.16s)]
*  mean what's the point of being in politics if that's going to be your approach to things you [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=195.92s)]
*  know. And especially when the stakes are this high it seems like that would be a time to actually [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  say what you think instead of just unburdening yourself to Axios or something. Right like what [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=206.56s)]
*  will feel worse saying something honest now and getting mean tweets or saying it the day after [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=211.67999999999998s)]
*  the election. Yeah and you know the thing that's bothering me about this Tommy just to go on this [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=218.16s)]
*  quick detour is it's that you know the small D Democratic Party and this impulse to shut down [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=222.8s)]
*  any debate or discussion kind of cuts against exactly what the Democratic Party is supposed to [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=231.84s)]
*  be and certainly cuts against the model that you want to set against an autocrat an actual autocrat [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=237.04000000000002s)]
*  like Trump you know. So it's been really disappointing to see some people try to shut down voices like [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=242.8s)]
*  Seth Moulton's or anybody's frankly and you know some of us here at Cricket Media because [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=250.32s)]
*  you're just turning into the thing that you are supposed to be running against. And I really think [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=257.2s)]
*  when you tell people not to say what they think or that they're not allowed to say what they think [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=262.24s)]
*  I think it builds resentment in a way that could be super toxic and when you're trying to build a [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=267.03999999999996s)]
*  tent over a party that is this like motley coalition of very different people with different views [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=272.64s)]
*  telling a bunch of them to shut up is not going to work. Yeah and telling people to kind of [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=277.84s)]
*  not pay attention to something that they can see you know like you and I were in communications [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=282.47999999999996s)]
*  like the worst place to be is to be denying something that is evident to people and that's [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=286.88s)]
*  kind of where we are in some of these discussions. Well more of this in the interview but Ben let's [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=293.52s)]
*  let's start with the biggest news in the world today which is you know the attempt on former [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=298.88s)]
*  President Trump's life at a rally in Pennsylvania. So as everyone listening probably knows this [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=303.76s)]
*  shooter only grazed Trump's ear but he did kill a rally attendee and father of two named Corey [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=307.68s)]
*  Campertore. The shooter was a 20 year old Pennsylvania man I'm not going to say his name [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=314.16s)]
*  because fuck him. It's not clear what his motive is or was but the FBI is now going through his [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=318.72s)]
*  phone looking for clues. Leaders around the world quickly denounced political violence. Some of [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=323.92s)]
*  Trump's closest international allies and partners expressed sympathies and then America's adversaries [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=329.68s)]
*  jumped on this story and made it part of their propaganda. In Russia state media outlets and [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=336.24s)]
*  various Putin propagandists started pushing the narrative that the Democratic party was behind the [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=341.12s)]
*  assassination attempt. Some suggested that the Ukrainian military was involved. Points for [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=345.68s)]
*  creativity there I guess. CNN reported that Chinese state-run media outlets of the shooting [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=350.72s)]
*  was the result of the chaos and dysfunction that comes from democracy. So they've got one note. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=356.16s)]
*  Standard line. Just apply that no matter what the circumstances. Rinse repeat. So there's a lot of [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=361.6s)]
*  different angles we could discuss on this story. This is obviously a shocking failure by Secret [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=366.88000000000005s)]
*  Service. I talk about this with Seth Moulton too. There's likely going to be a bunch of investigations [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=371.52000000000004s)]
*  into the security lapses. Frankly if I was Joe Biden I'd be firing someone today and not waiting [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=376.16s)]
*  for those investigations. But there's also been this feeling that political violence is on the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=381.2s)]
*  rise globally. You and I have talked about for example political assassinations or assassination [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=387.68s)]
*  attempts by the Indian government even in the United States and Canada. You raise this broader [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=393.76s)]
*  sense of this growing political violence. Why do you think that's happening? Yeah I've been thinking [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=399.44s)]
*  about this. If you just consider the last year or two you had Shinzo Abe the foreign prime minister [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=404.24s)]
*  of Japan killed in Japan. We just had this near assassination of the prime minister of Slovakia. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=410.48s)]
*  Imran Khan was targeted for assassination in Pakistan. Bolsonaro was stabbed in Brazil. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=416.32s)]
*  You've had other attempts in Latin America. In the UK two members of parliament have been killed [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=424.24s)]
*  in recent years. And so there's something there. I mean that's anecdotal but you can kind of feel [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=430.48s)]
*  the temperature rising to use a probably an overused metaphor. And here's what I think is [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=437.2s)]
*  going on. One there's this kind of sense in lots of parts of the world that the stakes are like [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=442.32s)]
*  really high in politics right now. It was absolute. And I've been for this book I'm working on I was [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=450.4s)]
*  just kind of in the 60s here and it was amazing to relive horrible the Kennedy King and Kennedy [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=456.24s)]
*  assassinations. But that too was a time when it felt like the stakes were incredibly high. The [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=463.12s)]
*  issues mattered a lot but identity was also in play. You know the country's changing in some way. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=468.24s)]
*  What it means to be Americans at stake. You know civil rights, diversity. This is 63 to 60. I [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=474.4s)]
*  always think about what it must have been like to live in those years. Just terrifying. And to just [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=481.28000000000003s)]
*  see one hero after another taken away. And right now I think we're just in this period where the [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=485.52s)]
*  stakes feel incredibly high. That to me is like the first point. And the kind of related point is [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=490.88s)]
*  that the stakes are high and also like there's a real collapse in confidence in like institutions [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=497.52s)]
*  and leadership. Right. So it's like there's a sense that like we're being let down by all these [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=504.15999999999997s)]
*  people. You know and obviously this takes it to the most extreme when an individual decides to do [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=509.68s)]
*  something horrific like this. But it does feel like this is going to be with us for a period of time [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=514.96s)]
*  through which the stakes are high. People are really angry. They're angry at establishments [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=520.24s)]
*  and elites. They're sensing that their own identity is somehow threatened. It's a troubling trend [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=526.4s)]
*  because these things tend to I mean not to be a Cassandra here but these things tend to kind of [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=533.28s)]
*  repeat themselves. This is one reason to get to the bottom secret service. Like because I actually [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=539.2s)]
*  think this is not the last time we're going to see something attempted either here or in other [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=543.12s)]
*  prominent countries. Yeah it's also why like no one should ever cheer for political violence no [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=548.4s)]
*  matter whether it's your opponent or you know your worst enemy gets killed. You should not be in [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=553.12s)]
*  favor of that because political violence once it starts tends to get out of control quickly and [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=557.28s)]
*  can't be stopped and someone who is your neighbor could be attacking you the next day. I mean you [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=562.8s)]
*  hear about this constantly. We shall also mention then that CNN reported that U.S. authorities [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=566.7199999999999s)]
*  recently obtained intelligence from a human source about an Iranian plot to assassinate Donald Trump. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=572.3199999999999s)]
*  That according to CNN led to secret service increasing security around him in the last few [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=577.9200000000001s)]
*  weeks. There's no evidence of a foreign connection to what happened in Pennsylvania. I highly doubt [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=583.2800000000001s)]
*  one will be found. The odds of you know the IRGC linking up with this random kid and like sending [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=589.76s)]
*  him to Walmart to buy 50 bullets right before this it feels very low. But it does raise even more [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=595.12s)]
*  questions about the lack of security and just like stepping back I mean the Iranians there's been [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=599.9200000000001s)]
*  bunch of reports that the Iranians have wanted to retaliate against Trump officials like John Bolton [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=605.36s)]
*  or Mike Pompeo because of the Qasem Soleimani assassination. What was that 2020? Yeah so it [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=610.48s)]
*  probably revolves around that but notable. Yeah I'd say on the Iranian angle you know what I [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=615.2s)]
*  think that is and obviously I don't know but is it like because Qasem Soleimani was assassinated [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=621.6s)]
*  and he you know he was the leader of the IRGC it's kind of iconic figure in the Iranian system. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=628.32s)]
*  I'm sure that there are people in the IRGC who sit around and talk to each other about like we [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=633.6s)]
*  got to get them back we got to take out Trump we got to take out Pompeo and the intelligence [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=639.12s)]
*  report could just pick that kind of chatter up or this it says human intelligence that's one guy [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=643.36s)]
*  being like hey I heard some IRGC guys saying they'd like to I say that not to minimize it but just [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=647.84s)]
*  there's a there's a way in which you could get that reporting and it not be like a specific [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=653.76s)]
*  threat like a specific Iranian plot and it certainly doesn't feel like yeah this this guy [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=658.4s)]
*  random 20 year old in Pennsylvania was connected to that but it does you know again raise these [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=664.0s)]
*  questions about Secret Service and you know particularly a campaign season is the hardest [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=668.4s)]
*  time for Secret Service because they're the least controlled events right so like most you were in [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=673.04s)]
*  the White House like most of the time you're going to an indoor venue with the president a very [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=677.68s)]
*  controlled venue a venue you've been kind of looking at for a while Secret Service sends an [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=682.56s)]
*  advanced team not the kind of big outdoor crowd venues or the kind of OTR off the record dropped [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=687.2s)]
*  by a diner kind of venues and so one thing you know not that either Joe Biden or Donald Trump [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=694.0s)]
*  or that active campaigners but but it does I think raise the the bar significantly for the kinds of [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=700.32s)]
*  events and campaigning that we'll see this year I think yeah and it's just scary and like my god [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=707.5200000000001s)]
*  why would you run for president if you thought that this kind of violence was a possibility and [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=711.9200000000001s)]
*  the truth is like there's a lot of like incredibly brave talented people in the Secret Service the [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=716.48s)]
*  people around the president are incredible and you know literally put their lives on the line [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=721.52s)]
*  to protect the principle but the organization itself has had a lot of problems and the truth [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=726.64s)]
*  is I think with a lot with any like situation like this where you're going out in public [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=733.04s)]
*  if someone is willing to die in the course of trying to assassinate a political figure like [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=738.0s)]
*  they've got to leg up in that situation you know what I mean yeah like so that's a real risk here [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=744.48s)]
*  yeah the the you know I had the same experience and feeling about Secret Service which is like [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=750.0799999999999s)]
*  I liked a lot of the individuals you know that we met they were on the presidential detail or [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=754.96s)]
*  they worked around the White House but I had serious questions about the institution itself [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=759.36s)]
*  because it's kind of this weird it's under the umbrella of the Department of Homeland Security [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=763.28s)]
*  which is kind of weird and but it has very much its own opaque culture and protocols and you know [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=767.52s)]
*  ways of plugging into the White House plugging into kind of state and local authorities that [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=776.0s)]
*  apply supply a lot of the manpower at these events but they're kind of a bit immune to criticism like [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=779.76s)]
*  you were you were gone by the second term when we had a bunch of scandals at the Secret Service [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=786.72s)]
*  do you remember this in the later Obama years I was there for when when there's a huge scandal [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=790.88s)]
*  around the Secret Service hiring sex workers on a presidential trip okay oh yeah so I remember I was [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=795.04s)]
*  at a dinner with like eight reporters and the AP reporter was texting me across the table like hey [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=801.12s)]
*  we just got this tip and I'm like no way that's true that's impossible and then the whole thing [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=807.52s)]
*  unfolded we're Cartagena I think yeah no I mean they were hiring sex workers I mean the funny [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=811.8399999999999s)]
*  thing about it is it's not that funny but you were kind of reluctant to criticize them you know [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=816.0s)]
*  because you know what I mean like it's a weird thing for Biden right now right yeah that's exactly [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=822.4000000000001s)]
*  that's his detail but he's got to criticize their the handling of what happened on Saturday that's [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=826.08s)]
*  right when we had a bunch of these things it was very hard for the spokespeople because you like [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=831.12s)]
*  were even the Trump people you see or go out of their way to defend all the agents and before [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=836.88s)]
*  they say that they have questions I mean so it's a weird when you're literally talking about an [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=841.6s)]
*  institution dedicated to keeping your principal alive you know you kind of pull your punches a [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=845.6800000000001s)]
*  little bit and that that has put them a little bit beyond accountability yeah it's not great if [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=851.28s)]
*  you happen to be in Wisconsin come see us we Pod Save America is on tour this Friday July 19th [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=856.56s)]
*  we got Ben Wickler co-host Aaron Haynes and then on the 20th Love It or Leave It is also in Madison, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=862.8s)]
*  Wisconsin great shows go to crooked.com events to get tickets the other huge news this week Ben [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=868.3199999999999s)]
*  is that Trump picked Ohio Senator JD Vance to be his running mate Vance is only 39 years old which [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=874.3199999999999s)]
*  pisses me off to no end I know he served for you thank you for tapping into my midlife crisis [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=880.4s)]
*  of course I'm right there with you he served four years in the Marine Corps he became famous after [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=885.76s)]
*  publishing his memoir the Hillbilly Elegy for those unfamiliar with JD Vance I think the best [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=890.64s)]
*  way to understand him is he is a guy who is all in on the economic populism part of the MAGA [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=895.28s)]
*  movement he's anti-trade and pro-tariff he's nativist and anti-immigrant his selection is [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=901.28s)]
*  just a big middle finger to like Paul Ryan and all those free market conservatives he's also more [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=907.6s)]
*  isolationist when it comes to foreign policy in a recent New York Times interview Vance said that [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=913.9200000000001s)]
*  Trump was the only candidate who had litigated the mistakes of George W Bush in the Iraq war [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=918.16s)]
*  Barack Obama would beg to differ and he said that in their first conversation I think in 2021 [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=923.76s)]
*  Trump complained to JD about military leaders kind of monkeying around with troop redeployment timing [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=929.0400000000001s)]
*  to avoid actually following Trump's order to bring the troops home from places like Syria which is [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=935.44s)]
*  interesting that they talked about that Vance has also had a lot to say about Ukraine here's a clip [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=941.2800000000001s)]
*  you need to articulate what the ambition is what is 61 billion dollars going to accomplish [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=946.6400000000001s)]
*  that 100 billion dollars hasn't we should remember Jake Ukraine is functionally destroyed as a country [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=951.6800000000001s)]
*  the average age of a soldier in the Ukrainian army right now is 43 that's tragic that's older than me [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=957.6800000000001s)]
*  I'm 39 if this thing goes on a little bit longer the average age of a Ukrainian soldier is going [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=962.8s)]
*  to be older than you and then a year later it could be a wolf blitzer that is a tragedy what [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=968.16s)]
*  does it look like I don't like this age graph I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm 54 for those wondering I [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=972.88s)]
*  we're getting to a place where we're going to be functionally on the hook to pay for Ukrainian [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=978.16s)]
*  pensioners to rebuild the entire country we need to bring the killing to a stop and that's what [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=984.56s)]
*  American leadership should be doing not writing more blank checks to the war Jake Tapper finds [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=990.08s)]
*  JD Vance's age annoying too yeah very self-interested take from Jake uh Ben uh I bet a lot of what Vance [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=994.64s)]
*  was saying there sounds pretty reasonable to a lot of people I mean myself included at times yeah I [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1001.12s)]
*  think the first thing I'd say is that you know sometimes you know when I talk to people they [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1007.76s)]
*  assume that the second Trump term might not be that bad I think what the JD Vance pick demonstrates [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1012.96s)]
*  is we have been correct in asserting that what's going to be different is the ideologues are going [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1018.8000000000001s)]
*  to be there from the beginning right so you know Mike Pence conventional republican Rex Tillerson [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1024.88s)]
*  Jim Mattis like in the national security and foreign policy space the pick of JD Vance signals [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1030.16s)]
*  this is going to be the true believer maga types from get-go right so there's not gonna be forms [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1035.3600000000001s)]
*  if Marco Rubio had been vice president you know you could have seen the form shopping that other [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1040.96s)]
*  countries would say oh I'll go to the neocon guy for the thing I need I think for the national [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1044.96s)]
*  security you know community types uh who rightly point out that JD Vance you know wants to cut off [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1049.6000000000001s)]
*  Ukraine and you just made the point very well which is that don't dismiss that argument he just [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1056.72s)]
*  made don't just kind of look I think it'd be tragic to cut Ukraine off um but to just kind of think [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1063.28s)]
*  that it's a political winner and that you can say oh this guy's a big problem because he wants [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1070.0s)]
*  to cut off Ukraine no like that that argument I mean the funny thing about JD Vance is he was [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1075.44s)]
*  making a pretty cogent informed intelligent argument until he had to revert to trolling [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1080.0s)]
*  and made the comment about Jake and Wolf Blitzer weirdly yeah um but the basic point of like well [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1085.44s)]
*  wait a second we're spending 60 billion dollars a year and the front line's not changing and [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1090.16s)]
*  that's not helping the Ukrainians because they're dying anyway so why shouldn't we just end this war [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1094.32s)]
*  I think there's a good argument you made against that about a values-based argument not cutting [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1098.64s)]
*  off Ukraine um a allies argument about you know the United States needing to kind of hold together [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1103.8400000000001s)]
*  this coalition but more importantly like a end the war argument right which is that if you want [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1111.8400000000001s)]
*  there to be a negotiated settlement that doesn't totally you know ignore all of Ukraine's interests [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1117.76s)]
*  Ukraine needs to continue to get support so that you can have a good negotiation right and I know [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1123.52s)]
*  that's a bit of a bank shot but the point is that no everybody wants to end the war you know that's [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1129.2s)]
*  like the objective should be trying to do that in the best possible terms for Ukraine not saying [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1135.04s)]
*  you know the as long as it takes message may be a good one at the NATO summit but politically in [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1141.2s)]
*  this country I think just saying we're going to do whatever it takes for Ukraine as long as it takes [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1147.04s)]
*  I don't think that's a good political message talk to anyone who has done [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1151.0400000000002s)]
*  focus groups for polling especially of younger voters of all races they think it is crazy that [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1155.44s)]
*  we are sending 60 billion dollars to a foreign country for a war period without knowing any of [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1161.68s)]
*  the context. By the way they're open to the same argument in Israel too. Yeah oh absolutely they [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1167.6000000000001s)]
*  agree with Gaza as well JD Vance has said some really shitty things at one point he said to Steve [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1171.6000000000001s)]
*  Bannon I got to be honest with you I don't really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1176.64s)]
*  that is callous and disgusting and just like dehumanizing but his broader point is basically [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1180.88s)]
*  like he doesn't he says and if we take him at you know face value he says he doesn't want to [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1186.0s)]
*  abandon Ukraine but he thinks that our leverage comes from the fact that ultimately Russia cannot [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1191.2s)]
*  occupy all of Ukraine because it would take too many troops and that the way they've shifted their [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1196.5600000000002s)]
*  economy to be just a wartime economy will have repercussions in the long run because it will just [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1201.6s)]
*  not serve anyone else so he basically thinks you need to cut a deal that says Ukraine will not be [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1206.8s)]
*  in NATO and that freezes the lines of the war where there are now there's a lot of holes in [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1212.48s)]
*  that argument like you have to trust Putin to live up to that deal but I bet a lot to the average [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1218.56s)]
*  kind of voter even well-informed ones they might think that makes sense to me. Yeah and I think [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1224.8799999999999s)]
*  I made the argument about you need to fortify the Ukrainians to get them a better deal but also [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1230.0800000000002s)]
*  you got to bring the Ukrainians into a deal so one another thing that D.A.D. Vance is wrong about [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1235.52s)]
*  beyond just being sounding like an asshole when it comes to the interests of the Ukrainians but the [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1240.0800000000002s)]
*  other thing he's wrong about is that there's not a foregone conclusion that they will sign the terms [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1245.1200000000001s)]
*  of an agreement so you have to show them hey you're going to be in the European Union you're going [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1249.76s)]
*  to have security guarantees you know because they're going to have to swell the very hard pill of [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1254.8000000000002s)]
*  freezing this conflict with a lot of territory occupied by Russia and so to bring them along [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1259.6s)]
*  you know the J.D. Vance thing it's like pap you can in foreign policy it's like it taps into [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1264.9599999999998s)]
*  populism but it's not like practical in the world you know now politically that's not an argument [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1270.48s)]
*  a lot of people are just gonna like how it sounds but I think you have to reframe the support for [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1277.12s)]
*  Ukraine as trying to get them in the best position and the war not as this open-ended thing. Yeah I [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1282.8s)]
*  mean J.D. Vance talks about Ukraine handing over what 17, 18 percent of the country to the Russians [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1288.24s)]
*  after you know parts of Ukraine that were occupied by Russia were you know the just crime scenes I [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1296.0s)]
*  mean the war crimes left and right people tortured people executed and murdered he talks about it [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1302.4s)]
*  like it's a simple thing with like global chess pieces that you're pushing around he sort of [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1306.24s)]
*  loses the humanity but yeah I worry about the politics of it. Vance also dabbles in a little [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1310.4s)]
*  Islamophobia and he seems to like offending our closest allies here's another clip. By the way I [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1316.64s)]
*  have to beat up on the UK just one one additional thing I was talking with a friend recently [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1322.24s)]
*  and we were talking about you know one of the big dangers in the world of course is nuclear [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1327.68s)]
*  proliferation though of course the Biden administration doesn't care about it and I was [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1332.64s)]
*  talking about you know what is the first truly Islamist country that will get a nuclear weapon [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1336.72s)]
*  and we were like maybe it's Iran you know maybe Pakistan already kind of counts and then we sort [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1342.56s)]
*  of finally decided maybe it's actually the UK since labor just took over. Noted Islamist [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1346.96s)]
*  Keir Stormer. I mean that was like a that was recent too that was like obviously after the [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1352.48s)]
*  labor election it's like what do you Keir Stormer or what is he talking about like [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1357.28s)]
*  swerve to Islamophobia. Is that like some weird you know the the anti-woke brigades in in MAGA [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1361.92s)]
*  like J.D. Vance have always hated Sadiq Khan the mayor of London so I didn't know if he was like [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1368.24s)]
*  the Sadiq Khan of an army. Never mind by the way like Pakistan does have a nuclear weapon and [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1372.8000000000002s)]
*  they're an Islamic state but put that aside. I mean I think the the bigger challenge for J.D. Vance [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1378.4s)]
*  is just that one he comes across like a kind of a jerk and so does Trump but with Trump it's kind [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1383.6000000000001s)]
*  of fun with J.D. Vance is just kind of mean you know it's like why is this he's taking shots at [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1390.64s)]
*  the UK and also his coziness with the global far right to me is truly worrisome because [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1395.2800000000002s)]
*  we've talked a lot about this connective tissue between like Orban and and Bolsonaro and people [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1402.16s)]
*  like that. J.D. Vance is like right in that mix. Well let's hear J.D. Vance talking about your [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1407.76s)]
*  your favorite Victor Orban. Victor Orban in particular as you know I mean he rewrote the [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1412.8000000000002s)]
*  constitution he neutered the courts he has tried to control the media these are not necessarily [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1417.68s)]
*  conservative principles so why would you want to mimic him? Well look I'm not endorsing every [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1423.28s)]
*  single thing that Victor Orban has ever done. I don't know everything he's ever done what I [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1427.68s)]
*  do think is on the university on the university principle the idea that taxpayers should have some [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1431.28s)]
*  influence and how their money is spent at these universities it's a totally reasonable thing and [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1436.8s)]
*  I do think that he's made some smart decisions there that we could we could learn from the [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1440.8799999999999s)]
*  United States. Can you remind us what the context is here of this university issue? Yeah well first [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1444.16s)]
*  of all Victor Orban shut down a Soros funded university in Budapest which was like the you [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1448.72s)]
*  know the best university in Hungary they had to move it literally to another country you know [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1455.92s)]
*  and where J.D. Vance I think is totally off you know is it's not just about it's not just about [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1460.0s)]
*  like tax they weaponize this idea of anything that receives any kind of taxpayer funding in any [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1466.72s)]
*  fashion basically has to accord to Victor Orban's wishes. I mean the media is a good example of this [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1472.96s)]
*  like the biggest advertisers in a lot of Hungarian media was like the national [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1480.0s)]
*  like lottery or something you know and they withdrew all that ad money from media they [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1485.2800000000002s)]
*  didn't like you know so they they'd find these kind of back doors to kind of and then it got [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1491.0400000000002s)]
*  more and more you know aggressive but they'd find these back doors to kind of either compel [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1496.0s)]
*  certain media to say certain things or to kind of weaponize you know government resources [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1501.68s)]
*  essentially to favor certain media over others. I mean we may need to study this here cricket media [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1506.88s)]
*  yeah because he basically used tax laws to screw over media he didn't like or universities he [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1512.64s)]
*  didn't like and so what J.D. Vance is referring to is really authoritarian like shutting down [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1518.3200000000002s)]
*  universities shutting down media outlets and then you know picking winners with taxpayer dollars [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1524.8000000000002s)]
*  for ones that are on your agenda like that's that's literally what J.D. Vance is talking about [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1531.2s)]
*  and that is core authoritarian playbook stuff you know and and he's been swimming in these circles [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1536.48s)]
*  and going to these conferences and talking to these guys he knows more about what Victor Orban's [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1542.24s)]
*  done than than he let on there. Luckily we've we've politics proofed things here at crooked media by [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1546.0s)]
*  pissing off officials in both white houses we may be screwed we may be screwed in either outcome [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1551.52s)]
*  listen yeah bar is low yeah look I mean ultimately Ben I don't I don't know how much influence J.D. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1557.36s)]
*  Vance would have in a second Trump term on foreign policy I do know though that his selection [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1563.28s)]
*  leapfrogs all the free trade all the neocon types in the Republican Party Marco Rubio [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1568.8s)]
*  Ron DeSantis like all these guys who thought they were the heir apparent [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1574.8s)]
*  just took a big step back in line and that's you know worth noting and that's why I think it really [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1578.72s)]
*  matters not necessarily because of influence but because the message it sends that the Republican [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1583.2s)]
*  Party has this wing of neocons that have been kind of hanging on to their influence in different [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1588.0s)]
*  ways the kind of Lindsey Graham type Marco Rubio type approach what this kind of solidifies is no [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1592.32s)]
*  the future of the Republican Party foreign policy is isolationist it's autocratic it is against you [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1599.36s)]
*  know it's America first it's devoid of values it's very tariff based and protectionist you know [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1605.44s)]
*  very anti-trade no free trade agreements that kind of stuff so I think we're seeing the [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1612.0s)]
*  complete transformation of the Republican Party into this Trump version of America first foreign [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1619.04s)]
*  policy and and we can't kind of pretend like the other guys are going to come back you know [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1623.9199999999998s)]
*  whether you like that or not I think those other guys are you know on a shrinking island [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1628.8799999999999s)]
*  yeah it's like Paul Ryan just sort of like by himself in a think tank so to the Republican [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1633.2s)]
*  Convention I mean most of the news yesterday at the RNC was the VP selection the reveal of Trump's [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1639.28s)]
*  ear bandage but we did want to highlight one speaker because we are deeply petty people at [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1645.44s)]
*  the end of the day here's a clip of tech douche and wannabe Twitter Secretary of State David Sachs [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1651.04s)]
*  killing all of the energy in the room at the RNC then he provoked yes provoked the Russians [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1658.3200000000002s)]
*  to invade Ukraine with talk of NATO expansion [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1666.24s)]
*  afterward he rejected every opportunity for peace in Ukraine including a deal to end the war [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1676.0s)]
*  just two months after it broke out stirring yeah the best thing about that is this guy for those [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1683.36s)]
*  of you who don't follow us right he's this tech bro PayPal you know rich guy who you you unfortunately [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1690.24s)]
*  don't erase his time as Xenefits well you you drew my attention to this all-in pod a couple of years [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1697.68s)]
*  ago and and because you were fighting with another guy yeah yeah he said he didn't he said that caring [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1703.44s)]
*  about the the Uyghur genocide was below his line that's right that's his co-host and then we had [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1708.8s)]
*  David Sachs at Twitter with Elon Musk right after he bought it you know thinking he's some big tech [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1715.36s)]
*  media executive but my favorite thing about that speech and I'll say this as a self-important [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1720.0s)]
*  podcaster my favorite thing about that speech is it's a classic example of like a podcaster's like [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1723.68s)]
*  you know what I could do I could get up in front of a political convention and say what I say in [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1728.48s)]
*  my podcast and everyone would applaud wow him yeah wow my Ukraine takes what I say to Chanov [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1733.04s)]
*  you know at the all-in studio is gonna like kill at the convention it's actually absolutely gonna [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1738.8799999999999s)]
*  slay and and no it turns out this guy has no qualification to be a politician a political [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1743.6s)]
*  figure the only reason he has a speaking slot is he's probably pledged money he's rich million [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1748.8799999999999s)]
*  dollars to some super PAC you know he probably went into the convention harboring dreams of [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1753.76s)]
*  being like I don't know the secretary of commerce or something drafted to run for the senate yeah [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1758.8s)]
*  and he came out of there you know never gonna get an appointment to anything so it was enjoyable [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1763.6s)]
*  yeah no he definitely has done the this is a little fantasy is equivalent of me like [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1767.76s)]
*  imagining I go see a band and they're like can anyone play guitar you get called on stage and [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1772.24s)]
*  he's do a face melting solo for him it was you know a little speech of six minutes speech about [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1776.32s)]
*  abandoning Ukraine I think you sent me the blog item that was like everyone's now talking to each [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1781.1200000000001s)]
*  other over him and quietly booing so anyway uh Ben as long as we're kind of in our petty section [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1786.0s)]
*  and talking about enemies of the pod let's talk about uh senator Bob Menendez democrat from New [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1792.64s)]
*  Jersey he's had a corruption trial so on Tuesday Menendez was found guilty on all 16 counts that [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1797.76s)]
*  included bribery fraud and acting as a foreign agent on behalf of Egypt and obstruction as [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1804.4s)]
*  listeners may recall prosecutors said Menendez took bribes worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1810.16s)]
*  the form of gold bars cash and even a mercedes while he was the democrat leader on the house [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1814.96s)]
*  uh while he was a democratic leader on the senate foreign relations committee [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1820.16s)]
*  he did this in exchange for basically doing political favors for the Egyptians his wife [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1823.92s)]
*  is also on trial but that has been postponed because she's undergoing breast cancer treatment [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1829.44s)]
*  so Menendez's sentencing is scheduled for October 29th and he has now made history as the first [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1833.84s)]
*  senator in US history to be charged as a foreign agent earlier today uh senate majority leader [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1839.28s)]
*  Chuck Schumer said quote in light of this guilty verdict senator Menendez must now do what it's [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1844.16s)]
*  right for his constituents the senate in our country and resign amen to that chuck yeah well [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1848.4s)]
*  i mean with all due respect and i do respect Chuck Schumer a lot like uh [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1855.68s)]
*  you probably should have done that a while ago um but look i mean this the deliberations i [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1861.3600000000001s)]
*  noticed took less than the closing arguments i mean this was not a hard case to crack [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1868.0s)]
*  gold bars in your in your closet yeah not subtle but like the point is this guy has always been [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1872.56s)]
*  fundamentally corrupt and we've talked about the kind of impact he's had i mean this does [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1878.32s)]
*  in terms of latin america policy i think you know he was the biggest impediment to changing [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=1884.3999999999999s)]

*  long-term military campaign against israel and is known for deploying suicide bombers and prioritizing [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2040.4s)]
*  the kidnapping of israeli soldiers so very bad very bad guy he's also believed to be a key architect [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2046.5600000000002s)]
*  of the october 7th attacks um it is still not clear if this strike killed him uh but there are [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2052.1600000000003s)]
*  reports that israel uh did their best they used five two thousand pound bombs in that strike there's [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2059.44s)]
*  other news reports including one of the new york times that describe it as five quote u.s made [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2066.08s)]
*  precision guided bombs but they dropped an unbelievable amount of ordinance in an area [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2071.12s)]
*  that israel had designated as a humanitarian zone and according to the gaza health ministry [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2077.04s)]
*  these airstrikes killed 90 people and 300 were wounded including a bunch of kids so just horrific [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2082.7999999999997s)]
*  civilian toll from this strike um last week at his post-nato press conference president biden [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2089.2s)]
*  seemed confident that a ceasefire deal between hamas and israel was imminent but unfortunately [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2095.12s)]
*  once again it still is not materialized uh prime minister netanyahu is in dc a week from the release [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2100.64s)]
*  of this episode according to several israeli press outlets uh over the weekend he spent a couple [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2107.44s)]
*  hours at his weekly cabinet meeting talking about the attempted assassination of donald trump [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2113.92s)]
*  and then complaining about incitement against him which many news outlets think is basically [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2118.64s)]
*  a pretext to get his attorney general to shut down protests so it's just you know there's no [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2124.48s)]
*  good news coming out of gaza bin yeah it's it's it's kind of awful how status quo this all feels [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2130.0s)]
*  and and and it you know with everything else that's happening this kind of slips from the [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2136.96s)]
*  front burner of attention on muhammad i mean bad guy um absolutely in the leadership of hamas [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2141.12s)]
*  and you know in any read of kind of international law would totally be a legitimate target right [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2150.32s)]
*  but the problem is there's not uh like a terrorist in the world that you should [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2158.72s)]
*  kill that many civilians to take out i mean i've said this before in this podcast like one of the [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2164.0s)]
*  considerations that obama had in sending a navy seal team in to get bin laden [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2168.96s)]
*  is if we blew up that compound it would kill like 15 people and and that was bin laden's family and [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2172.72s)]
*  i mean so you say what you will about the u.s but the idea that that's an acceptable level of [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2178.64s)]
*  civilian casualties it just shows you kind of what's wrong with the whole mentality that just [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2184.0s)]
*  completely devalues palestinian civilian life and international law because to say that it's [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2188.64s)]
*  acceptable to drop five two thousand pound bombs on a lot of civilians because you think this guy [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2195.2799999999997s)]
*  might be there is just it's the wrong mentality is what we've seen throughout this this war [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2200.48s)]
*  yeah well just to add to that i mean later in the show i talked with seth moulton who reminded me of [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2205.84s)]
*  general stan mccrystal's insurgent math stan mccrystal who was like the head of joint special [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2210.8s)]
*  operations command right like a one of the bigger badasses the u.s military is is cranked out he [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2216.08s)]
*  always he found that for every one innocent person you kill you create 10 new enemies that was his [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2221.52s)]
*  math coming out of iraq and afghanistan so if you have airstrikes where you're killing you know [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2228.32s)]
*  hundreds of innocent people to go after one senior hamas leader that math does not [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2233.44s)]
*  it does not make you safer in the long run yeah you're not thinking about [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2240.96s)]
*  the you know dignity of civilian life you're not thinking about international opinion you're not [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2244.2400000000002s)]
*  thinking about the long-term circumstance in gaza and whether this helps make that better you're [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2249.52s)]
*  kind of just thinking about vengeance in a way i mean it relates to the ceasefire piece because [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2255.04s)]
*  you know faced with the reality that they're not going to quote unquote destroy hamas you can see [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2260.72s)]
*  probably these really leadership thinking well what could we do that can allow us to declare victory [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2268.72s)]
*  and that's basically killing this guy and then sinwar the leader of hamas and so maybe really [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2273.9199999999996s)]
*  opening up the aperture in that regard i mean i but the ceasefire the body language administration [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2279.9199999999996s)]
*  was incredibly confident if not certain that there was going to be ceasefire that it had been [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2285.04s)]
*  agreed to as my read to fully agreed to right and biden kind of teed that up at the press conference [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2289.68s)]
*  after nato and i so i for the first time in a while i actually expected something to be announced [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2295.44s)]
*  but it feels like bb always scuttles it at the end you know and that that whatever you know some [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2301.68s)]
*  negotiators may get together and agree to something but when it comes up to bb it just gets killed or [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2306.7999999999997s)]
*  maybe it goes to cinema too and gets parked there so i don't know where we are on this you know and [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2311.68s)]
*  and that your point about bb too it's another thing about this era of assassination which is [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2317.68s)]
*  this environment can become a pretext for a lot of undemocratic shit you know i mean we talked about [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2325.68s)]
*  the need for a better secret service protection but you know it can become the the means for [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2331.04s)]
*  shutting down protests shutting down dissent that might be unfortunately a ramification of what we've [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2334.72s)]
*  been seeing yeah president biden you know gaza as we've talked about for months has been a big [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2341.04s)]
*  issue on the campaign trail for president biden he was asked about his gaza policy in a recent [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2347.6s)]
*  interview with complex magazine here's a clip you don't have to be a jew to be a zionist and the [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2352.72s)]
*  zionist is about whether or not israel is a safe haven for jews because of their history of how [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2358.48s)]
*  are you a zionist yes now that you'll be able to make a lot of that because people don't know [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2364.88s)]
*  what a zionist is do you know what a zionist is i just ask questions i don't answer by the way i'm [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2371.92s)]
*  the guy that did more for the palestinian community anybody i'm the guy that opened up all the assets [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2379.6s)]
*  i'm the guy that made sure that i got the egyptians open the border to let good goods do [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2384.56s)]
*  i wish he just explained what a zionist is to the interviewer rather than pop quiz him and i you [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2389.92s)]
*  know i think the part of the end that you've done more for the palestinians is probably not [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2395.04s)]
*  it's not going to read as credible to i think most of the audience listening which is you know [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2399.12s)]
*  young people yeah i mean i'm going to frame this as constructive criticism and not just criticism [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2403.52s)]
*  and and i want to say to listeners as as you know you said before and you said in psa like people [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2409.76s)]
*  who deeply believe in joe biden believe he should be our nominee that would totally respect that [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2415.28s)]
*  view you know people can have different views about that but what we all should want right is [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2421.84s)]
*  for the democratic nominee to win right so i'm going to frame it in this way like one if part [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2426.96s)]
*  of what you're trying to do is appeal to younger constituencies that's why i did that interview [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2434.0s)]
*  right um the and and speak to constituencies alienated by your gaza policy one you're not [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2438.72s)]
*  going to convince them that you've done a lot for the palestinian people right like to get it getting [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2446.0s)]
*  defensive like that you you have to acknowledge where they are you know i understand that a lot [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2450.72s)]
*  of people are deeply upset by what's happened in gaza so am i you know pivoting to you know i've [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2456.7999999999997s)]
*  done more for the palestinians that's the people's ears just shut off you know the very people you're [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2462.8799999999997s)]
*  trying to reach stop listening as soon as he said that right it's not credible when they also know [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2468.48s)]
*  that you're the u.s is supplying all of the bombs that are getting dropped on gaza it well obviously [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2472.72s)]
*  it's not it's obviously not credible and and it it it speaks to kind of a bunker mentality where [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2478.32s)]
*  i'm sure he does think wow i'd make a lot of phone calls to open some crossings to get some [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2485.36s)]
*  aid into egypt but the person looking from the outside sees the bombs that you gave and sees [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2489.12s)]
*  all the aid that hasn't gotten through you know and and you're not going to get from just a purely [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2494.08s)]
*  pragmatic political standpoint you're not only going to not reach the audience the audience is [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2499.28s)]
*  going to shut you out and think that you're not respecting them you know and that's the other [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2504.4s)]
*  thing about you know even the way he went at the zionism question you know do you know what it is [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2508.2400000000002s)]
*  like it just um that's not going to what what vote is the point of that interview tommy and i'll ask [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2513.6s)]
*  put you the question to you i assume the point of that interview is to convince [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2520.4s)]
*  young voters who are on the fence about joe biden to vote for joe biden right like [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2524.88s)]
*  why is that approach do you think there's a single person that would have gone and skeptical joe [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2528.8s)]
*  biden been like you know what like i you know now i've changed my mind and supported him you know [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2534.4s)]
*  no i mean i assume they did this interview with complex because they wanted to reach young voters [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2539.6s)]
*  and young voters of color in particular because the trump the trump team is very clear about their [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2544.1600000000003s)]

*  you know they have an emotional experience with an aging parent and this feels like that and i [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2597.52s)]
*  was like no i got nothing there i got an emotional experience losing to donald trump once [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2602.32s)]

*  nobody's onboard for the palestinians and i have and it's uh that's an alarming window into a bunker [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2626.24s)]
*  mentality that is kind of missing yes because on some level i'm sure he has spent dozens if not [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2632.0s)]
*  hundreds of hours being like bb let more aid through right and no one else in the world has [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2640.08s)]
*  probably done what he's done to get more trucks in or whatever it doesn't mean it's sufficient [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2645.12s)]
*  yeah exactly that's exactly dc like you experienced this too then in comms people in dc are so focused [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2649.36s)]
*  on like inputs and not outputs or outcomes you know what i mean like whatever something would [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2656.16s)]
*  happen in the world administration tries to get credit for it and you do like a tiktok story [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2663.92s)]
*  where you do the sort of the the backdrop for how a thing went down and you tell the reporters about [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2668.7999999999997s)]
*  how many meetings you held and calls and interagency this and that and it's just like [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2673.2799999999997s)]
*  bullshit all that matters is did you infect the outcome in a way that matters or not yeah and i [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2678.16s)]
*  admit to being guilty of this so me too i'll frame it this way which is well no but it's also [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2683.52s)]
*  that you you get you start to feel sorry for yourself right you're working really hard on [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2688.32s)]
*  intractable problems everybody's criticizing you nobody's aware of all the things you've done [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2693.68s)]
*  you've been in x number of meetings things are a little bit better than they would have been [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2699.68s)]
*  because of the stuff that you're doing but i would always try to and you know maybe i encourage the [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2702.64s)]
*  biden people to this like and i say this from having been in a in the wrong place on this at [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2707.04s)]
*  times i always would be corrected by meeting with people outside of the bubble of politics so for [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2711.28s)]
*  instance you know syria like is a horrible problem where i think obama got a lot of criticism some [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2717.52s)]
*  was fair but some felt unfair and we were working really hard on that and we were we were doing what [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2723.76s)]
*  you know we got some chemical weapons out and we got some aid in and why don't they give us [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2728.0800000000004s)]
*  credit for that and then you know i'd get deeper and deeper into that bunker mentality and then [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2731.28s)]
*  i'd be in like a meeting with people that were like you know victims of torture my family was [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2736.88s)]
*  killed yeah and all of a sudden you're like oh shit right i lost the thread here uh the story [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2742.56s)]
*  is not like i'm not the victim of the gaza war i say this having been there you know like [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2747.6s)]
*  and that biden kind of you know i heard that mindset a bit in that answer yeah i did too [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2753.28s)]
*  uh we got a few more things we'll try to go a little faster because that's just fun talking [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2758.7200000000003s)]
*  yeah it's fun talking about jd uh yeah so this week we saw presidential and parliamentary elections [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2762.32s)]
*  in rwanda but there was not a ton of suspense uh provisional results show that president paul [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2767.76s)]
*  kagame has won 99 of the vote which is the same vote share when he was uh re-elected in 2017 [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2773.52s)]
*  congratulations amazing results sir hard fought win uh kagame has been president since 2000 uh and [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2779.36s)]
*  sort of a leading force in the country's politics since 1994 the 1994 genocide uh he did had some [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2785.36s)]
*  competition there were six candidates banned from running by the electoral commission there [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2791.2s)]
*  were two opposition candidates who were allowed to run against him the same ones that were allowed [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2796.48s)]
*  to run in 2017 so sort of a fake opposition rwanda currently has about 3 000 troops in the eastern [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2800.56s)]
*  part of the democratic republic of congo fighting alongside the rebel group m23 to gain control of [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2807.4399999999996s)]
*  the minerals in the region uh m23 says they're fighting for the rights of congolese tutsis a [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2813.3599999999997s)]
*  minority group with rwandan roots according to a un report a lot of people are concerned this could [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2818.0s)]
*  snowball into a wider regional conflict um so ben i don't know that kagame got 99 of the vote uh but [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2823.04s)]
*  it is also no surprise that rwandans would vote for stability especially when not really given any [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2830.0s)]
*  option uh the government cracks down on or kills a lot of its political opponents but any thoughts [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2836.32s)]
*  on how the u.s can or should work with someone like kagame for another five years given that he's [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2841.92s)]
*  just clearly an autocrat and there's nothing we could do about it well you know he broke the [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2847.12s)]
*  constitutional term limits when obama was president we made this effort to kind of get him to step [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2851.68s)]
*  aside and we made some arguments it might sound familiar you know you'll be celebrated for stepping [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2856.7999999999997s)]
*  down being the right thing for your country and george washington and uh and he said thank you uh [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2861.92s)]
*  you know fuck off you know uh but to take it seriously uh you know there's been democratic [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2868.64s)]
*  backsliding afghans and everywhere some of it is like of the coup variety but some of it is a [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2874.4s)]
*  genuine belief kagame matters more than just for one for two reasons one i know some very smart [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2879.52s)]
*  you know entrepreneurs in africa or people even in politics in africa who say kagame is a good [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2887.44s)]
*  model you know like he sure he's not a crap but like you know half the parliament's women the [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2893.12s)]
*  streets are clean like the growth rates are good the foreign assistance flows in the economy is [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2899.52s)]
*  growing and he kind of has come to represent this model for an african leader who's like a benign [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2904.88s)]
*  you know the the positive spin would be he's like a benign autocrat you know just trying to [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2910.96s)]
*  you know hold the country together i think the negative piece though is not just in the persecution [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2915.6s)]
*  of the political opposition which is obvious but it's what you said too like he's he's meddled in [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2920.32s)]
*  the drc in ways that have cost lots of lives like it's not all benign you know like uh there's [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2925.36s)]
*  malign stuff happening in terms of human rights at home and in terms of neighboring countries [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2932.6400000000003s)]
*  and i think the u.s has to focus on that behavior like we're not going to persuade [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2936.56s)]
*  kagame to become a democrat a small d democrat so here i'm actually arguing to be pragmatic like [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2940.88s)]
*  i'd be focused on trying to get him to moderate what he's doing in other countries trying to get [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2945.52s)]
*  him to say like hey look man we get that you're in power you don't need to you know assassinate [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2951.84s)]
*  people in other countries as they've done you know so so i i think the the goal for the next [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2955.92s)]
*  five years should be to try to you know curb the excesses as it were yeah well let's turn to kenya [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2959.76s)]
*  because this is sort of example of probably what he fears yeah which is there there were several [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2965.76s)]
*  weeks into what has been called uh the gen z protests these were initially sparked by uh [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2969.76s)]
*  president william rudo's plan to raise taxes on basic goods and services in order to pay off the [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2975.04s)]
*  country's 80 billion dollars in public debt these demonstrations began peacefully but became violent [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2980.0s)]
*  with some protesters storming and burning part of parliament in late june rudo scrapped the tax plan [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2985.52s)]
*  he has instituted some cuts in government spending but the demonstrations are continuing against the [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2991.92s)]
*  police violence in response to protesters government corruption and now rudo himself [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=2997.6s)]
*  who activists want out of office according to the kenya national commission on human rights at least [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3002.16s)]
*  50 people have been killed in the protests hundreds have been detained and interrogated [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3007.36s)]
*  by the government security forces and 59 people have been abducted and are still missing rudo [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3011.28s)]
*  is scrambling to respond to this uh last week he fired most of his cabinet and promised to hold a [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3017.04s)]
*  national dialogue to ease tensions he also accepted the resignation of his police chief over his [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3022.0s)]
*  handling of the protests but the protests are still going now this tuesday saw more demonstrations to [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3026.96s)]
*  which the police responded with tear gas uh and in one case by shooting into the crowd um we spoke [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3032.3199999999997s)]
*  with two protesters in kenya the first uh man you'll hear from is named brian and the second is named [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3038.0s)]
*  ojango there are a lot of questions going on in this country about the loans that we have been [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3044.24s)]
*  taking from the world bank from the imf from countries like china where does this money go to [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3049.4399999999996s)]
*  because it has not served the purpose the government or the politicians have been stealing [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3058.7999999999997s)]
*  this money taking this money to offshore accounts we want this money back in this country people [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3065.44s)]
*  are demanding for accountability from his cabinet there is also the need of ensuring that the [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3072.48s)]
*  legislature and the and the judiciary the ethics and corruption commission are independent [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3078.0s)]
*  the executive has been interfering with these institutions the legislature has been dancing [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3087.6000000000004s)]
*  to the tune of the executive each and every day and people are demanding for the independence of [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3093.84s)]
*  these institutions and accountability above all we have to ensure that the parliament [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3099.84s)]
*  is disbanded and we come up with a new government a government of the people by the people themselves [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3108.5600000000004s)]
*  for my personal safety uh it's a matter of having uh the hope and determination that [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3115.2s)]
*  when i go out to protest and march that uh my voice and my turn out uh will make an impact [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3122.56s)]
*  whether i come back home alive or not i think it's uh up to nature to decide but uh definitely [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3132.16s)]
*  personally i'm i'm so much prepared whether to be abducted or killed i'm so much prepared that [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3141.52s)]
*  uh we are fighting for a better country so then we've talked you know about a lot of protest [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3150.16s)]
*  movements on this show all over the world in the last you know several years um as often happens [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3155.92s)]
*  this one has gone from you know demands about tax policy to calling for the leaders to go [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3161.28s)]
*  do you have any hope on for this one that might be successful i mean what's been interesting so far [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3166.4s)]
*  is that rudo has actually been trying to respond to the protesters right and so what that guy said [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3170.64s)]
*  about corruption is exactly true i think you know that that there's fabulously rich people [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3175.92s)]
*  you know who are mooching off of these foreign loans um which by the way too though the [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3182.24s)]
*  international community is not clean in this either because uh first of all i think you know [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3187.12s)]
*  there have been some debt traps that kenny's been in so we should have probably forgiven some of [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3192.48s)]
*  this debt now one of the reasons why the debt's probably not forgiven is people might know that [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3195.68s)]
*  some of it's being stolen and so they don't want to kind of create that culture either [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3200.0s)]
*  but the point is is that the tax bill touched the nerve because it was passing on some of the fiscal [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3203.68s)]
*  you know hold that the country's in to ordinary people when these elites are still getting and [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3209.6s)]
*  they know they're corrupt and that is like the that is like gasoline you know that's a gliding [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3213.92s)]
*  a match on gasoline right and so that's what the taxing was and and where the protesters are clearly [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3217.68s)]
*  right is to just be like we're sick of this you know like this corruption has got to go [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3222.32s)]
*  um what i worry about is you know i'm totally sympathetic with our the protests you heard from [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3227.52s)]
*  but you know you getting rid of the entirety of the government you know is that's a huge [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3233.36s)]
*  vacuum you know and so the question is can they find some space in between you know tolerating [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3238.4s)]
*  the status quo not making structural changes and kind of trying to burn it all down and then it [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3244.6400000000003s)]
*  becomes a kind of you know competition for power that can become ethnic in kenyan ways that we've [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3250.0s)]
*  seen violence from in the past so the hope has got to be that that there can be some process [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3254.72s)]
*  you know that leads to a totally different kind of government and fundamental reform [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3259.8399999999997s)]
*  but that doesn't kind of open up too big of a vacuum yeah and i think what's interesting [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3263.68s)]
*  about this protest movement so far is the protesters seem more linked by age yeah than [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3267.7599999999998s)]
*  any political ideology or political figure or leader so it has led to this which is hopeful [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3272.64s)]
*  yeah it is hopeful um another hopeful story as we're getting to the end here so some more good [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3277.6s)]

*  this horrific practice is somehow religious in nature and a few months ago it looked very likely [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3301.2s)]
*  to happen but again to protesters i mean women's groups launched a massive campaign over the last [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3307.28s)]

*  he's going to give pudin a green light to run all over ukraine and essentially say if you want to [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3863.3599999999997s)]
*  do it with a nato country next be my guest he's going to give cjing ping a green light to invade [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3869.04s)]
*  taiwan not just because of the chaos he'll create at home but because he's literally said he won't [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3876.24s)]
*  defend taiwan which is the single worst thing you could possibly say when it comes to deterring and [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3881.2s)]
*  preventing a war over taiwan in the pacific something that could literally result in world [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3887.4399999999996s)]
*  war three and then in gaza trump will just do whatever netanyahu wants and of course netanyahu [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3892.56s)]
*  wants to expand and widen the war to keep himself out of prison a theme that he and trump share so [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3898.48s)]
*  this is a very dangerous man for our national security and when i think about just the safety [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3904.72s)]
*  of my kids like preventing a war that could literally harm them i think those are the most [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3909.2s)]
*  dangerous concerns at least for me that come out of a trump presidency yeah vance just adds fuel [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3916.16s)]
*  to the fire yeah i'm really glad you you brought up gaza because that's what i wanted to talk [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3922.72s)]
*  with you about the most because last year literally just days after the october 7 terrorist [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3927.6s)]
*  attack you wrote an op-ed for cnn about the lessons you learned in iraq and how they might [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3933.44s)]
*  apply to an israeli ground invasion in gaza and i just reread it and man it was a prescient [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3939.6s)]
*  piece you wrote quote israel is about to start an invasion of gaza with the same mission we had in [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3946.56s)]
*  those early days in iraq defeat the enemy or netanyahu's words crush and eliminate hamas but [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3951.76s)]
*  the lesson america quickly learned in iraq and afghanistan was that you have to have a plan for [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3957.44s)]
*  the day after can you elaborate a bit on those lessons what concerned you what you learned in [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3961.76s)]
*  iraq and what you think the israelis have gotten right or wrong since you wrote that piece and since [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3967.36s)]
*  the invasion started well the israelis have repeated just about every mistake that we made [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3973.6000000000004s)]
*  in iraq and afghanistan at a big picture level they just thought they could win this war militarily [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3978.0800000000004s)]
*  a war that's fundamentally a counterinsurgency where their enemy hamas is embedded with a [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3984.2400000000002s)]
*  population that they need to win over to succeed and that's the big thing that we missed in the [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3990.48s)]
*  early days of iraq see we went in just defeating the iraqi army right and i was a junior lieutenant [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=3996.16s)]
*  i didn't know any better that made sense to me it was strange when after we entered the occupation [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4002.72s)]
*  phase people said well we got to start paying the iraqi army i remember thinking to myself [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4009.28s)]
*  we just defeated these guys why would we start paying them it quickly became apparent why [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4013.6s)]
*  because we had to win over the civilian population we had to prevent an insurgency [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4019.68s)]
*  from being created or recruited of course the iraqi army was the prime place to recruit an [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4025.84s)]
*  insurgency so get them on our payroll before they're on the bad guys payroll right fundamentally we [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4030.64s)]
*  didn't truly change our strategy until general petraeus took over in iraq in 2007 he he brought [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4038.56s)]
*  the counterinsurgency manual that he had co-authored with general mattis during his [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4046.48s)]
*  time at fort leavenworth with him and he really changed our strategy he said we're going to live [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4051.84s)]
*  out with the population we're not just going to go on these vietnam style search and destroy [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4057.68s)]
*  missions where we just try to kill a bunch of terrorists and then come back to our big safe base [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4063.6s)]
*  at night we're actually going to prove to the iraqi people that we're there to protect them [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4068.0s)]
*  to win them over we're going to build schools we're going to win their hearts and minds and [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4072.64s)]
*  we're going to actually turn them against the insurgency see that was the only way [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4076.0s)]
*  to actually plant the seeds of a democracy so that we could go home because otherwise with every [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4081.04s)]
*  mission that we ran and every innocent civilian caught in the crossfire we risked just recruiting [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4088.0s)]
*  more enemies to the cause this is a insurgent math the term that general mccrystal popularized in [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4094.56s)]
*  afghanistan when he actually had a team study this and he said that for every innocent civilian [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4102.4s)]
*  you kill you recruit somewhere between eight and ten terrorists to the cause because all their [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4107.44s)]
*  friends and family members say all right i hate the americans now i'm going to join the opposition [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4112.639999999999s)]
*  so that's what we learned in iraq and afghanistan if you look at what israel is doing [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4119.28s)]
*  they're doing it all wrong uh they're just trying to kill terrorists at the expense of thousands and [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4124.0s)]
*  thousands of innocent civilians they have no plan whatsoever to establish a political day after [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4130.96s)]
*  that that not just israelis but the palestinians can believe in too and they're not doing anything [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4137.68s)]
*  to actually really support the civilian population to literally win them over to their side in fact [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4142.56s)]
*  they're just totally alienating them and support for hamas is much higher today than it was just [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4148.64s)]
*  before october 7th so that's a mouthful sorry no i look i appreciate it because you were saying it [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4154.72s)]
*  before the ground invasion started and you're not shying away from the reality now and boy [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4162.72s)]
*  10 to 1 i mean that math is pretty terrifying if i'm an israeli civilian and you think i don't [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4168.160000000001s)]
*  15 000 20 000 25 000 innocent civilians have been killed in this war we don't really know [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4174.240000000001s)]
*  it's pretty bad math and it does not work in israel's favor and after the horrific [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4179.84s)]
*  barbaric attacks of october 7th as someone who's always supported israel i'm proud to [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4185.2s)]
*  support israel in its fight against hamas i want israel to win i want israel to defeat hamas [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4190.72s)]
*  because defeating hamas is important not just for israel's security but palestinian security [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4197.28s)]
*  and freedom you're never going to have freedom for palestinians if you have a terrorist organization [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4203.2s)]
*  running the country so everybody should be on the same page with defeating hamas and that's why [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4208.72s)]
*  it's so concerning that what israel is doing is not defeating hamas in fact by some measures [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4215.360000000001s)]
*  they're just empowering the next generation of hamas much like our early efforts against al-qaeda [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4221.68s)]
*  just gave rise to isis in iraq yeah so i mean we're now nine months into this war [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4226.8s)]
*  neither side seems to be able to to get over the finish line with the ceasefire and hostage [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4232.88s)]
*  release deal the israeli military is openly venting about netanyahu and his government's [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4237.76s)]
*  failure to figure out you know a day after the war plan for how gaza will be governed let alone [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4243.04s)]
*  how territory will be held in the interim that has been cleared by the idf there's reports in [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4248.16s)]
*  the new york times that the idf wants to cease fire because they think they need to reconstitute [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4253.4400000000005s)]
*  their forces because there may be another war with hesbala in the north given that context and like [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4258.08s)]
*  that the the toothpaste is well out of the tube in terms of an insurgency and you know all the [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4265.68s)]
*  challenges you mentioned earlier what do you think the best pass the best path forward is [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4271.200000000001s)]
*  to end this current conflict in a way that does the least damage it's a good question and a lot [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4276.4800000000005s)]
*  of people would say that it's too far gone by the way all the criticisms that you cited coming from [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4281.360000000001s)]
*  the idf i mean i'm saying the same thing right so all of my early criticisms are just being echoed [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4288.08s)]
*  by idf and also intelligence israeli intelligence officials today it's not too late to turn it [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4293.36s)]
*  around though i mean that's the lesson that we learned in iraq general petraeus arrived in 2007 [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4301.679999999999s)]
*  to really truly implement a counter-insurgency strategy he had to turn the whole ship of the [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4308.4s)]
*  u.s military but we went into iraq in 2003 so we'd messed it up for four years essentially [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4313.92s)]
*  we had some places where it was successful i think we actually did well in najaf in 2004 for example [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4322.56s)]
*  that was a model to be used for the rest of the country but basically we screwed it up for four [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4328.96s)]
*  years and yet we were able to turn it around and as imperfect as the iraq war was and we probably [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4334.48s)]
*  should never have gone in the first place iraq is actually a functioning democracy today so [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4339.76s)]
*  it's far from perfect a lot of innocent people including of course a lot of american brave [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4345.84s)]
*  americans lost their lives there but it has worked and i think that should give a little bit of hope [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4352.24s)]
*  to the situation in gaza it's not too late for israel to turn this around yeah hopefully after a [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4360.88s)]
*  change in the civilian leadership starting at the very top speaking of which bb netanyahu is going [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4367.76s)]
*  to come address the joint session of congress next week do you guys have any sense of what his [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4372.96s)]
*  message is what he's going to say and is there any opportunity for members of congress like yourself [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4378.96s)]
*  to meet with him directly and offer some of this blunt feedback i've not heard of such an opportunity [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4382.72s)]
*  i would certainly hope so we don't know what he's going to say we don't know if he is going to give [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4387.76s)]
*  a unifying speech to try to solidify bipartisan support for israel or whether he's just going to [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4392.64s)]
*  go on a partisan attack against president biden i mean literally everything is on the table here [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4398.88s)]
*  and and and that's frightening i'm going to attend the speech uh respectfully as i do for [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4404.88s)]
*  every foreign leader who comes to visit but of course there are a lot of my colleagues who plan [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4410.56s)]
*  to boycott and at the end of the day what netanyahu is doing is not in israel's interest that's that's [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4414.56s)]
*  the problem i'm a huge israel supporter i am very much against prime minister netanyahu [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4422.4800000000005s)]
*  and the fundamental reason why is because i don't believe he's acting in israel's [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4428.080000000001s)]
*  interests and you might say hey who am i to judge that well look at his approval rating folks [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4432.8s)]
*  most israelis seem to think that too yeah um switching gears here so i mean everyone in the [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4438.88s)]
*  country was shocked over the weekend by this assassination attempt on president trump [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4444.160000000001s)]
*  thank god he was not killed i mean he was nearly killed he was wounded um you have a lot more [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4449.76s)]
*  experience using firing a weapon or you know securing a location from hostile activities [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4455.28s)]
*  i mean were you as shocked as i was that the secret service failed to secure an elevated [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4462.16s)]
*  position that was reportedly 400 to 500 feet away from the stage where trump was speaking [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4466.4s)]
*  yeah it's absolutely insane i mean i i saw a number that said 130 yards just to put that in [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4471.36s)]
*  perspective every marine goes through a rifle qualification that includes shooting at 500 yards [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4478.24s)]
*  wow i mean even marines who are not going to be in the fight combat correspondents like jd vance [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4485.679999999999s)]
*  right they still have to shoot a rifle at 500 yards and you know i certainly hit the target [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4492.96s)]
*  right and so the fact that someone with the same style rifle we use in the marine corps [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4500.24s)]
*  uh would be allowed to get within 130 yards of a former president is shocking really shocking [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4507.280000000001s)]
*  yeah so i've seen some members republicans actually uh say that there should be a select [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4513.6s)]
*  committee of sorts to investigate what happened and maybe you know a broader set of failings [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4519.280000000001s)]
*  within the secret service organization which is just sort of a black eye after black eye over the [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4524.4800000000005s)]
*  course of you know the last decade or two do you think that makes sense and also just given how [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4528.72s)]
*  fundamental this failure was do we need the results of an investigation before the biden [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4533.52s)]
*  administration makes a change i mean the problem is that you know 10 years ago this would be easy [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4539.4400000000005s)]
*  to say yes bipartisan select committee just like of course we should have had after january 6th [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4544.8s)]
*  the environment in washington has become so politicized that it's not just an easy yes to [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4552.080000000001s)]
*  say that that's the right answer because it will be handled responsibly and well but clearly there [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4557.76s)]

*  now for democrats to win and we started this conversation by just talking about how high the [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4653.52s)]
*  stakes are in this election trump with a blank check from the supreme court to run over rights [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4658.8s)]

*  need to acknowledge that and change your strategy and there's another lesson you learn from the [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4686.32s)]
*  marines tommy and that is they drill this into you all the time it's not about you so i know how [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4691.52s)]

*  constantly hear when i talk to members or you know read press reports it's that everyone is saying [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4728.4800000000005s)]
*  what you're saying privately but very few people are willing to say it publicly why is it that [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4733.76s)]
*  there's like a handful of in many cases more moderate members of congress uh frontline members [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4739.68s)]
*  with challenging re-elections who are having the courage to come out and say this stuff publicly [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4747.12s)]
*  that they're also saying privately like is it intimidation is it general fear like what do [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4752.320000000001s)]

*  when those didn't work and when i decided i owed an honest explanation of my position [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4777.44s)]
*  to my constituents maybe it's because moderates are used to being in tougher races and and just [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4782.5599999999995s)]
*  have realized that the american public wants honesty that you can't just play the partisan [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ompp3Lf-5P0&t=4790.48s)]
