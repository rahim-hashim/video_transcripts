# Bernie Sanders Talks Famine in Gaza, Conditioning Aid to Israel, & Netanyahu's Right Wing Extremism
**Pod Save the World:** [March 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc)
*  Welcome to Pod Save the World, I'm Tommy Vitor. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Ben Rhodes. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2.0s)]
*  Ben, looking good in your hotel room on European vacation? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm in a... [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Actually, you're more of a Nordic vibe at the moment. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Where are you? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=9.72s)]
*  I got a Nordic vibe here. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=10.72s)]
*  I'm in Copenhagen. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=11.72s)]
*  Nice. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=12.72s)]
*  Very good city. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=13.72s)]
*  Great city. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=14.72s)]
*  Nice people here. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=15.72s)]
*  The Danes, I think they figured out a life, Tommy. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=16.72s)]
*  They just seem happy. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=18.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=19.72s)]
*  They don't seem as hung up on stuff as we are. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=20.72s)]
*  Yeah, they got a lot of good things going for them. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=21.72s)]
*  You guys just running around. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=23.92s)]
*  What time is it? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=24.92s)]
*  Like 10 something? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=25.92s)]
*  It's 10 o'clock. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=26.92s)]
*  Now that I've said that they've got it all figured out, they'll probably have some like [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=28.92s)]
*  extreme far right party emerge out of nowhere, like everywhere else. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=32.36s)]
*  But it seems for now, it's like a very pleasant. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=36.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=39.2s)]
*  Well, it's great to connect to you. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=40.2s)]
*  Got a lot going on today. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=41.2s)]
*  I know it's a hard day for you because Aaron Rodgers was passed over as RFK Jr.'s vice [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=42.2s)]
*  president, but we'll get through. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=47.0s)]
*  We are going to cover... [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=50.160000000000004s)]
*  We got an increasingly nasty fight between the US and Israel over Gaza policy, as well [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=51.160000000000004s)]
*  as Trump's latest analysis of the situation, the terrorist attack outside Moscow and the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=55.48s)]
*  growing threat from ISIS-K. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=60.959999999999994s)]
*  We got a new security law in Hong Kong, political resignations in Vietnam and Ireland, some [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=61.959999999999994s)]
*  good news out of Senegal, a wild story about former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=67.2s)]
*  Kate Middleton's cancer diagnosis, and then a very fun fact check out of Haiti. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=72.88s)]
*  And then, Ben, you just talked with Senator Bernie Sanders. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=77.92s)]
*  What did you guys cover? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=79.96s)]
*  I did. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=80.96s)]
*  I talked to Bernie about Gaza, and he's been obviously quite outspoken about the need to [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=81.96s)]
*  condition US assistance, or really just turn off US assistance. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=87.8s)]
*  But then he's also written an article recently for foreign affairs, like Bernie going into [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=93.36s)]
*  the belly of the blob there, and really laying out the case for a revolution in our foreign [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=97.72s)]
*  policy. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=103.96s)]
*  And so we talk about why US foreign policy is broken, what are the incentives the military [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=104.96s)]
*  industrial complex, the other domestic factors that kind of drive this group think that has [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=111.3s)]
*  led us in bad directions, talk about what a different kind of agenda would look like [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=117.22s)]
*  for the United States. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=121.17999999999999s)]
*  It's really interesting conversation. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=122.17999999999999s)]
*  Bernie's given this a lot of thought, you know, and I think, you know, if, as I said [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=123.7s)]
*  to him at the end, if he can begin to have some impact on our foreign policy in the same [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=129.57999999999998s)]
*  way that he's really impacted the mainstream, the Democratic Party on domestic policy, that [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=133.54s)]
*  would be a useful contribution to say the least. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=137.38s)]
*  I'll say. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=141.66s)]
*  Well, I'm very excited to hear that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=142.66s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's remarkable. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=143.82s)]
*  What do you think about 2016 when Bernie was kind of knocked for not knowing enough about [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=145.46s)]
*  foreign policy or not focusing on it enough in his 2016 campaign to today where he really [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=149.34s)]
*  has been pushing in a lot of different directions, not just on, you know, God's policy or Israel, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=154.54s)]
*  but also on kleptocracy and all these other interesting ways. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=159.5s)]
*  So yeah, very impressive. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=162.18s)]
*  Yeah, we talk about that, you know, because I mean, again, the same thing he cares about [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=163.54s)]
*  at home, right? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=166.82s)]
*  The corrupting influence of money. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=167.82s)]
*  It definitely seeps into foreign policy as we've seen. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=170.5s)]
*  Seems like a global problem. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=173.94s)]
*  Well, we, you know, you mentioned he's been leading on Gaza. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=175.18s)]
*  So why don't we turn there? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=177.66s)]
*  Because you know, there's been this growing divide between the U.S. and Israel on what [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=179.62s)]
*  should happen next. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=183.85999999999999s)]
*  And that divide is getting bigger by the week. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=185.57999999999998s)]
*  So the latest fight is over the U.S. decision not to veto a UN Security Council resolution [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=187.85999999999999s)]
*  that called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza in the release of Israeli hostages. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=193.26s)]
*  The U.S. abstained on the vote rather than vote for the resolution because it didn't [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=197.98s)]
*  condemn Hamas. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=202.26s)]
*  But Ambassador Thomas Greenfield, she's vetoed several previous ceasefire resolutions. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=203.8s)]
*  So while the resolution itself was like pretty close to U.S. policy, the U.S. decision to [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=208.34s)]
*  abstain rather than veto was a big change. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=214.42000000000002s)]
*  The White House says that Netanyahu's office was briefed in advance that this might happen. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=218.3s)]
*  But Netanyahu freaked out. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=223.06s)]
*  He canceled a planned Israeli delegation trip to Washington to discuss the Israeli plan [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=224.94s)]
*  to invade Ra'a and generally like decided to make a stank here. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=229.78s)]
*  So Ben, what was interesting to me was how both sides are spinning this. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=234.02s)]
*  The White House line is basically we briefed Bibi in advance. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=239.24s)]
*  There's no real policy change. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=242.58s)]
*  Netanyahu is trying to create a perception of daylight between the U.S. and Israel where [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=244.34s)]
*  there isn't one. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=248.3s)]
*  I'm not sure that's really the full story. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=249.9s)]
*  Netanyahu, on the other hand, is saying that the U.S. had, quote, abandon its policy in [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=252.22s)]
*  the UN today, which again, it's not totally accurate in terms of the letter of the resolution. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=257.02s)]
*  But it does probably reflect Bibi's view that the U.S. is supposed to veto every U.N. resolution [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=262.34s)]
*  critical of Israel because in the past that's what the U.S. has done with a few notable [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=268.66s)]
*  exceptions. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=272.82s)]
*  But how big a deal do you think the abstention vote was? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=273.82s)]
*  And what do you think about like that the spin from both sides tells us about where [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=278.22s)]
*  this relationship is heading? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=282.6s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot going on here. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=283.98s)]
*  I mean, first of all, it's a step in the right direction. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=285.26000000000005s)]
*  I mean, we've been saying for a long time that the U.S. should not be seen as obstructing [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=287.70000000000005s)]
*  the UN Security Council trying to address the situation, address the humanitarian catastrophe [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=292.3s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=297.54s)]
*  And so just the action of the U.S. allowing for through an abstention this to go through, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=298.54s)]
*  I think kind of cements the international view that there needs to be a ceasefire. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=304.26000000000005s)]
*  Now just on the substance of the resolution, as you said, it's kind of in between where [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=308.34000000000003s)]
*  the U.N. Security Council is big and which is calling for a permanent and immediate ceasefire [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=313.02000000000004s)]
*  and where the U.S. has been because they took out the word permanent and essentially they [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=318.26000000000005s)]
*  called for a ceasefire through Ramadan, which is only a couple more weeks in exchange for [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=322.5s)]
*  and also call for the release of the hostages. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=327.82000000000005s)]
*  So it is, you know, kind of in between where the U.S. has been and where the U.N. Security [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=329.82s)]
*  Council has been. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=335.65999999999997s)]
*  But I think a step in the right direction. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=336.65999999999997s)]
*  Now on the spin on the U.S. side, I don't understand this because their spin has basically [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=338.74s)]
*  been this is not a change in policy, nothing to see here. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=345.78s)]
*  And I don't understand that because what's the point of doing this? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=350.34s)]
*  You know, why not just own? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=353.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, we're frustrated. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=355.21999999999997s)]
*  Netanyahu is not listening to us. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=357.5s)]
*  We think Roth would be a disaster. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=359.32s)]
*  And so we moved to this position. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=361.44s)]
*  And they also said it wasn't binding. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=362.96s)]
*  Ben, did you notice that too, which was surprising to me, sort of undercutting when I saw. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=364.59999999999997s)]
*  But I just don't. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=369.24s)]
*  If it's not a change in policy, then then why do it? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=370.86s)]
*  Like, I don't quite understand why they're at such pains to act like this isn't a shift. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=374.36s)]
*  And I say that because in a good way, it's a shift, you know, like, so just own the fact [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=380.58s)]
*  that this is a different step that you're taking because the Israeli government has [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=384.56s)]
*  not listened to you because they're committed to going through this Operation Mraffa over [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=390.20000000000005s)]
*  your objections. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=394.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=395.68s)]
*  The BB spin. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=396.68s)]
*  Look, we know what's going on here now. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=397.68s)]
*  He wants the fight with the Democratic president. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=400.40000000000003s)]
*  He wants to appeal over the heads of Democrats to Republicans to get his back. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=403.0s)]
*  He's got all of his chips on Trump winning this election. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=408.96000000000004s)]
*  That's what he's doing. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=411.32s)]
*  So he's running the play where he basically is looking. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=412.32s)]
*  Probably didn't know they were going to abstain, acted like he's surprised. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=418.24s)]
*  And that's all the more reason why the U.S. doesn't need to be acting like we're still [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=422.64s)]
*  hugging him somehow, even though we're doing this, you know. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=426.32s)]
*  And the last thing I'd say is that this idea that, you know, he says we've violated our [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=429.64s)]
*  policy like the last time I checked Tommy, the United States of America is a sovereign [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=433.68s)]
*  nation. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=437.52s)]
*  I didn't know that we took instructions from Bibi Netanyahu about how we voted the United [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=438.52s)]
*  Nations. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=442.52s)]
*  Again, that's all the more reason it's an indication of how broken this relationship [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=443.52s)]
*  is that he believes he's in a position where he gets to tell Linda Thomas Greenfield how [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=447.0s)]
*  to vote at the UN. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=451.4s)]
*  That's absolutely insane. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=452.71999999999997s)]
*  Ben, it reminds me of a famous Bill Clinton quote where he walked out of a meeting with [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=453.71999999999997s)]
*  Netanyahu and he said, who's the fucking superpower here to a bunch of his aides nearby because [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=458.0s)]
*  BB was pushing him around. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=463.28s)]
*  And also, to your point, I think part of the reason the U.S. had to abstain on this vote [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=464.52s)]
*  is because we're worried that the view on the world is that the UN Security Council [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=469.44s)]
*  is permanently broken and worthless and not even, you know, people are questioning whether [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=474.88s)]
*  it should exist anymore. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=479.78s)]
*  And if we're the ones who are contributing to that by blocking a resolution that basically [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=480.78s)]
*  states policy that we mostly agree with, I think we're part of the problem and they recognize [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=486.2s)]
*  that. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=491.64s)]
*  This rift between the U.S. and Israel, it's far beyond Gaza at the moment. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=493.0s)]
*  I mean, Tony Blinken, who's been a staunch defender of Israel, the Secretary of State, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=497.71999999999997s)]
*  went to Tel Aviv last week and upon his arrival, Smotrich, the finance minister, announced [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=502.0s)]
*  the single largest West Bank land seizure since 1993. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=508.59999999999997s)]
*  So just a drastic step in the direction of increased settlement construction. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=512.3199999999999s)]
*  So there's all these instances happening in close proximity of Israeli and U.S. officials [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=516.32s)]
*  punching each other in the face either through actions or words. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=523.1600000000001s)]
*  And it's not good setup. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=525.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=527.6800000000001s)]
*  And Tommy, I'm kind of mystified too by some of the coverage of this as if this is all [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=528.6800000000001s)]
*  shocking. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=532.36s)]
*  The Bill Clinton anecdote you relayed is from 30 years ago. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=533.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=538.8000000000001s)]
*  Like this is who BB has always been. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=539.8000000000001s)]
*  Every president gets here. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=541.8800000000001s)]
*  We're not learning something new about this guy. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=542.8800000000001s)]
*  And if you talk about the rift, again, the rift isn't just about this UN resolution. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=545.2s)]
*  The U.S. and Israel don't agree about this RAF operation. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=549.84s)]
*  The U.S. and Israel don't agree about aid getting into Gaza, which Israel's obstructing. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=552.96s)]
*  The U.S. and Israel don't agree about whether there should be a Palestinian state. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=557.96s)]
*  The U.S. and Israel don't agree about settlement construction in the West Bank. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=562.44s)]
*  Basically anything. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=567.9200000000001s)]
*  This Israeli government, this far right extremist Israeli government is out of step with exactly [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=570.34s)]
*  existing U.S. policy on just about every single issue that is at stake in the relationship. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=575.16s)]
*  So this isn't some short term personality break. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=582.24s)]
*  I mean, the press loves to cover this as some, you know, BB, you know, Biden bromance ending [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=586.0799999999999s)]
*  or something when in fact it's about real substance. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=594.16s)]
*  And when you actually reckon with that, the issues get more difficult, not easier, because [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=597.88s)]
*  this isn't kind of thing where you can like paper over differences between two leaders. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=602.16s)]
*  This is about a far right government in Israel that is committed to settlement construction [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=606.16s)]
*  in the West Bank. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=609.76s)]
*  This can committed to like preventing assistance from getting people in Gaza that is committed [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=610.76s)]
*  to preventing a Palestinian state. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=616.56s)]
*  And we are going to have to reckon with that as United States. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=619.04s)]
*  If we truly believe those things that we say. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=621.64s)]
*  The other thing that happened earlier today, Ben, was the Israelis withdrew their team [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=623.4399999999999s)]
*  from Qatar that had been trying to negotiate a ceasefire and a hostage release. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=627.4399999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu in part blamed the United States for that failure to reach a deal saying, quote, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=631.92s)]
*  Hamas's stance clearly demonstrates its utter disinterest in a negotiated deal and attest [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=636.76s)]
*  to the damage done by the UN Security Council resolution. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=641.36s)]
*  He continued Hamas rebuffed all US offers for a compromise while celebrating the Security [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=645.04s)]
*  Council's resolution. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=649.56s)]
*  Again, the White House responded to this statement by pointing out to Axios that Hamas had formulated [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=650.56s)]
*  its response to this, you know, sort of the latest hostage deal offer before the UN vote [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=657.0400000000001s)]
*  even occurred. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=663.5600000000001s)]
*  Also, you know, so the terms that have been discussed were, again, according to Axios, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=664.5600000000001s)]
*  Israel had agreed to a six week ceasefire, the release of 700 Palestinian prisoners in [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=670.96s)]
*  exchange for 40 Israeli hostages. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=675.8000000000001s)]
*  And Israel also agreed to gradually allow about 2000 Palestinians back into northern [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=678.72s)]
*  Gaza per day. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=682.88s)]
*  Hamas was demanding a full ceasefire, a withdrawal of Israeli troops out of Gaza and the return [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=684.7199999999999s)]
*  to civilians to northern Gaza and the prisoner release. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=689.8399999999999s)]
*  So pretty far apart in both cases. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=692.7199999999999s)]
*  But there are also some Israeli officials in this Axios story who said that Netanyahu [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=695.0799999999999s)]
*  didn't give his negotiators enough latitude to make a deal. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=699.28s)]
*  He figured they could just squeeze them and they were pointing the finger at him for this [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=702.4399999999999s)]
*  failure. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=706.56s)]
*  So I don't know, terrible news, though, for like the hostages and their families. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=707.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=710.4399999999999s)]
*  And anyone wants a ceasefire. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=711.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=712.9200000000001s)]
*  And if this rough operation goes forward, I just don't know, you know, what that means [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=713.9200000000001s)]
*  for the hostages, what that means for obviously the people in Gaza. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=717.9200000000001s)]
*  And Netanyahu keeps saying he's going to do it. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=722.2s)]
*  And I again, I just I don't understand. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=724.2s)]
*  I think part of what Netanyahu is doing is he's trying to show with this kind of, you [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=727.96s)]
*  know, tantrum about the Security Council resolution that if we begin to turn up some pressure [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=732.24s)]
*  on him, that it's not going to work. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=738.48s)]
*  Now, I frankly think the answer to that, as you'll hear with Bernie, is actually more [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=741.04s)]
*  of it, more pressure, you know, like cutting off military assistance full stop. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=746.28s)]
*  I don't want to I don't think the United States should be arming a government that is starving [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=750.88s)]
*  you know, children in Gaza. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=756.0799999999999s)]
*  And again, I don't think if Netanyahu didn't care about the pressure, he wouldn't freak [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=758.52s)]
*  out so much about the Security Council resolution. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=763.04s)]
*  It's actually a demonstration that they are concerned about it, you know. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=765.4399999999999s)]
*  And so to me, like, I don't think we should allow ourselves to get bullied back into doing [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=769.24s)]
*  whatever Bibi Netanyahu wants us to be doing at the UN or with military assistance. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=775.0s)]
*  I think the point is we need to stand behind our positions. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=779.48s)]
*  And I hope we see more out of that from the Biden administration. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=782.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=785.48s)]
*  And Netanyahu is also reportedly under a lot of political pressure over some proposed law [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=786.48s)]
*  changes that could force ultra-orthodox Israelis to do compulsory military service. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=790.72s)]
*  Obviously they're exempt, but that is becoming completely untenable as reservists are called [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=796.72s)]
*  up for longer and longer periods of time and as the ultra-orthodox population grows. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=801.36s)]
*  But if Netanyahu removes the exemption, he could lose the support of his far-right minister. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=806.6s)]
*  So I think people think that might be in the back of his head. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=810.9200000000001s)]
*  But then, I mean, any plan Netanyahu might have to turn on Biden completely and go all [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=813.6s)]
*  in for Trump got a little more complicated after a recent interview Trump did with this [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=818.12s)]
*  Three widely distributed Israeli newspaper called Israel Haom, which is owned by the [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=823.16s)]
*  family of the late right-wing billionaire Sheldon Adelson and is basically known to [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=828.12s)]
*  do puff pieces on Netanyahu. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=832.4s)]
*  So this is the part of the interview that raised a lot of eyebrows. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=834.3399999999999s)]
*  Here's a clip. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=837.8s)]
*  You have to finish up your war. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=838.8s)]
*  You have to finish it up. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=839.8s)]
*  You got to get it done. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=841.56s)]
*  And I'm sure you'll do that. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=843.36s)]
*  And we got to get to peace. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=845.8s)]
*  You can't have this going on. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=846.8s)]
*  And I will say Israel has to be very careful because you're losing a lot of the world. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=849.2s)]
*  You're losing a lot of support. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=853.5600000000001s)]
*  But you have to finish up. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=854.5600000000001s)]
*  You have to get the job done. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=856.2s)]
*  And you have to get on to peace. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=857.76s)]
*  It's like classic Trump, right? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=859.36s)]
*  He says you have to finish the job, which you could interpret as going to Rafa. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=860.6400000000001s)]
*  But he also implies that he wants the war over. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=863.76s)]
*  But you know, it was interesting. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=866.48s)]
*  The full interview is not out yet. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=868.12s)]
*  They put out like 10 minutes of it. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=869.24s)]
*  But Trump spends a lot of time attacking Democrats for criticizing Israel. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=870.76s)]
*  But he never says, Bibi has my full support. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=875.26s)]
*  He never says we got to give him what he needs to finish the job, do whatever it takes. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=878.3199999999999s)]
*  It's not like a full throated endorsement. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=882.56s)]
*  What did you make of this, you know, interview, this clip? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=885.24s)]
*  I think what I make of it is that Netanyahu, the Israeli right wing, would be making a [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=888.8s)]
*  big mistake to put all of their eggs in the Trump basket. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=896.0799999999999s)]
*  This is a man who's like basically thrown everybody under the bus, you know, from new [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=900.6s)]
*  NBC News contributor, Ron McDaniel. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=908.52s)]
*  Yeah, well, maybe to world leaders that he was friends with and then frenemies with. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=910.96s)]
*  He is still mad at Bibi for not backing him up on the big lie and January, you know, the [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=920.12s)]
*  election results. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=925.96s)]
*  He kind of sees Bibi as like a rhino or something because it's back to the idea that Biden [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=927.2s)]
*  didn't win the election. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=934.4000000000001s)]
*  And so this notion that you're going to be totally isolated, right, from basically the [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=935.88s)]
*  entire every government in the world, essentially, if the US is moving in the direction they're [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=942.0400000000001s)]
*  moving in the Security Council, because you're counting on both Donald Trump to win the [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=947.88s)]
*  election and then Donald Trump to, you know, be your security blanket in the world. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=952.56s)]
*  This is just not a guy that I rely on. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=958.2399999999999s)]
*  And by the way, the fact that he keeps saying these anti-Semitic things about how he [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=961.04s)]
*  couldn't imagine how Jews could ever vote for anybody except him because of, you know, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=965.9599999999999s)]
*  Chuck Schumer's speech about Israel or something, suggesting, by the way, that American [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=971.68s)]
*  Jews are basically not fully American. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=976.56s)]
*  They vote purely based on on Israel. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=980.36s)]
*  That, too, would make me question whether this is the man that we want to put our faith in [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=983.16s)]
*  our security. So one would think, I don't know, like, yeah, like it like it's definitely [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=988.3199999999999s)]
*  like, you know, there's a kind of green light on Roth, like you said, go finish the job. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=993.4799999999999s)]
*  But I'm not sure that this is the long term insurance policy that I would want if I was [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=996.5999999999999s)]
*  the state of Israel. I think I'd rather have some like, you know, Joe Biden, who actually [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1003.28s)]
*  seems to care about the future of Israel for something other than his own political [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1007.48s)]
*  purposes. Yeah, it's not the love fest that Trump gives to Xi Jinping or Viktor Orban. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1011.24s)]
*  That's for damn sure. Ben, Trump was also asked, do you plan to visit Israel? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1015.1600000000001s)]
*  That was the question. Like three sentences into the answer, he says, quote, Here we have a lot [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1019.36s)]
*  of people in the United States who are Jewish, but they actually fight Israel. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1024.68s)]
*  Look at the New York Times. It's a Jewish family. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1027.3600000000001s)]
*  I think they hate Israel. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1029.16s)]
*  Later in the interview, he said that Biden and Harris, quote, support the enemy. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1031.28s)]
*  And this was his explanation for how October 7th happened. Here's a clip. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1034.92s)]
*  That was a horrible attack. But it was an attack that I blame on Biden because they [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1038.16s)]
*  have no respect for him. He can't put two sentences together. He can't talk. He's a very [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1043.92s)]
*  dumb person. He's a dumb person. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1048.64s)]
*  So apparently that's why Hamas wanted to attack Israel. No other reason. It's just Biden's [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1050.28s)]
*  speaking style, I guess. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1056.68s)]
*  Yeah, real depth of analysis there. I mean, but again, like the answer to even the October 7th [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1057.8400000000001s)]
*  question, which should be the one where you can show some empathy for Israel. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1063.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1066.2s)]
*  All he pivots to is his own political interests. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1066.68s)]
*  Totally. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1068.68s)]
*  You know, trashing Joe Biden, like memo to people who think that this is your friend. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1069.04s)]
*  This guy doesn't care about anything but himself and his own interests. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1074.04s)]
*  This is not your friend. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1077.88s)]
*  No, not your friend. Just a few things we're keeping an eye on. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1079.0s)]
*  So first, the Biden administration is reviewing a set of Israeli assurances that U.S. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1081.72s)]
*  weapons are being used in accordance with U.S. and international law. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1086.68s)]
*  Aid groups, 17 Democrats in the Senate say absolutely not. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1090.6s)]
*  No, they are not. We'll see though. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1094.2s)]
*  So can anybody with two eyes? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1095.96s)]
*  Yeah, anyone with a New York Times subscription. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1097.8799999999999s)]
*  It's not the hardest review to pull off. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1100.48s)]
*  It shouldn't be. But we'll see if President Biden decides to cut off future weapons transfers. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1102.72s)]
*  Also, that bill that just passed to keep the government open cuts off funding to UNRWA [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1108.0s)]
*  until March of 2025. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1113.44s)]
*  That's the UN organization that employs 13,000 people in Gaza. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1115.36s)]
*  It distributes most of the assistance. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1118.84s)]
*  Over the weekend, the Israeli government also said they will no longer allow UNRWA [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1120.96s)]
*  to bring food aid into northern Gaza. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1124.6s)]
*  So the future of the entire organization is quite unclear. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1126.76s)]
*  That U.S. funding bill, though, it did include another 3.8 million in military assistance to Israel. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1130.28s)]
*  And then finally, Ben, we talked so much about the humanitarian situation. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1135.72s)]
*  We talked about how an Israeli invasion of Ra'aqa could make it exponentially worse. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1139.12s)]
*  I just did want to point out that while there hasn't been a full-scale invasion of Ra'aqa, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1144.84s)]
*  even though Ron Dermer, a top Netanyahu aide, was on the record today saying it's going to happen, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1148.68s)]
*  the IDF is still targeting Ra'aqa with airstrikes as we speak. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1154.0s)]
*  So the people there are hardly safe. It's not a safe haven. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1157.2s)]
*  It's just there hasn't been a full-scale ground invasion, just so folks know what we're talking about. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1159.88s)]
*  Yeah. And the one thing I want to pick up on there is the UNRWA piece, because this is really grotesque. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1163.88s)]
*  And shame on... [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1171.0s)]
*  Let's just talk to Democrats here, because I'm not sure how many Republicans in Congress are listening to this show. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1174.0s)]
*  But the idea that when there is a famine that risks killing thousands of children, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1179.72s)]
*  the idea that you're performatively voting to ban assistance to the number one, two, three, four and five best way to get assistance to the people in Gaza, it's ridiculous. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1188.44s)]
*  I mean, there's no justification for it. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1202.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, how are you going to feel if you look back a year from now and realize that thousands of children died [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1205.6s)]
*  because you were afraid to take a stand and say, you know what, we shouldn't be cutting off aid to the basically the only aid delivery mechanism that works in Gaza, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1212.4399999999998s)]
*  because there are a handful of people out of tens of thousands who work with UNRWA who are alleged to be part of October 7th, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1225.28s)]
*  something that you should investigate, something you should get to the bottom of, something we can hold over UNRWA's head. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1232.3999999999999s)]
*  But turning this off now, it's the worst thing about congressional politics on this issue. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1237.56s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1244.12s)]
*  It's immoral and people should know better. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1245.76s)]
*  And I asked Bernie this, like, how are his colleagues who are not moving to where he is, how are they rationalizing these positions? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1248.6s)]
*  Because this this should not be a close call. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1257.2s)]
*  And yet, you know, this kind of stuff continues to sail through Congress, along with billions of dollars in military assistance. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1261.24s)]
*  And you can't say you're concerned about the humanitarian situation while voting to cut off the capacity to address it. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1267.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it is really frustrating to see how slowly the U.S. government has reacted to this horrifying, evolving situation. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1274.8400000000001s)]
*  But more on that next week. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1282.28s)]
*  So, Ben, our other big story this week is this horrible terrorist attack in Moscow last Friday. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1284.4s)]
*  They killed 139 people and injured over 100. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1289.8400000000001s)]
*  Four gunmen from Tajikistan burst into a concert hall and opened fire at concert goers with automatic weapons. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1292.76s)]
*  And then they doused the venue with flammable liquid and set fire to the venue itself as they escaped. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1298.8400000000001s)]
*  ISIS-K took responsibility for the attack and the attackers uploaded grisly videos of the massacre to ISIS social media channels. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1304.48s)]
*  There have been 11 arrests since Friday, including the four gunmen who appeared in court on Sunday looking like they just had the shit kicked out of them. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1312.0s)]
*  One of them was in a wheelchair. He appeared to be unresponsive to conversation or questioning. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1319.48s)]
*  There's videos of these guys being tortured that have appeared in the Russian media, including one guy with part of his ear cut off by his interrogator who tried to then feed it to him. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1325.24s)]
*  Initially, Vladimir Putin and morons on Twitter like David Sacks tried to blame this terrorist attack on Ukraine. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1334.76s)]
*  But that line became untenable after ISIS took credit and released video evidence that they were behind it. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1342.16s)]
*  Putin has since said the attack was carried out by, quote, radical Islamists. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1348.36s)]
*  But he's still suggesting that Ukraine or the West was actually responsible somehow. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1352.32s)]
*  So that narrative for Putin is deeply complicated by the fact that the US embassy in Moscow issued a security alert on March 7th warning that extremists had imminent plans to attack large gatherings in Moscow, including concerts. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1356.44s)]
*  Their timing was a bit off, but they obviously had the gist of it down. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1370.0800000000002s)]
*  Putin dismissed the warning before the attack actually happened as an attempt to intimidate and destabilize Russia. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1374.4s)]
*  So, Ben, I think there's like two big policy conversations to come out of this. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1380.4s)]
*  The first is how Putin is likely to respond and the second is just this growing threat from ISIS-K. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1384.28s)]
*  So let's take the Putin part first. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1388.48s)]
*  Pretty much every expert you see seems to think that he's going to use this as a pretext to crack down on just whoever he decides is his enemy. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1390.68s)]
*  That could include Ukraine, critics in politics. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1397.8799999999999s)]
*  He might reinstate the death penalty to end up killing off these ISIS guys or just appear even more hardline. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1401.84s)]
*  Putin has this history of basically spinning his own security failings for political gain. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1408.56s)]
*  There are even some people who believe that the FSB was behind a series of apartment bombings in Russia in 1999 that kind of paved Putin's way into the into power. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1413.92s)]
*  Do you agree with that broad assessment? What do you think we should be watching in terms of how Russia reacts? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1423.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think in the past, you're right. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1427.44s)]
*  Like he, you know, I mean, there's a lot of smoke around that conspiracy theory. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1430.44s)]
*  There's actually fire there. The FSB was like caught like planning stuff in these apartment buildings. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1435.8000000000002s)]
*  And Putin, you know, not just in those attacks, but even in what were clearly, you know, other types of Islamist attacks in Russia. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1441.84s)]
*  The Beslan school attack being the most notable one that where they took a whole bunch of children, hostages and hundreds end up getting killed in this kind of heavy handed Russian military response. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1451.8799999999999s)]
*  Putin ended up using that as a pretext to do things like cancel the direct election of governors. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1463.24s)]
*  And so there is a pattern of him using his own security failures, like you said, to just have more even more onerous crackdowns. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1470.64s)]
*  And so what I'd be looking for is does he expand this kind of totalitarian control of the state? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1479.1200000000001s)]
*  And does he use this as a pretext to crack down not just on potential people nexus to ISIS, but anybody that he deems a political opponent above and beyond what he's already even done? [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1485.6000000000001s)]
*  And I think that's quite possible and likely. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1497.84s)]
*  I think the other thing I watched Tommy's I don't think this torture thing is a sideshow. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1499.6s)]
*  I think this is kind of the point. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1503.44s)]
*  Yeah, these videos found their way onto telegram channels controlled by Russian nationalists. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1505.2s)]
*  The government wanted these videos out. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1511.0s)]
*  Definitely. And then, yeah, you've got like a guy in a wheelchair with like a bag of his own piss on a catheter and then another guy with an ear missing. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1512.84s)]
*  This isn't a message, not just to terrorists. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1522.56s)]
*  This is like what could happen to any political opponent inside of Russia right now. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1526.0s)]
*  And it's deeply, deeply messed up. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1530.16s)]
*  I mean, this is a degree of like sadism that that I just have never seen before. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1532.48s)]
*  You know, and I worry about a society that is this dark. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1537.44s)]
*  You know, it just kind of where is that going? [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1541.76s)]
*  One of the Navalny people had a good line, which is like today it's the terrorism suspects tomorrow could be journalists. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1544.56s)]
*  It could be any opposition figure. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1550.36s)]
*  And so I think part of the point here is is this kind of absolute brutality that kind of goes beyond anything I can remember, you know, seeing that they're just kind of advertising this stuff. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1552.6399999999999s)]
*  So so that to me, it's a pretty dark harbinger of like exactly where is where Russia is now and where it's going. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1564.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, obviously, I have no love lost for ISIS or terrorists in general. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1571.6s)]
*  But to cut a suspect's ear off and try to feed it to him, I mean, that suggests a level of like brutality and brutal. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1575.52s)]
*  I mean, it's just it's sick. It's a sick thing to do. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1582.16s)]
*  Who would think to do that? Yeah. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1585.24s)]
*  And not because you're not to be sympathetic to that guy. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1586.64s)]
*  It's just like it's just showing that there's no norms anymore. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1588.72s)]
*  And this could happen to anybody. Russia decides to do it, too. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1591.6000000000001s)]
*  So let's talk about ISIS, K. They are based out of Afghanistan. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1594.44s)]
*  The organization has been around for about a decade. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1598.0400000000002s)]
*  It's known for its brutality. It's known for staging attacks inside Afghanistan and outside of Afghanistan. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1601.0800000000002s)]
*  Those include this recent Moscow attack that we just discussed. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1606.8s)]
*  But in twenty twenty two, they attacked the Russian embassy in Kabul in twenty seventeen. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1609.6s)]
*  ISIS took credit for an attack in St. Petersburg, I think, in the metro in twenty fifteen. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1614.32s)]
*  ISIS took credit for blowing up a charter flight carrying tourists back to Russia from Egypt. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1618.56s)]
*  So there is a history of ISIS going after Russians in particular. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1624.04s)]
*  Islamic extremist groups have long vowed revenge for Russia's carpet bombing of Syria for Russian crackdowns on Muslims in the northern Caucasus area. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1628.52s)]
*  And even the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan even further back. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1637.4s)]
*  So a lot of grievances there. But beyond just attacks on Russians, ISIS was responsible for the Abigate attack that killed 11 US troops and killed or wounded hundreds of Afghan civilians right at the end of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1641.3600000000001s)]
*  They staged a recent major attack in Iran, the attack on the Bataklan Theater in Paris, the bombing at the Ariana Grande concert in England. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1654.3600000000001s)]
*  So then I saw right before we came in that the BBC reported that Turkey is detained about 40 suspects in connection with this Moscow attack. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1662.4s)]
*  I guess two of the suspects were in Turkey as recently as February. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1670.16s)]
*  They're trying to figure out there's some sort of sell there, some other nexus. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1674.92s)]
*  I don't know, man. Obviously, I support it ending the war in Afghanistan. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1678.68s)]
*  But it is very scary to know that these guys have a safe haven in Afghanistan. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1681.3200000000002s)]
*  Unlike Al Qaeda pre 9-11, ISIS and the Taliban are sworn enemies that attack and kill each other. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1685.96s)]
*  But it is still frightening because the head of CENTCOM told a House congressional committee that ISIS K, quote, retains the capability and the will to attack US and Western interests abroad in as little as six months with little or no warning. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1693.2s)]
*  So scary stuff. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1706.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, to give people a tiny bit of background, I mean, I remember I first became familiar with this group back in 2015. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1706.96s)]
*  When the US like first went into Syria against ISIS, this was actually, I think, one of the first targets that US airstrikes hit in Syria. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1716.64s)]
*  And the reason why is that, like our intelligence community back then assessed that within the, you know, underneath the broad umbrella of ISIS, right, this was the collection of people that were focused on external plotting. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1727.0s)]
*  Right. So you had the ISIS that was really focused on kind of governing this. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1739.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1744.0s)]
*  De facto state in Iraq and Syria and fighting on the ground there against various enemies, the Iraqi security forces, Syrians, the US. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1744.28s)]
*  But these were the people that were acting more like Al Qaeda used to act like. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1753.8s)]
*  You know, there was, you know, ISIS wasn't acting like Al Qaeda. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1757.2s)]
*  They were trying to hold territory. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1760.36s)]
*  ISIS K, they were trying to set up the kind of franchise that was focused on this external plotting. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1762.32s)]
*  And they clearly hung around and weathered a lot. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1768.0s)]
*  And they're now ramping up that activity. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1772.48s)]
*  And it's hard to say how much of that is because maybe they have a little more breathing room in Afghanistan. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1775.48s)]
*  I think that's something to dig into so that there's an is this something that is emanating from Afghanistan or they effectively franchised and they're in places like Turkey, they're still in Syria. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1781.04s)]
*  They're operating globally. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1791.24s)]
*  I think they're clearly the preeminent, you know, external terrorist threat out there. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1792.92s)]
*  And the other thing about Russia, I'd say, is that, you know, when Russia was carpet bombing Syria, I think there were a lot of warnings. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1799.68s)]
*  And, you know, even back to the Obama years, we were warning Russia like, hey, this is going to come back to you guys. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1806.64s)]
*  Totally. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1810.92s)]
*  And it didn't right away. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1811.68s)]
*  And so a bunch of people were like, oh, see, like, you know, they're still just focused on the US. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1813.0400000000002s)]
*  No, no, these people have memories. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1816.88s)]
*  They have pretty long memories and they have a lot of reasons to be targeting Russia. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1818.68s)]
*  And so this is something that could continue to kind of creep into into Russia, creep into places like Chechnya, where obviously they've been pretty brutal and suppressing any any any dissent or any opposition. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1823.0400000000002s)]
*  But but this is it seems like this is part of the terrorist landscape for the foreseeable future. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1835.4s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I guess good news from a US or Western perspective is clearly the US did have some intelligence on these guys and the specific plot. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1840.4s)]
*  And they tried to warn the Russians, including, you know, privately telling their intelligence services under this duty to warn that the US intelligence community operates under where we've warned countries like Russia warned Iran about impending ISIS plots. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1846.8s)]
*  But it's still pretty scary. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1859.8s)]
*  You're right, though, that these guys are this focused on external plotting because, you know, not all terrorist groups are like that. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1861.48s)]
*  Some of them are just focused on, you know, a region or a country or a caliphate, in their words, but not ISIS. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1866.6s)]
*  And we should say like this in a world in which there's any information that reaches people in Russia, this should be profoundly embarrassing to Putin. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1872.8400000000001s)]
*  Literally, there was a warning on the US embassy website about ISIS attacks that are basically indicating terrorist attacks, which suggested ISIS at concert venues, you know, and he dismissed it publicly at the time. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1880.52s)]
*  Marked it, yeah. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1894.3999999999999s)]
*  And so, look, he may... [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1895.8s)]
*  The idea that these guys were going to go into Ukraine, too, as if that's an easy thing to do, as if it's easy to get from Moscow and cross like the front line into Ukraine, like none of that really made sense. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1898.56s)]
*  None, not at all. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1908.8799999999999s)]
*  His efforts to blame Ukraine look ridiculous. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1909.3999999999999s)]
*  I don't know that he can like escalate things against Ukraine, given what he's already doing there, which has been pretty bad the last few weeks with the attacks on the power grid. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1911.8s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1920.24s)]
*  I think this suggests some problems for Putin, but, you know, he'll react the way he does, which is just becoming more vicious at home, as we've talked about. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1921.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1929.1200000000001s)]
*  So changing gears here, Ben. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1929.52s)]
*  So let's talk about Hong Kong, where last week, the parliament unanimously passed a new security law called Article 23. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1930.56s)]
*  These are the following crimes that this law covers. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1938.1200000000001s)]
*  Treason, incitement to mutiny, insurrection, external interference, espionage and state secret theft and sabotage. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1941.16s)]
*  This new law comes on top of a previous national security law passed in 2020. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1948.8s)]
*  That one has been used to go after pro-democracy advocates. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1953.92s)]
*  Previous efforts to pass laws like this were often met with huge protests, dissent from within parliament, you know, pushback generally from the media. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1957.16s)]
*  But those voices have been steadily pushed out of the country. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1967.12s)]
*  They've been arrested. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1969.92s)]
*  They've been otherwise silenced. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1970.68s)]
*  Ben, I know you're just in Hong Kong. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1972.2s)]
*  How significant is Article 23 compared to these previous efforts to strangle what's left of democracy and how worried were people you talked to? [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1974.52s)]
*  Yeah, well, I was in Hong Kong for a couple of days and I actually did the pod. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1982.44s)]
*  And they were like, let's not cover this this week. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1988.24s)]
*  I didn't want to be the first guy to test this law, to be honest. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1990.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1995.16s)]
*  Which, by the way, kind of makes the point. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1995.76s)]
*  It sure does. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1998.2s)]
*  Which is why does this matter? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=1999.68s)]
*  Well, first of all, this is what something in Beijing is one for a very long time. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2001.84s)]
*  And the first effort to kind of pass these laws was all the way back in like 2003. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2005.96s)]
*  And each time they tried, there were all these protests and all these demonstrations. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2011.1599999999999s)]
*  So this is kind of the core of whether or not Hong Kong has, quote unquote, one country, two systems, whether they have their own separate system with their own kind of more relaxed approach to civil liberties. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2014.6399999999999s)]
*  And people might say, well, I thought this was dealt with. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2025.36s)]
*  I thought there are these national security laws passed a couple of years ago. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2027.3999999999999s)]
*  Those were passed by the Beijing government, right? [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2030.6399999999999s)]
*  This is the Hong Kong legislature and the Hong Kong chief executive passing this law. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2034.8799999999999s)]
*  Everything you need to know, this passed unanimously in the allegedly democratic legislature of Hong Kong. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2040.4799999999998s)]
*  We know that there's not unanimous opinion in support of these laws in Hong Kong, because just a couple of years ago, there were like hundreds of thousands of people protesting against exactly this. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2048.0s)]
*  So it really matters because this is the Hong Kong government aligning its approach to national security with the Communist Party in China. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2057.76s)]
*  This is them doing it unanimously, which is sending a message that there's no room for dissent. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2066.52s)]
*  There's a lot of ambiguity, Tommy, around this. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2072.0s)]
*  Like, what does it mean? [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2073.96s)]
*  What is treason? [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2075.32s)]
*  What's a what's a conversation that I can't have with a foreigner? [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2076.08s)]
*  What's a political activity I can engage in? [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2079.28s)]
*  What's speech I can engage in? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2081.8s)]
*  Like, is if I do something in private on my phone, is someone going to find out about it, put me in prison? [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2084.04s)]
*  The ambiguity is the point. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2089.2400000000002s)]
*  It's meant to have this kind of chilling effect so that there's like self-censorship. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2090.6400000000003s)]
*  And it's worked. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2094.84s)]
*  And, you know, the people that used to stand up to these things in the media, they're all in prison. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2095.6400000000003s)]
*  We talked about Apple Daily and the publisher of that, which was like the last remaining independent media voice. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2100.0s)]
*  Well, he's looking at the rest of his life potentially in jail. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2106.8s)]
*  So sadly, I think it's a sign that, you know, the Communist Party has kind of fully swallowed up any notion of Hong Kong having independence. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2110.3999999999996s)]
*  Now, there's still some differences. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2120.08s)]
*  It's a slightly different economic system. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2121.56s)]
*  And, you know, I know there's more English speaking in Hong Kong, but like for all intents and purposes, the vibe there is one that, you know, this is now a Chinese city. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2123.92s)]
*  And in the same way that Shanghai is, and there's not this kind of separate space for more freedoms. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2135.84s)]
*  Yeah. Incredibly sad when you think about the protest movement several years ago and how hopeful it felt at times. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2143.5600000000004s)]
*  But, you know, I'm sure Taiwan is watching and there are many others in the region. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2148.48s)]
*  Tommy, I had this surreal experience of flying from Hong Kong to Taipei, you know, and what's surreal about that is, you know, there's this kind of cloud, obviously, over Taiwan. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2152.32s)]
*  And you go there from Hong Kong and you're like, you see where the dilemma facing the Taiwanese, which is like, if we make a deal with China, we could end up, you know, like Hong Kong. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2163.6s)]
*  They could promise us one country, two systems. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2173.52s)]
*  But we know how that ends. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2175.6s)]
*  The roads. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2176.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, we don't make a deal with China. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2177.28s)]
*  We could get invaded. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2178.7200000000003s)]
*  And I just have a tremendous amount of sympathy and affinity for the Taiwanese trying to figure this out. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2179.92s)]
*  Yeah, me too. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2185.6800000000003s)]
*  Two big political resignations that we wanted to flag Ben. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2187.12s)]
*  The first is in Vietnam, where President Va Vung Tung stepped down last week for violating Communist Party regulations, which we don't totally know what it means, but it seems to mean corruption. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2190.16s)]
*  The position of the presidency in Vietnam, it's largely ceremonial. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2201.68s)]
*  The real power rests in the hands of the leader of the Communist Party. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2205.04s)]
*  But the president does represent Vietnam in meetings with foreign leaders. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2208.3999999999996s)]
*  And Vung Tung was seen as first in line to become the next party leader. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2213.04s)]
*  So it's a big change for him to get pushed out. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2216.7999999999997s)]
*  He's also the second Vietnamese president to resign in two years amidst a broader crackdown on corruption that dates back to 2016. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2219.36s)]
*  The second major resignation comes out of Ireland, where Prime Minister Leo Varadkar announces resignation. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2226.88s)]
*  Here's a clip from his speech. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2232.8s)]
*  I am resigning as president and leader of Finneagail effective today. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2234.32s)]
*  I will resign as Taoiseach as soon as my successor is able to take up that office. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2237.52s)]
*  My reasons for stepping down are both personal and political. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2241.84s)]
*  I promise I'll keep working for Ireland and my community in any way I can in the future. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2245.2799999999997s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2250.88s)]
*  So for those who don't know that in Ireland they call the prime minister the Taoiseach. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2252.64s)]
*  Varadkar was the first openly gay, the first multi-ethnic Taoiseach in history. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2256.24s)]
*  Successor will be a 37 year old guy named Simon Harris of the Finneagail party. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2260.64s)]
*  Then a lot of political analysts think Varadkar's resignation was tied to that recent failed effort we talked about to update Ireland's constitution, basically to make it less sexist. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2265.6s)]
*  But curious if you have thoughts on either these pretty significant changes. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2275.2s)]
*  Well, the Vietnam one, I mean, there's not a lot of turnover that, you know, usually in these jobs. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2278.56s)]
*  Like it's older people that have been around forever. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2284.0s)]
*  And so it does just speak to some volatility in the Communist Party, some maneuvering. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2287.2799999999997s)]
*  Obviously, corruption is both the real thing and something that people weaponize. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2292.64s)]
*  So, you know, this could be a generational change that's taking place. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2296.7999999999997s)]
*  It just bears watching there because obviously Vietnam is an increasingly important country. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2300.56s)]
*  And Ireland, you know, I think you're right. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2305.3599999999997s)]
*  I mean, I read about this a bunch as a friend of Ireland. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2307.04s)]
*  And it does just kind of feel like this guy was a little burned out. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2312.56s)]
*  But also that this constitutional referendum was just pretty mishandled, you know, kind of half ass. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2317.2s)]
*  It was just everybody involved in it kind of screwed up. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2324.24s)]
*  And, you know, he may have gotten to the point where, you know, he just wasn't throwing his fastball anymore. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2328.16s)]
*  And he's a relatively young guy, though. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2335.36s)]
*  He's already made a political comeback. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2337.04s)]
*  I just want to say, Tommy, like, don't you feel old when there's like some 37 year old taking over? [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2340.08s)]
*  It's outrageous. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2344.72s)]
*  Yeah, but I'm for it. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2346.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm glad it's happening. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2347.44s)]
*  It just makes me feel kind of I like it, but I hate it personally. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2348.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2350.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2351.7599999999998s)]
*  Sad to see him leave because he seemed like an exciting person. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2352.0s)]
*  I think we both knew people that knew Redker personally and were pressed by him. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2354.72s)]
*  I thought he was a good person. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2358.64s)]
*  So, yes, it just sucks to see good people leave politics. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2359.68s)]
*  Yeah, hopefully, you know, it might not be his last act, you know. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2362.64s)]
*  But you're right. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2366.16s)]
*  Like, there's something, you know, you keep seeing these younger people kind of burning out on politics pretty fast. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2366.88s)]
*  And let's hope that that's not that's not a permanent trend. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2372.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2376.32s)]
*  There was some good news at a Senegal, Ben. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2377.12s)]
*  On Monday, the incumbent president, Mackie Saul, conceded defeat to opposition leader Basiru Diumaifi. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2379.6s)]
*  He's a 44 year old former tax inspector who kind of came out of nowhere. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2387.2s)]
*  He had been arrested last year. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2392.4s)]
*  He was only released from prison on March 14th. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2393.92s)]
*  So it's pretty remarkable that this guy managed to win. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2395.84s)]
*  There was a lot of concern, though, that Senegal was about to go from a pretty stable democracy [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2398.16s)]
*  to the latest country in the region to involve victim to a coup or just, you know, a president that wouldn't leave. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2403.36s)]
*  So some good news here that we're going to have a democratic transition. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2408.48s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you know, Mackie Saul kind of reversed himself after saying he wasn't. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2411.6s)]
*  Well, several reversals after saying he wasn't going to run again. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2418.72s)]
*  He kind of made a power grab, but then let this go forward. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2423.36s)]
*  Bottom line is, it's a good thing that they had the election. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2428.96s)]
*  It's, you know, it's a good thing that, you know, Mackie Saul and the ruling party [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2433.2s)]
*  have agreed to abide by the results. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2438.56s)]
*  That's not something that happens with great frequency in that part of West Africa. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2441.2s)]
*  And again, assuming that holds, I think it's a real credit to Senegal that, you know, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2446.72s)]
*  their democracy is kind of holding that you can have this transition of power back and forth [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2451.28s)]
*  between political parties. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2456.2400000000002s)]
*  I would hope that the party that won doesn't seek retribution, but actually governs in that respect of [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2457.52s)]
*  the peaceful transfer of power. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2463.04s)]
*  And it shows it underneath the surface of these coups, which have a lot of factors behind them, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2465.04s)]
*  including some foreign interference, including a lot of frustration with, you know, [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2469.2799999999997s)]
*  usually the French colonial powers and corruption. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2473.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, the French basically. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2476.24s)]
*  Thanks for naming it. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2477.8399999999997s)]
*  There's a democratic culture that wants to assert itself. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2479.9199999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2482.64s)]
*  And so that's a good thing. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2482.8799999999997s)]
*  And we should we should celebrate that and note it. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2484.0s)]
*  Now, let's see what happens and let's hope that that continues and carries over into [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2486.3199999999997s)]
*  the new administration there. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2490.56s)]
*  But Senegal is a critically important country and and they're bucking the trend thus far. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2491.52s)]
*  And that's a good thing. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2497.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2498.72s)]
*  Speaking of democracy, asserting itself and recriminations for the past. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2499.28s)]
*  So listeners might remember that in January of twenty, twenty three, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2503.2s)]
*  Brazil faced its own sort of January six style insurrection when supporters of President Jair [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2506.72s)]
*  Bolsonaro stormed the federal government buildings in Brasilia, the capital, and just ransacked the [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2511.6s)]
*  place. Since that time, Bolsonaro has gotten out of office, but he has been hit with a bunch of [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2516.48s)]
*  criminal investigations for corruption, for falsifying vaccine records and potentially this [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2522.88s)]
*  coup plot. On Monday, the New York Times reported that four days after two of Bolsonaro's aides were [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2528.32s)]
*  arrested for plotting a coup, Bolsonaro himself sought sanctuary in the Hungarian embassy in [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2534.4s)]
*  Brazil, where he can't be arrested because the grounds are legally off limits. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2540.4s)]
*  The Times reviewed both security camera footage from this embassy building and satellite photos of [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2544.88s)]
*  the embassy grounds. You could see Bolsonaro's car still parked there for some of these days. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2551.52s)]
*  So he's since he's left and he's confirmed to the press that he was at the embassy, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2555.44s)]
*  but said he was just there to talk politics with Hungarian diplomats. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2559.52s)]
*  Or I guess, you know, you have a two day sleepover to talk politics. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2563.52s)]
*  But then we have talked a lot of times in the show about this weird nexus of right wing [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2566.56s)]
*  politicians. It's the US, it's Brazil, it's Victor Orban in Hungary, it's El Salvador. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2570.96s)]
*  But this one just like jumped out at me as next level because I mean, basically, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2576.8s)]
*  he was, you know, if anyone who's seen what lethal weapon movie was it like diplomatic community, [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2582.0s)]
*  the guy's like just trying to hide like Assange style in some embassy grounds. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2586.08s)]
*  It's like Julian Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2590.16s)]
*  Yeah. Well, previously Bolsonaro was just chilling in Orlando, Florida for about three months. I [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2591.92s)]
*  guess he got pushed out of there, but I don't know, just a weird story that was worth flagging. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2596.4s)]
*  Well, yeah, he was like, previously was like trying to like take a refuge in Mar-a-Lago, [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2599.44s)]
*  you know, and I have to say like that Orban play here, putting himself at the vanguard of this [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2603.2000000000003s)]
*  group of creepy right wing, you know, nationalists. It's really being quite validated. I mean, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2610.48s)]
*  he's got this kind of strange stature in the Star Wars bar of these far right guys. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2617.2000000000003s)]
*  But I think it just is yet another data point that we should keep pointing out that this really is [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2623.12s)]
*  a group of like-minded fellow travelers and it's a pretty big club and growing club. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2628.4s)]
*  And it's also like geographically diverse, right? So, you know, this is not just [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2634.2400000000002s)]
*  Orban going to CPAC and hanging out with American Republicans. It reaches down to Brazil, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2641.92s)]
*  it reaches, you know, into a bit into Argentina, reaches out to like the Philippines to like a [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2647.76s)]
*  deter-te. There's a global collection of very like-minded people invested in one another's [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2654.64s)]
*  success. And it's easy to laugh at and make fun of because it's funny and these people are [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2661.2s)]
*  somewhat ridiculous. But it's also quite serious because they're, you know, pretty politically [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2666.16s)]
*  viable and resilient. And a guy like Orban, he's kind of the Mussolini of the crowd, right? [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2671.3599999999997s)]
*  The first mover. And, you know, that's something that I think we should continue to call out. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2676.3199999999997s)]
*  Definitely. Two more quick stories. So last week, Ben, we discussed the [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2681.92s)]
*  huge proliferation of conspiracy theories surrounding Kate Middleton's [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2686.7200000000003s)]
*  disappearance. She hadn't been seen in public since December. We covered that story because [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2690.7200000000003s)]
*  Kensington Palace released this very obviously photoshopped picture of Kate and her family, [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2695.04s)]
*  which sent the internet into overdrive and sort of made it a story worth covering. On Friday, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2699.04s)]
*  Kensington Palace shared a video of Kate informing the public that she had been diagnosed with cancer [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2703.52s)]
*  following a planned abdominal surgery and that she is in the early stages of preventative [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2708.24s)]
*  chemotherapy. Here's a clip from that video. This, of course, came as a huge shock. And William and [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2712.4799999999996s)]
*  I have been doing everything we can to process and manage this privately for the sake of our [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2718.0s)]
*  young family. As you can imagine, this has taken time. It has taken me time to recover for major [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2723.2799999999997s)]
*  surgery in order to start my treatment. But most importantly, it has taken us time to explain [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2730.16s)]
*  everything to George, Charlotte and Louis in a way that's appropriate for them and to reassure [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2736.4s)]
*  them that I'm going to be OK. We hope that you'll understand that as a family, we now need some time, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2741.6800000000003s)]
*  space and privacy while I complete my treatment. So obviously we wish her the best scary, serious [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2748.4s)]
*  thing. And then I'm sure the internet will learn its lesson this time for good. Yeah, I mean, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2754.8s)]
*  the more obvious explanation for her absence was true, albeit the kind of worst case of those [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2760.4s)]
*  possibilities. And we still don't know exactly what her diagnosis is or Charles's is. I guess [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2768.56s)]
*  the only thing I have to add to this beyond this just being sad and it being yet another [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2774.2400000000002s)]
*  confirmation that internet conspiracy theories are. Tommy, whenever you hear or see in any coverage [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2779.12s)]
*  the term internet sleuth, I know that that's almost always a crowd source investigations [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2786.32s)]
*  or policing. It's like so every once in a while they get something right. But way more often than [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2792.32s)]
*  not, they absolutely screw over some innocent person in the worst possible way. In this case, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2797.36s)]
*  it was like accusing her husband of infidelity and accusing her of getting a Brazilian butt lift [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2801.84s)]
*  when really she was getting fucking chemotherapy. But yeah, it gets worse from there. Yeah. The only [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2805.76s)]
*  point I'd make, though, is like we joke about the world a lot ourselves and, you know, [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2811.1200000000003s)]
*  you feel bad about that when you see something like this. But the serious point is, [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2817.1200000000003s)]
*  I do think part of the problem is just it's not clear what this institution is anymore. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2822.1600000000003s)]
*  You know, and I'm not even saying that to be critical of the institution or certainly of [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2826.7200000000003s)]
*  Kate in this moment. It's just like, is it? What is it? You know, because I've seen all these [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2831.2000000000003s)]
*  debates of like, what should she have to share? Should you have to share what her diagnosis is? [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2837.04s)]
*  Or not. And again, this is not to put any of this on her particularly, or even Charles, [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2842.0s)]
*  for that matter. It's just we're in this weird place where do they have a political role? [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2847.28s)]
*  Is it a reality show? Like, I think part of like the strangeness of all this is just this kind of, [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2852.96s)]
*  it's just not clear anymore what the royal family is. The Queen somehow bridged this [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2858.48s)]
*  old era when they really were like, you know, the symbolic kind of head of state function. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2863.7599999999998s)]
*  Now it's not, I just don't know what the royal family is at this point. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2869.52s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2873.28s)]
*  And it, you know, we're, we're, we're kind of trying to figure that out. And that's, I think, [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2873.84s)]
*  part of why this is so weird. And I'm actually, I'm not defending the PR shop, because I saw a lot [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2878.4s)]
*  of people that were like, you know, trafficking and conspiracy theories, they came out and said, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2883.52s)]
*  well, I only did it to call out the PR shop at Buckingham Palace. Yeah, they could have done a [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2887.76s)]
*  better job, but like that's some people like leaning on that to be sympathetic to the PR [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2894.0s)]
*  shop. But what is their obligation? Is it to share the diagnosis? Is it to conceal everything? Like, [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2899.92s)]
*  I don't think anyone knows, you know, it is kind of this identity crisis. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2905.2000000000003s)]
*  I think that's a good, really good point. I mean, I do think like the PR shop obviously screwed up. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2908.88s)]
*  You can't, you know, you can't release a fake falsified. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2912.08s)]
*  No, they fucked up. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2915.2000000000003s)]
*  You know, and like that, that's just sort of like, I, that I think was about drove it into [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2916.96s)]
*  a real story for everyone. You know, you and I talked last week about how the AP had the photo [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2920.56s)]
*  up on its wire and had to issue a kill order and remove it. So like those sort of machinations [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2925.28s)]
*  are going to, you know, they're going to make news. I do think you're right though. I mean, [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2929.12s)]
*  not only did the queen kind of bridge, it was a by, she, she represented a bygone era in terms of [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2932.2400000000002s)]
*  the importance of the monarchy and the institution, but also of a difference of cultural era where you [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2936.64s)]
*  actually could kind of contain and manage the press. There wasn't like, you know, a popper [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2943.52s)]
*  every single person alive now as a pop is a paparazzi. We have iPhones and you can photograph [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2948.7999999999997s)]
*  them everywhere. And it's clear like from Harry's book that the Royals are not just victims of the [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2953.6s)]
*  media, but they are playing the game with the media and they have like reporters in their pox [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2959.2799999999997s)]
*  and they're giving them scoops. And now we all suspected that, but we know that. So it's like, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2964.08s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know that hearing, hearing Kate speak herself, I can't remember the last time [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2968.16s)]
*  I actually hurt her speak directly. I usually just hear people talk about the Royals. It was [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2972.4s)]
*  sort of jarring. I didn't know what her voice sounded like. Yes. Yeah. That's a good point. I [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2977.36s)]
*  mean, should we hear more from them or less from them? I mean, they need to figure this out. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2980.96s)]
*  And the Brits need to figure this out because right now you're right. Like it's just, [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2986.1600000000003s)]
*  it's just not clear. They're playing the game and they're victims of the game. And that, [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2990.0s)]
*  that's going to have to evolve to something different. That's a tough place to be. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2994.96s)]
*  Finally, Ben, I just wanted to thank the good people at PolitiFact for keeping us all honest. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=2998.48s)]
*  So on March 19th, PolitiFact released a fact check that said, quote, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3002.96s)]
*  no video of Clinton's engaging in cannibalism with Haitian gang leader, end quote. This apparently [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3007.44s)]
*  was in response to a tweet that claimed Mel Gibson had released a video of Bill and Hillary Clinton [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3012.96s)]
*  engaging in cannibalism with who else? A Haitian gang leader named barbecue. It's good that, you [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3018.16s)]
*  know, every, every good conspiracy theory needs to have an anti-Semite like Mel Gibson just kind of [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3023.52s)]
*  tucked in there. So then I know you are concerned about this one. And I just wanted to reassure you [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3027.52s)]
*  that Bill Clinton is still a vegan. We're good. Well, you know, internet sleuths have been like [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3031.44s)]
*  obsessed with conspiracy theories related to Bill Clinton in Haiti for a while. And like part of [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3037.76s)]
*  what you notice is how they just merge these narratives, right? There's a guy named barbecue [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3042.8s)]
*  that's kind of irresistible information on social media. There's something happening in Haiti. The [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3046.88s)]
*  Clintons must be involved. So let's put all this together and somehow it connects back to Mel [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3051.68s)]
*  Gibson. Of course it does. Of course it has to. Mel Gibson probably did internet sleuth this himself, [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3057.28s)]
*  you know? Yeah, I think you're right. You know, the weird thing is about this. I was in, when I went [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3061.36s)]
*  to Haiti like five days or whatever after the earthquake, at one point when I was down there, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3065.44s)]
*  Bill Clinton came down and I remember like he was doing, he was going to a hospital with like Dr. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3069.36s)]
*  Sanjay Gupta, I think it's like Tommy getting that like car, go with them right now to like manage the [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3075.0400000000004s)]
*  press. So I'm like, all right. So I go in. Oh, you went with Sanjay Gupta and Bill Clinton? Yeah. And so we were [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3080.7200000000003s)]
*  like driving through Port-au-Prince. It is like the place is just, you know, there's literally bodies [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3085.2s)]
*  in the streets still. It is like a disaster. We go to this hospital because they're trying to deliver [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3091.04s)]
*  some supplies. And I've never been more angry at an assembled press corps in my life because there's [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3094.3999999999996s)]
*  this like horde of people surrounding Clinton. And there's literally patients, not just like in a [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3101.52s)]
*  waving room, but there's people lined up on the sidewalk, like back to back to back to back to back, [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3107.12s)]
*  like hundreds and hundreds of feet of them, like, you know, in a row. And these reporters with [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3113.04s)]
*  cameras are like about to back into people who had lost limbs or like had like been crushed in some, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3118.48s)]
*  you know, horrible accident. I'm literally like shoving reporters as hard as I can, like to push [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3125.52s)]
*  them away from fucking like trampling people. And it was just like completely out of control, bizarre, [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3131.6s)]
*  wild situation. I think, you know, Clinton was just trying to like highlight the need for [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3137.04s)]
*  humanitarian relief to highlight the fact that I think his plane, I think they flew down there [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3142.88s)]
*  with a bunch of stuff to like deliver personally. But it was, it was one of those moments where I [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3147.44s)]
*  was like, this is weird and bad and demoralizing. And I don't know, I wish this hadn't happened. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3152.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's a, that's pretty dark and kind of says something about how like we look at Haiti, [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3157.2799999999997s)]
*  you know, which is the not seeing the actual people there, you know. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3162.32s)]
*  Yeah, that's a that's exactly right. Okay, we are going to take a quick break. When we come back, [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3166.56s)]
*  you'll hear Ben's interview with Bernie Sanders about what a better foreign policy could look [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3170.32s)]
*  like. So stick around for that. We are very pleased to welcome back to Pod Save the World, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3174.8s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Senator, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3180.48s)]
*  My pleasure. Thanks for having me. Okay, so there's obviously a lot to talk about. One of [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3184.96s)]
*  the things we want to get to is there's a article in Foreign Affairs that you wrote called a [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3188.96s)]
*  revolution in American foreign policy that we definitely recommend to everybody. I think a [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3194.8s)]
*  natural way into that conversation is obviously to start with Gaza, which is the most pressing issue [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3200.96s)]
*  that we're dealing with right now. And so I just want to start with you on Gaza. We've obviously [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3209.52s)]
*  seen a bit of an evolution in the situation from the administration, which originally did not want [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3215.04s)]
*  to have much public disagreement with Israel that kind of evolved into some public disagreement [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3219.84s)]
*  without necessarily a lot of consequences. We've now seen the administration and a real [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3224.96s)]
*  substantive public difference with Prime Minister Netanyahu over a UN Security Council resolution [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3230.4s)]
*  that they abstained on. They allowed to pass it called for an immediate ceasefire. I just wanted [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3236.08s)]
*  to start. You've been a very outspoken voice on this. What do you think is both necessary to [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3241.36s)]
*  try to impact Israel's strategy in Gaza? And what kind of leverage should be on the table [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3249.6800000000003s)]
*  for the United States given the intransigence of Prime Minister Netanyahu and his coalition government? [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3254.48s)]
*  Well, Ben, the leverage is obvious. We have provided Israel with tens of billions of dollars [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3260.2400000000002s)]
*  over many years. Just the other day against my vote, another $3.3 billion went to military aid [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3269.28s)]
*  for Israel. It is part of the supplemental bill, which is still being discussed. It's $14 billion [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3278.32s)]
*  more, including $10 billion more for unfettered military aid. So you want to talk about leverage? [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3285.36s)]
*  That's leverage. The idea that Israel is telling us what they're going to do at the same time as [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3291.2799999999997s)]
*  they're accepting our money is a bit absurd to me. When I look at the situation there right now, [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3298.64s)]
*  what is most important is that as we speak right now, hundreds of thousands of children [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3307.2s)]
*  are facing starvation, while at the same time, hundreds if not thousands of trucks are lined up [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3315.2s)]
*  to get into Gaza to deliver the humanitarian aid, and Israel is refusing to allow that. That is [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3323.2s)]
*  obscene. That is unacceptable. And a matter of fact, is in violation, as you know, of American [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3330.0s)]
*  law, because any country that bars American humanitarian aid should not be getting financial [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3336.64s)]
*  support from the United States. That's the law. One more question in Israel, because again, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3342.48s)]
*  it sets up something you do very well in your article, which is discuss what the underlying [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3346.96s)]
*  reasons are for some of the irrationality and hypocrisy in our foreign policy. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3352.48s)]
*  I guess one of the things that's frustrating in watching the situation play out in Gaza is that [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3358.32s)]
*  this has been evident for a while now. You're someone who sincerely, I think, felt the trauma [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3363.92s)]
*  that Israel experienced on October 7th was open to the idea that they needed to do something in [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3370.72s)]
*  response. But frankly, you also were pretty quick in realizing that this government, this Israeli [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3378.16s)]
*  government under Netanyahu, was not going about this in a thoughtful way and certainly was not [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3384.24s)]
*  going about this with much regard for the lives of Palestinians. And I guess my question to you is, [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3389.68s)]
*  for the last few months now, it's been pretty clear that this is harming American interests, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3396.4s)]
*  right? We're isolated in the world. It's harming the people of Gaza, and frankly, it's harming [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3401.6800000000003s)]
*  Israel. It's isolating the state of Israel from the rest of the world and frankly contributing, [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3405.52s)]
*  I think, to the ideology that Hamas relies on. And yet, as you said, there's this kind of autopilot, [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3412.32s)]
*  right? Where the military aid is still going out. I'm sure if this was a straight up and down vote [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3418.32s)]
*  in Congress tomorrow, they pass that military aid. Are people not aware of what's going on? Or is [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3425.2s)]
*  this, or is it AIPAC? Why is it that there seems to be so much, that Washington seems to be the [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3433.04s)]
*  last place on earth that is able to get its head around what's happening? Ben, well stated. And [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3442.72s)]
*  I sit in a room where it kind of blows my mind as to what is being discussed. Because you have, [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3449.36s)]
*  I mean, I think from the Republican perspective, it's 100% politics. They perceive that the Jewish [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3457.04s)]
*  vote historically has gone to Democrats. They have an opportunity now to seize some of that. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3463.6800000000003s)]
*  And that's their perspective. Although it really does, it really does get to me [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3469.52s)]
*  that not only are they 100% in support of Netanyahu, there is total disregard [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3475.44s)]
*  for the suffering and the starvation and the misery of the Palestinian people. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3483.84s)]
*  And that really gets to me. In terms of the Democratic caucus, I think if you talk to not [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3490.8s)]
*  just progressive members, but average members, they will tell you what's going on there is [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3497.52s)]
*  horrible. And more and more of them are speaking up about the number of civilian deaths, [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3502.72s)]
*  the destruction of military, of medical facilities. They are aware of it. And more and more of them [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3514.08s)]
*  are signing on to letters that are demanding the Biden administration do something. But there is [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3525.04s)]
*  something else that's going on. And that is that relatively few are prepared to pull the trigger and [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3532.08s)]
*  say, you know what? Hey, Mr. Netanyahu, you continue that. You're not getting another nickel [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3538.64s)]
*  in American aid. Why that's so? I guess it has a lot to do with AIPAC. It has a lot to do with [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3544.16s)]
*  the president, I think, who has been deeply emotionally committed to Israel for 40 years. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3550.48s)]
*  And I think to many people do not understand that the Israel of today is not the Israel of [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3556.0s)]
*  Golda Meir of 20 or 30 years ago. It is a right-wing country, increasingly becoming [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3561.44s)]
*  a religious fundamentalist country, where you have some of these guys in office believe that God told [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3568.8s)]
*  them they have a right to control the entire area. Not a whole lot different, by the way, [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3576.08s)]
*  than what Hamas is saying. So bottom line, Hamas committed a atrocity, in my view. Israel certainly [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3581.12s)]
*  had the right to defend itself, but it did not and does not have the right to go to war against [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3588.08s)]
*  the entire Palestinian people. Two thirds of the casualties and deaths of women and children, [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3593.44s)]
*  unacceptable. Do you see in the long run the capacity of the U.S. to, what do you, what is [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3599.04s)]
*  the outcome that you think we should be aiming for six months, one year, two years from now, [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3606.64s)]
*  assuming hopefully that we can bring the immediate suffering to some end and get assistance in? [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3613.12s)]
*  Well, the immediate concern is to feed starving people. And you know better than I do, Ben, this [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3618.08s)]
*  is something, a crisis that has gone on for 75 years. You've had five wars. You have had the [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3625.2s)]
*  leader, a leader of Egypt and a leader of Israel assassinated for the crime of trying to bring peace [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3634.0s)]
*  to the region. I mean, bottom line is Hamas is a terrorist organization. I don't think [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3640.72s)]
*  it wants to destroy Israel. I don't think you're going to have peace so long as they're in power. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3646.4s)]
*  I think clearly the Netanyahu government is right-wing extremists. I don't think you're [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3651.12s)]
*  going to have peace so long as they are in power. So hopefully the people of Israel will elect [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3656.4s)]
*  new leadership, which appreciates and understands as difficult as it may seem, the need for a two-state [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3664.08s)]
*  solution, or that the Palestinian people will get rid of leadership, which has a mentality that they [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3669.84s)]
*  must destroy Israel rather than pay attention to the economic and social needs of their own people. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3677.04s)]
*  Not easy stuff, but I think that's the direction that we've got to go. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3682.4s)]
*  Well, look, I want to get into your article, which again, I think is entirely consistent [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3686.88s)]
*  with this conversation we've been having. You really talk about the need to have a wholesale [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3692.32s)]
*  revolution and how America approaches foreign policy, the kind of group thing that we've seen [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3697.36s)]
*  out of Washington that has gotten us into wars, that has gotten us out of step with the public, [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3702.8s)]
*  that has tolerated extreme inequality and the kind of export of that inequality around the world, [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3708.56s)]
*  that requires a wholesale rethink. And I thought one way to enter into this conversation is, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3716.0s)]
*  you know, in a way there's an opportunity because Trump has kind of so scrambled the whole foreign [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3721.2s)]
*  policy debate, right? He wants to pull out NATO. He's also attacked trade agreements. He doesn't [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3727.68s)]
*  want to give any foreign assistance. He speaks against military interventions, although you point [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3732.72s)]
*  out in your piece that there was a lot of militarism in the first Trump term. Part of what's [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3737.68s)]
*  interesting though is he's kind of blown up this Republican kind of mindless hawkishness. I don't [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3742.4799999999996s)]
*  agree with the vast majority of his prescriptions or his impulses, but at the same time it's kind [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3747.44s)]
*  of interesting that a lot of Americans seem to be open to this either, if not his approach, [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3754.16s)]
*  certainly his critique. And so I wanted to ask you, how does this kind of scrambling of the [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3759.52s)]
*  traditional, you know, left-right divide on foreign policy or view of globalization, [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3766.48s)]
*  it should we see some opportunity as Democrats and progressives for more wholesale reform? [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3773.2s)]
*  I think so. And the reason I wrote the article is I hope we can do some [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3778.9599999999996s)]
*  fundamental rethinking of the groupthink and the status quo. What astounds me, let me just [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3785.68s)]
*  start off with the military industrial complex, which is a very important part of this. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3792.08s)]
*  Ben, we are spending $900 billion a year before the proposed $100 billion supplement on military [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3796.3199999999997s)]
*  spending. $900 billion a year. Do you think that there has been in Congress or within the American [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3805.7599999999998s)]
*  people serious discussion about whether we need to spend 10 times more than the next 10 nations? [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3813.36s)]
*  10 nations. And the answer is, no, there has not been. The budget passed the committee, [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3819.52s)]
*  the Armed Forces Committee, I think 22 to 1 or something like that. No serious discussion at all. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3825.76s)]
*  What role do the defense contractors play in shaping American foreign policy? Should we be [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3832.4s)]
*  concerned that the half a dozen or so major defense contractors are seeing record-breaking profits, [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3838.48s)]
*  that they have substantially raised prices for many of the arms that they're selling [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3846.3999999999996s)]
*  to the United States and around the rest of the world? Is that a discussion worth happening? [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3851.12s)]
*  Yeah, we talk about Ukraine, the need to protect Ukraine. Price of Stinger missiles has gone up by [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3855.68s)]
*  seven times. Ukraine is getting less help while these defense contractors are doing massive stock [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3861.44s)]
*  buybacks. Should we be discussing that? Yeah, I think maybe. And the other issue that we don't [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3868.0s)]
*  discuss is the role of global oligarchy. We talk about nation states. What's going on in the world? [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3873.04s)]
*  And what's going on in the world, unbelievably at a rapid rate, is the people on top, countries [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3880.56s)]
*  all over the world, including the United States, becoming much wealthier. You're seeing alliances, [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3886.32s)]
*  Elon Musk working with Saudi Arabia, et cetera, et cetera. Global alliances of the very rich and [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3891.68s)]
*  powerful, while the people at the bottom are suffering. So those are some of the issues that [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3897.84s)]
*  I think we need to bring to the table. And the other issue, of course, is the failure. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3904.8s)]
*  How has American foreign policy done in the last 50 years? Vietnam a great success? I don't think [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3912.0s)]
*  so. The war on terror a great success? I don't think so. But we continue to have the so-called [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3918.48s)]
*  bipartisan consensus, which is moving us in pretty bad ways. Again, listening to your talk [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3925.36s)]
*  and also reading this, I thought one of the things that's really interesting is there's the [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3932.2400000000002s)]
*  question of just people making bad decisions, people getting us into war on terror, people [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3936.7200000000003s)]
*  deciding to invade Iraq. But then there are these structural issues, right? The military industrial [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3941.2000000000003s)]
*  complex, which leads to enormous defense expenditures, but also a lot of incentive to go to war. And [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3946.6400000000003s)]
*  they fund a lot of think tanks. You've got the kind of fossil fuel industrial complex, [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3953.6s)]
*  which makes it harder to lead on international climate. You've got APAC, which makes it harder [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3957.2799999999997s)]
*  to have a rational approach to Israel, Palestine. You've got the Chamber of Commerce, it was pushing [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3961.36s)]
*  trade agreements, free trade agreements. How much of this is about different ideas and think tanks [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3967.92s)]
*  and different policy papers, but how much of this is actually just about kind of reforming the wiring [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3976.0s)]
*  of influence in our government to get better outcomes? Well, I think it obviously is, [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3981.2s)]
*  and it has to do with money. I mean, let's not be naive about it. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3986.3199999999997s)]
*  As I mentioned, the military industrial complex is making record-breaking profits. Oil industry [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=3993.4399999999996s)]
*  is in the process of destroying the planet, and they're doing extremely well. And I think it's [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4000.96s)]
*  time to really ask ourselves, what is the purpose of foreign policy? Do we really believe in democracy [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4010.4s)]
*  or are we allied with people like MBS in Saudi Arabia, who is a monarch, who treats women as [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4017.92s)]
*  third-class citizens, who really mistreats immigrant labor there and so forth and so on? [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4025.36s)]
*  What are our values and how do they manifest themselves in our foreign policy? Those are [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4030.96s)]
*  questions I think we don't discuss anywhere near enough. But to your point, if we're going [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4036.24s)]
*  to bring about real change in our foreign policy, create a democratic foreign policy, [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4041.52s)]
*  a foreign policy that is working for peace, not war, a foreign policy that is working [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4046.72s)]
*  on behalf of American workers and workers all over the world, we need fundamental changes. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4051.6s)]
*  You talk about this idea of solidarity too. When you look out at the world, [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4057.36s)]
*  I think you and I share a bit of a concern about when our partners are people like MBS, [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4063.6000000000004s)]
*  or obviously when we don't stand up to a BB-9 now, who should we be in solidarity with? Who are the [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4070.32s)]
*  partners that the US should be looking for, whether they're in governments or whether they're outside [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4076.88s)]
*  of governments, as we think about in a world where there's China and Russia and their access [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4080.48s)]
*  and then there's the kind of Elon Musk, kleptocracy and oligarchy in the world. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4086.48s)]
*  Who are the partners that you think a small d democratic foreign policy should seek in the [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4090.64s)]
*  world? Well, this is not easy stuff, as you all know. If I had all the answers, I'd [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4094.96s)]
*  let you know immediately. I don't. But I think we have to stress what are our values. You're going [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4101.92s)]
*  back to the trade policies, which I vigorously oppose. What really galled me [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4108.08s)]
*  is we fought the war in Vietnam because the communists were so terrible and so horrible. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4115.92s)]
*  A few years later, there were trade agreements exploiting the cheap labor in Vietnam and in the [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4124.0s)]
*  process shutting down thousands of factories in the United States of America, creating massive [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4129.6s)]
*  political discontent, which, by the way, helped elect Donald Trump. So we lost 59,000 young men [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4135.76s)]
*  in Vietnam. Millions of Vietnamese people died because we hated the communists. And then a few [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4142.96s)]
*  years later, we're doing trade agreements and corporations are doing just fine. How's that? [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4149.12s)]
*  How ugly is that? So I think to answer your question, it's not easy. And you've got to think [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4154.0s)]
*  long term. You've got to think short term. Long term, what are our values? Our values is, [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4160.72s)]
*  I believe you believe in democracy. So we want to work with those forces around the world [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4164.88s)]
*  that are prepared to allow for governments that are democratically elected. And clearly on that [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4173.68s)]
*  issue, we have a former president who does not believe in democracy. His allies will be [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4180.88s)]
*  not only Putin, but right wing governments and right wing movements all over the world. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4188.0s)]
*  And by the way, let me say this. If Trump, God forbid, is elected, I think then you might be [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4194.0s)]
*  thinking about the end of the 250 year experiment in modern democracy. I mean, not just in America, [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4203.04s)]
*  but all over the world. It's Bolsonaro and Brazil and so forth, all around the world. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4211.44s)]
*  So we've got to be talking about what our values are. We have got to be talking about [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4218.48s)]
*  how we develop agreements. I remember when I was a kid, and I'm a little bit older than you, [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4226.32s)]
*  and I remember seeing the TV programs and the movies where poor people around the world [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4233.04s)]
*  received packages from the people of the United States. You remember that? [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4238.32s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4242.88s)]
*  I want that. I want poor people around the world to know that we are on their side. I want [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4243.759999999999s)]
*  governments in the developing world to know that we are on the side of their people who can't [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4251.36s)]
*  afford prescription drugs that save their lives rather than the pharmaceutical industry that is [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4257.599999999999s)]
*  denying them those drugs. That's what I would like for a start. I want the United States to say, [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4263.36s)]
*  we are concerned about world poverty, children dying from easily cured diseases, children dying [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4268.4s)]
*  from hunger. That's not what America stands for. We're going to work with those governments, [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4275.6s)]
*  and we're going to support international organizations. It's too obvious a statement [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4280.48s)]
*  to repeat. War is horrible. This is the year 2024. We should be talking about how we eliminate war [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4285.92s)]
*  in the world through international organizations, not cutting funding for UNWA, but strengthening [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4293.36s)]
*  the UN and other international organizations. That's some of what we should be doing. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4299.2s)]
*  Yeah. It strikes me, listening to you, that we are in some ways in this kind of competition with [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4303.12s)]
*  China and Russia and these countries that have an alternative world order in mind. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4310.24s)]
*  We've had trouble even in the Biden administration connecting with countries in the global south, [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4316.88s)]
*  like Brazil, like South Africa, in part because we don't seem to be talking to them about what [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4322.08s)]
*  they're interested in. I know you've traveled, you know Lula, you've traveled globally, you know the [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4328.5599999999995s)]
*  international labor movement, you've interacted with civil society. Do you think that there can [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4334.08s)]
*  be an agenda from the United States that can put us on the right side of those countries in the [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4338.0s)]
*  global south again? Ben, what do you think it would mean to the world if the president of the [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4342.0s)]
*  United States or the secretary of state goes to the developing world, goes to Brazil, goes to [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4349.12s)]
*  South Africa and say, you know what, we are developing life-saving drugs, for example, [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4354.48s)]
*  and I talk about drugs, come on the committee that deals with that. You can't afford those [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4361.12s)]
*  drugs right now. Well, you know what? Under my administration, everybody in this world is going [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4365.04s)]
*  to be able to get the vaccines and the life-saving drugs they need because we understand that all [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4370.0s)]
*  children are created equally. What do you think that would mean? What signal would that send to [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4375.76s)]
*  the entire world on whose side we are on? I think it would be profound and I think that's what, you [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4380.64s)]
*  know, the United States of America is not going to let children start to death, not in Gaza, not [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4386.96s)]
*  anyplace else in the world. I mean, that's good foreign policy. It's morally right. It's good [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4391.360000000001s)]
*  foreign policy. Yeah, and I guess, you know, I mean, this begins to bring us back to where we started, [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4397.12s)]
*  but, you know, do you think that there's a capacity to understand, you know, and I'll be [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4402.32s)]
*  honest with you, Senator, like, you know, I obviously like you have a lot of regard for the [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4412.719999999999s)]
*  Biden administration and friends and a lot of people in it. And yet, you know, when you hear [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4417.04s)]
*  them talk about a rules-based order and then you see our Gaza policy and you look at it from the [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4422.4s)]
*  outside in, you know, you see why it's not even I don't lay this on the feet of the Biden [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4428.56s)]
*  administration either. I was in the Obama administration. We had this kind of relationship [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4434.160000000001s)]
*  with a number of governments, not just Israel. It seems like the bar is higher than us to kind of [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4437.76s)]
*  purge the hypocrisy that, you know, we kind of got away with this for some time at the end of the [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4445.92s)]
*  Cold War because we were so much more powerful than other countries, but the margin of error [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4450.320000000001s)]
*  where we can have that the degree of hypocrisy that is on display in Gaza, [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4454.0s)]
*  we need to start seeing those issues as connected to this broader agenda, right? I mean, we can't [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4458.88s)]
*  carry around this hypocrisy the same way we have in the past. Ben, let me give you one example, [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4464.0s)]
*  and I agree with you. Absolutely. What Putin is doing, has done and is doing in Ukraine is [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4469.28s)]
*  outrageous. And yet how can the United States condemn with a straight face Putin's bombing [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4478.5599999999995s)]
*  of apartment buildings and killing children? How do you say this is a terrible thing? Really? [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4488.16s)]
*  Compared to what? Compared to the destruction that's going on in Gaza where we turn a blind eye? [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4493.2s)]
*  Oh, so you're right. I think we have to end the hypocrisy. And I think, look, you know, [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4500.08s)]
*  we haven't even begun to talk about climate change and future pandemics. You tell me [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4508.799999999999s)]
*  how this planet is going to be habitable and healthy for future generations if we don't [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4515.12s)]
*  deal with climate change. How do you deal with climate change if we're not dealing with China? [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4520.08s)]
*  How do you deal with future pandemics if you're not dealing globally? How do you do that? Really? [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4525.68s)]
*  Pandemics don't stop at the country's border. Climate change is going to wreck China. It's [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4532.4800000000005s)]
*  going to wreck the United States. All right. So we have to save ourselves and the world. We've [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4536.88s)]
*  got to work in a cooperative, much more cooperative way. So the last question for you then is if you've [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4544.400000000001s)]
*  outlined, I think, a policy that makes very good sense, right? And the elements of that policy, [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4549.52s)]
*  too, are fighting climate change, fighting kleptocracy, protecting democracy, which is [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4555.52s)]
*  obviously deeply imperiled, finding solidarity with other people around the world who are doing [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4561.68s)]
*  these things, avoiding wars and being open to engagement. It all sounds like kind of what we [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4566.400000000001s)]
*  need and also probably more popular than the kind of group think that emanates from Washington. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4573.4400000000005s)]
*  You've been at the center of American politics for a long time, but especially the last decade plus. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4579.280000000001s)]
*  And you've already seen in the domestic policy side ideas that you've kind of brought into the [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4585.52s)]
*  mainstream, the Democratic Party. Is it your sense that the Democratic Party under President Biden, [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4591.12s)]
*  under future leadership, is ready for this kind of this degree of a shift politically in how it [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4596.56s)]
*  thinks about foreign policy? Again, you've done a lot of this on the domestic side. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0bsijpVEc&t=4603.36s)]
