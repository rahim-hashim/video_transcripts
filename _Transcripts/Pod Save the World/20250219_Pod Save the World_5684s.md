Video Description: Tommy Vietor and Ben Rhodes discuss the seismic shift in US foreign policy that happened this past week after Trump announced that the US and Russia would directly negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine through talks that exclude Ukraine and Europe. They also explain how JD Vance’s first foreign trip insulted nearly every leader in Europe while boosting Germany’s far-right AfD party ahead of Germany’s election this Sunday, how support for a crypto scam has become a major political liability for the president of Argentina, the continued fallout from USAID cuts, the latest on the Gaza ceasefire, and intelligence leaks about a potential Israeli military strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities. Then, Ben speaks to Max Seddon, Moscow Bureau Chief for the Financial Times, about how the flip flop in US foreign policy towards Russia is being greeted by the Kremlin.

*  The German far-right ahead of their election next week and we'll update you on the far-right in Austria just for fun [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=77.58s)]

*  You did our interview a little bit earlier today. What are we in here? Yeah for a long time world [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=105.74000000000001s)]
*  Those you might remember Max Seddon who is the Moscow bureau chief for the Financial Times not currently in Moscow for obvious reasons [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=109.86s)]
*  Max was on a bunch at the beginning of the full-scale war in Ukraine. So we had him on to talk about how the Russians are [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=117.14s)]
*  Digesting this swing in American foreign policy [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=124.86s)]
*  How they're seeing things [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=129.82s)]

*  how Russia might have further ambitions in Europe or in the former Soviet space in this new world of [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=136.85999999999999s)]
*  Carved up spheres of influence with the United States [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=146.66s)]
*  So as usual Max is a very smart take on on just what the Russian side of all this is so everything we're about to talk [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=149.06s)]
*  about [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=156.26s)]
*  Max as an expert in a reporter was able to kind of fill in [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=157.22s)]
*  Here's how Putin might be seeing things here how the Russians are seeing things so people should definitely check it out [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=160.38s)]
*  Yeah, the sound of champagne corks popping must be basically. Yeah, Max's head was spinning as I was talking to him [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=165.02s)]
*  It's hard to get your mind around what's happening right now wild. Okay. Well, here's the backstory and all this [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=170.82s)]
*  So last week President Trump called Putin to discuss the war in Ukraine [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=175.06s)]
*  They then announced via like Twitter readouts that the USA and Russia are gonna hold a series of bilateral peace talks about the war [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=179.66s)]
*  Trump said this could ultimately include a Putin visit to the US and maybe Trump going to Moscow [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=186.72s)]
*  But the call itself effectively ended, you know [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=192.2s)]
*  three years of Western isolation of Putin and the Russians after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=194.92000000000002s)]
*  and neither this call [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=200.92000000000002s)]
*  nor the diplomatic process that Trump and Putin agreed to [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=203.52s)]
*  Included a role for Ukraine or for the Europeans earlier today Secretary of State Marco Rubio [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=206.96s)]
*  National security advisor Mike waltz in Trump's special envoy to the Middle East Steve Wittkopf [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  Held the first round of these talks in Saudi Arabia and then I do want to plant a flag [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=218.32s)]
*  Right here now and say that that is that is too many senior people in big egos for one set of negotiations [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=222.6s)]
*  I think they are going to knife each other. Yes. Yeah [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=228.12s)]
*  Well, it also the Middle East envoy being in the Russia talks is interesting. Yeah, it goes to show how [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=231.52s)]
*  Arbitrary the Trump foreign policy team is gonna be in terms of who does what role [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=236.92000000000002s)]
*  That's a really good point and not there was Keith Kellogg who was supposed to be in charge of diplomacy around this war [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=240.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  So we do I mean we talked about that with max a bit [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=247.44s)]
*  But the key point is that the Russians didn't want Kellogg in the talks because Kellogg had been pretty hawkish [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  You know, we talked about on this podcast Kellogg was giving Fox News interviews [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=256.88s)]
*  Which Trump surely saw about the need to escalate, you know ramp up weapons to Ukraine to put them to stronger position heading in negotiations [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=260.12s)]
*  The Russians are like, yeah, we don't like that guy [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=268.48s)]
*  So the Russians kind of selected [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=270.92s)]
*  Who they want to negotiate with which is never what you want in a situation like that and you know [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=273.32s)]
*  Send Kellogg to what is literally the kids table to Trump, which is Europe and Ukraine [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=278.6s)]
*  So I don't think Keith Kellogg is gonna be calling the shots here. No, so Rubio waltz Wiccaff [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=283.24s)]
*  They met in Saudi Arabia with cert a lab rob and Yuri Ushakov top top like [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=288.24s)]
*  foreign policy officials with Putin [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=294.56s)]
*  Here's a quick clip of Rubio speaking in Riyadh about these talks for three and a half years while this conflict is raged or three [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=296.6s)]
*  Years while it's raged. No one else has been able to bring something together like what we saw today [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=304.08s)]
*  Because Donald Trump is the only leader in the world that can so no one is being sidelined here [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=308.88s)]
*  But President Trump is in a position that he campaigned on to initiate a process that could bring about an end of this conflict [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=313.12s)]
*  And from that could emerge some very positive things for the United States for Europe for Ukraine for the world [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=318.96s)]
*  But first it begins by the end of this conflict and so the only thing President Trump trying to do is bring about peace [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=324.6s)]
*  It's what he campaigned on it's something the world should be thanking President Trump for doing [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=329.76s)]
*  He was able he's been able to achieve what for three two and a half three years [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=333.56s)]
*  No one else has been able to achieve which which is to bring [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=337.52000000000004s)]
*  To begin this process a serious process [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=340.76s)]
*  Obviously a lot of work remains before we have a result [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=343.88s)]
*  I think President Trump's the only one that can do it [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=346.44s)]
*  He almost says bring the two parties together, but then he realizes no they didn't even try to do that [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=348.40000000000003s)]
*  Yes, the US and Russia in the room [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=352.08s)]
*  So this is obviously the beginning of a long process and Russia [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=353.4s)]
*  I don't think is really incentivized to move quickly because they can just bleed Ukraine dry at this point [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=355.62s)]
*  But according to a report in Fox News what was discussed today in Riyadh was a three-stage plan that includes a ceasefire [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=359.4s)]
*  Elections in Ukraine and then a final peace agreement Ukraine is there operating under this martial law declaration? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=367.2s)]
*  Zelensky I think understandably says he can't hold an election in the middle of a war [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=373.59999999999997s)]
*  Fighting to end to safely hold an election [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=377.64s)]
*  So this US demand that Ukraine hold new elections is pretty shocking agreed to with Russia [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=380.28s)]
*  I mean just think about that. Yeah, the US and Russia agreeing that Ukraine has told an election without talking to Ukrainians about it [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=386.28s)]
*  That is wild. I mean, yeah, the fighting is ongoing Putin's hardly a democratically elected leader [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=392.44s)]
*  There's a pretty recent history of the Russians intervening in meddling in Ukrainian elections [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=397.32s)]
*  So yeah, it's all a mess all of this happens [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=402.11999999999995s)]
*  These talks in Riyadh happened a couple days after Pete Hegseth gave a speech in Brussels at NATO where he said it was unrealistic [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=404.52s)]
*  For Ukraine to ever join NATO or get back to the territory [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=411.08s)]
*  They lost since 2014 Trump kind of they tried to walk back the Hegseth speech then they walked back the walk back [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=413.84s)]
*  So it doesn't matter then let's pause there [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=419.79999999999995s)]
*  It's like we should not be surprised that these talks are happening given what Trump said [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=422.35999999999996s)]
*  He was gonna do in the election, but it is still like we started. This is a seismic shift in [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=426.34s)]
*  US foreign policy there are global repercussions [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=432.12s)]
*  It comes after JD Vance went to Germany and effectively told the Europeans to fuck off [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=434.91999999999996s)]
*  We'll get to that in a minute [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=439.44s)]
*  But what did you make of like the talks in Saudi Arabia that you've seen in the proposals that have leaked out so far? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=440.64s)]
*  Yeah, I mean we'll we'll get to the European piece of this and and and some of my experience in Munich [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=446.03999999999996s)]
*  But this is not just a change from three years of US foreign policy. It's a change from 75 years of US foreign policy [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=450.68s)]
*  This is the United States like overnight like we've been talking about rug pulls Tommy [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=456.86s)]
*  In the crypto context another one coming up. This is a rug pull underneath Ukraine and the entire continent of Europe, which is talked to with them [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=461.64s)]
*  Yeah, we're just accustomed, you know to the United States being a guarantor of European security [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=468.76s)]
*  That was founded for two purposes one to defeat the Nazis and now we're for the Nazis [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=474.64s)]
*  We'll get to that with JD Vance and two was to kind of fortify Europe against the Soviet Union and then Russia and that appears [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=479.68s)]
*  To be gone. You cannot overstate [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=486.08s)]
*  What a dramatic shift this is in the US position [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=488.88s)]
*  It's absolutely absurd to think that you're negotiating the end of a war with only one of the parties of the war [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=493.03999999999996s)]
*  The Ukrainians have lost tens of thousands of people [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=500.29999999999995s)]
*  Many more injured many more displaced [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=503.88s)]
*  Over the last three years and they were the ones invaded and they don't get to be at the talks and the Europeans are the ones [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=507.08s)]
*  That have been supplying the weapons with us [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=512.88s)]
*  In larger numbers if you add up the total number of weapons plus member states [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=515.16s)]
*  Yeah [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=519.6s)]
*  so we're just essentially saying our allies our friends and the people that were invaded are not allowed to [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=519.92s)]
*  Participate in the peace talks that we're having with Russia [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=526.64s)]
*  that when you listen to the talks seem to also be about like oil and [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=529.56s)]
*  Natural resources and you know Rubio's talking about China [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=535.04s)]
*  It's absolutely an insane I mean I would have expected you some kind of talks obviously given what Trump said [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=538.9200000000001s)]
*  But I actually would have assumed that the Ukrainians might be invited to the talks, you know, right? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=546.6s)]
*  So to cut them out takes alone for optics alone to cut them out entirely is so [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=551.72s)]
*  Extreme and and so punitive to the Ukrainians who did nothing wrong here [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=556.8800000000001s)]
*  They're the ones invaded that it's hard to even get your mind around that. That's the first thing [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=560.6800000000001s)]
*  Would you want to hear Trump's response when he was asked what he says to Ukrainians who feel disappointed? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=565.8s)]
*  They were not part of these talks [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=571.16s)]
*  He's also asked in the same clip about whether the US supports this Russian push for new elections in Ukraine [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=572.16s)]
*  Let's listen, you know, there's upset about not having a seat [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=577.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, they've had a seat for three years and a long time before that. This could have been settled very easily just a half [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=580.04s)]
*  half-baked [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=587.48s)]
*  Negotiator could have settled this [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=589.2s)]
*  years ago [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=591.3199999999999s)]
*  Without I think without [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=592.8s)]
*  The loss of much land very little land [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=594.56s)]
*  Without the loss of any lives and without the loss of cities that are just laying on their sides [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=597.4799999999999s)]
*  You have those magnificent golden domes [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=603.4399999999999s)]
*  That are shattered will never be replaced. You can't replace them. Well, we have a [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=606.12s)]
*  Situation where we haven't had elections in Ukraine [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=613.0s)]
*  Well, we have martial law essentially martial law in Ukraine [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=616.64s)]
*  Where the leader in Ukraine, I mean I hate to say it but he's down at 4% approval rating and [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=621.1600000000001s)]
*  Where a country has been blown to smithereens and they want to seat at the table [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=627.44s)]
*  You could say the people have to [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=631.2s)]
*  Wouldn't the people of Ukraine have to say like, you know, it's been a long time since we've had an election [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=633.36s)]
*  That's not a Russia thing. That's something coming from me and coming from many other countries also [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=638.4000000000001s)]
*  So those from a press conference Tuesday at the White House [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=644.0s)]
*  I mean every time he talks about this he blames Ukraine for getting invaded and not ending a war [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=646.6s)]
*  They didn't start the only passion in his voice for the golden domes and like the destruction or obstruction of architecture [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=651.8000000000001s)]
*  It's it's I don't know. It's shocking. I [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=659.5600000000001s)]
*  Really don't want to go full 2017 [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=663.96s)]
*  I know Tommy [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=666.36s)]
*  But the reality is it if you were sitting in the basement of the Kremlin like a year ago and you're like what is the [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=667.12s)]
*  Absolute best-case scenario it would be a president states [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=672.72s)]
*  Echoing Russian misinformation that it's somehow Ukraine's fault that the war started that they missed all these opportunities to avoid the war when they were just [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=677.1999999999999s)]
*  repeatedly invaded and in what what sovereign country is gonna say [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=684.4s)]
*  We're gonna preemptively give up bunch of territory to stop you from invading us. Like it makes no sense [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=689.12s)]
*  So [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=696.24s)]
*  This is to a tee what the Russians would want if you look at the Hegseth comments [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=697.36s)]
*  The key elements of the negotiation the key things that Ukraine would have to concede our territory that Russia currently holds and [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=703.4000000000001s)]
*  No, NATO membership. Some people may say well inevitably the negotiations gonna end up there [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=710.32s)]
*  Well, you don't publicly concede those things at the beginning of the negotiations [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=714.96s)]
*  The art of the deal baby and so everything I heard in Munich was essentially this was the most catastrophic NATO meeting [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=718.5600000000001s)]
*  Anybody could remember because this they didn't preview that with anybody they didn't say hey [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=724.4s)]
*  We're just gonna go right for the end of the negotiation by making the concessions up front [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=729.1999999999999s)]
*  They didn't talk to the Ukrainians about it who will have to agree by the way. I mean the Ukrainians don't have to [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=733.68s)]
*  Agree, they're they're a warring party. And so at some point actually the danger is that you're not bringing along the Ukrainians [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=739.0799999999999s)]
*  They could just decide to fight a guerrilla war forever, you know [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=745.64s)]
*  Yeah [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=749.18s)]
*  This idea of Ukraine the Zalensky being at 4% that that's nonsense. There's never been a poll that shows that [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=750.38s)]
*  I mean his approval rating may be slipping a bit [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=755.38s)]
*  But he's nowhere near what Trump says the Russians have every interest in wanting some totally destabilizing election that polarizes Ukrainian politics [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=757.34s)]
*  Even Zelensky's opponents like Poroshenko the previous president has said I don't think there can be a [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=765.9s)]
*  election in this context [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=772.62s)]
*  So this is you know [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=774.26s)]
*  Russian play to further destabilize Ukraine [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=776.02s)]
*  Maybe try to get some Russian backed candidate to kind of be a disruptive force in the election itself [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=778.22s)]
*  Everything about this makes no sense [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=784.22s)]
*  And then even if you look at that table like Sergey Lavrov has been the Russian foreign minister like my [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=786.22s)]
*  You know, he's been there forever [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=792.22s)]
*  You got Mike waltz who was elected to the House of Representatives in 2016. This guy is in over his head [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=794.7s)]
*  Let's just name it Marco Rubio if if any other Democratic president was doing anything like this [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=800.98s)]
*  He'd be like lighting himself on fire in the Senate floor. Oh, yeah, he's mr. Russia hawk now all of a sudden [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=807.3000000000001s)]
*  He's telling us all we should be thanking Trump. Wait Ben. Let me read you a tweet from Marco Rubio in [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=812.54s)]
*  2022 many in the West still don't understand that Putin is an expert liar [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=818.62s)]
*  He doesn't care about humanitarian relief [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=821.84s)]
*  In fact, there's a ceasefire it is because he sees some strategic or tactical benefit and beware of attacks on refugees [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=823.58s)]
*  Russia blames on Ukraine or NATO that was from March 9th 2022. He knows better [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=828.7800000000001s)]
*  How is anybody gonna take this guy seriously? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=833.0600000000001s)]
*  If you sell your soul that hard that you do a complete 180 degree shift on the most important [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=835.1400000000001s)]
*  geopolitical issue in the world arguably [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=842.1400000000001s)]
*  You're just not like the Sergey Lavrov is gonna like look at that guy as if he's tiny little Marco disposable [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=844.46s)]
*  He's just totally disposable. He's totally afraid of Trump and then leaves nothing there [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=850.74s)]
*  There's also this telegraph report that the Trump people pass Zelensky like basically a demand letter [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=854.5999999999999s)]
*  That said that the US would get 50% of its recurring revenues from natural resources meaning like [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=860.0s)]
*  minerals rare earths and seemingly maybe [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=865.4399999999999s)]
*  fossil fuels and it was described as [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=868.92s)]
*  That Trump's demands would amount to a higher share of Ukrainian GDP than reparations imposed on Germany at the Versailles Treaty [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=872.9599999999999s)]
*  For being invaded for being and so we're basically telling a country that we've been [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=880.52s)]
*  Helping stay alive after being invaded that they have to give us all of their wealth [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=885.0799999999999s)]
*  To what to be invited to the negotiating table on how they're going to have their country dismembered and never have a security guarantee [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=890.2399999999999s)]
*  From the United States. I mean this is cruel [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=898.0799999999999s)]
*  Stuff and and I think to understand it to pull back the lens here and you and I were talking about this earlier [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=901.4s)]
*  You know what Putin believes in is that there are certain big powers that matter in the world [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=907.24s)]
*  That have kind of spheres of influence where they can do whatever the fuck they want and those powers by the way don't include Europe [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=911.44s)]
*  it's the United States and Russia and China basically and and then maybe you know the Saudis Emiratis just because they have a lot of [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=917.0s)]
*  money and [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=923.6s)]
*  That's the world that Trump likes, you know, he doesn't care about allies. He doesn't care about democracies [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=924.8000000000001s)]
*  He fundamentally believes in the highly transactional world in which if he can get some oil licenses from Russia [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=929.48s)]
*  He can literally run a bus over not just Ukraine but all of Europe in the process [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=935.88s)]
*  And the only thing that might keep him from kind of running the bus back and forth over and over again is if [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=940.04s)]
*  Ukraine signs off all their mineral wealth to the United States [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=945.3599999999999s)]
*  It's absolutely grotesque and it's a recipe for like a complete unraveling of any kind of international order [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=948.0799999999999s)]
*  that has any regard for [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=955.64s)]
*  human life for right and wrong for [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=958.8s)]
*  alliances for [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=961.9599999999999s)]
*  Democracy and we all knew this was possibly coming [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=963.36s)]
*  I will say the people that thought you know, maybe the madman theory would work. You know, like this is not the madman theory [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=967.12s)]
*  This is a guy that just doesn't give a shit [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=973.6800000000001s)]
*  well, and also forcing the Ukrainians to cut a deal with Russia that you kind of [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=975.48s)]
*  Makes them not really a country anymore and then us demanding all of their mineral wealth [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=980.5600000000001s)]
*  That is like a yelta like just dividing over the country in some ways and and to your point about Europe [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=984.6800000000001s)]
*  They were completely blindsided by this like they tried to walk back Hegseth's comments about no NATO membership and not returning all the territory [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=990.12s)]
*  But he was repeating he's reading prepare for me. Yeah, you know, it's like this wasn't like a flub [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=998.0s)]
*  This wasn't a gaffe. So Macron tries to pull together this emergency meeting of European leaders to figure out how to respond. It doesn't work [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1002.1600000000001s)]
*  It's a complete flop [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1009.36s)]
*  so I guess the UK and France expressed willingness to include some sort of [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1010.1600000000001s)]
*  Troop presence from both countries in a post-war [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1014.3199999999999s)]
*  Peacekeeping force in Ukraine but Germany Spain Italy [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1017.9599999999999s)]
*  Bought the idea Olaf Schultz was furious that it was brought up and discussed publicly in the days before his election [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1021.04s)]
*  He said he was quote a little bit irritated by the talks for a lot of shops [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1026.44s)]
*  That's like lighting I know it's all the incomprehensible debate at the wrong time about the wrong topic [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1029.9199999999998s)]
*  but the reason this this [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1034.1599999999999s)]
*  it's not all clear that you could implement a peacekeeping force like this because what they're talking about is what's called a tripwire force where [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1036.8799999999999s)]
*  The Russians know if they invade Ukraine fully and there's this international force there [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1043.08s)]
*  Then that would immediately put them in direct conflict with the US major powers in Europe NATO, etc [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1047.36s)]
*  But for that tripwire force to be effective [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1053.12s)]
*  They need to be backed by the United States like all those countries need to know that if their forces are attacked [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1055.48s)]
*  The US will come and get their back and Putin needs to know that so it doesn't do it and also for that [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1060.28s)]
*  this peacekeeping force to be [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1064.9199999999998s)]
*  To keep itself safe to be logistically feasible [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1067.84s)]
*  They need US air defenses intelligence logistics, none of which you can count on from the United States right now, so [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1070.32s)]
*  Like this is Europe sort of has no recourse at the moment. Zelensky didn't know what to do [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1077.1599999999999s)]
*  He was supposed to fly to Saudi Arabia tomorrow Wednesday when this pod comes out [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1082.32s)]
*  he canceled that trip in protests, but [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1086.6399999999999s)]
*  No one cares. None of the people there care. Yeah, I mean, this is the challenge [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1089.2399999999998s)]
*  you know the US is cutting Europe and Ukraine out of these negotiations if [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1093.3999999999999s)]
*  Ukraine is not gonna get NATO membership the only thing that you know might might make it worth it for them to say [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1098.08s)]
*  Okay, we've sacrificed all these lives. We've you know been fighting off the Russians for three years [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1105.4399999999998s)]
*  we need a security guarantee for somewhere because what the Ukrainians are worried about is they give Russia all the land that Russia currently occupies and [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1111.6799999999998s)]
*  Russia does weights and you know cannibalizes a few more hundred miles of Ukrainian territory in [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1119.8799999999999s)]
*  Two years or three years and so the question is this is why NATO membership mattered if Ukraine's gonna lose 20% of its territory [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1127.32s)]
*  They need to know that they're viable and secure on the back end of that now [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1134.2s)]
*  The US is totally out of that NATO is totally out of that [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1138.08s)]
*  So then the question becomes can the Europeans provide troop presence in Ukraine that can make a security guarantee credible on paper [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1140.36s)]
*  It's like okay. Well if the Europeans are talking about putting troops in that that's a good thing [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1148.28s)]
*  Well, first of all, it's kind of weird that they're not even at the table [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1152.2s)]
*  If they're gonna be fundamental part of how an agreement can stick they're not there [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1155.1599999999999s)]
*  The other problem though is in a world in which the US was actually committed to NATO and committed to Europe [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1159.04s)]
*  Yeah, number one. You might be able to make a [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1164.8s)]
*  Force like that stick because the United States would be supplying it the United States be providing intelligence to it [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1167.76s)]
*  The United States, you know [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1172.8799999999999s)]
*  Europe command for NATO would have some role and drawing up plans [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1174.28s)]
*  If you remove the US from the equation and the Europeans are just doing the most significant military mission [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1178.6799999999998s)]
*  in [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1184.68s)]
*  decades by Europeans [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1185.44s)]
*  Without any US participation. They're flying a little blind there [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1187.88s)]
*  There's also the question of if it's French and Germans and then maybe they get some poles and some Baltic countries to put [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1191.2800000000002s)]
*  You can roll it out. Yeah [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1197.16s)]
*  Well, so you get whoever you can in a pickup team who's in charge of this force [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1198.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, if the Russians actually invade Ukraine who is the commander on the ground gonna call Bob Muller Emmanuel McCrown exactly [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1201.8600000000001s)]
*  Is they're gonna call is Emmanuel McCrone in charge of British troops we is Keir Starmer in charge of French troops [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1209.44s)]
*  Where is the political leadership that would make decisions about what this force does and when it responds on paper? [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1215.44s)]
*  Tripwire force sounds great, but in practice, there's like a billion questions, particularly the US isn't involved [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1221.4s)]
*  And so this thing is moving really fast the Ukrainians can say no, we're not gonna participate in negotiations [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1227.64s)]
*  But if the US withdraw support and Trump is hammering Wade Zelensky and Putin is grinding away at the front line [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1233.26s)]
*  Boy that that could be an even darker [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1239.62s)]
*  Outcome where the Ukrainians kind of start to collapse on that front line because they have they're not getting the support from the US [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1242.9s)]
*  The political support is evaporating [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1248.26s)]
*  Putin feels emboldened. I mean this could go wrong in a lot of ways [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1250.14s)]
*  Yeah, this is this could go long go bad in the long run in the short run. Yeah, then we're gonna take a quick break, but [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1253.18s)]
*  Weird presidents day, huh? It's tough time in for us [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1259.54s)]

*  Let's turn to the JD Vance's visit to Germany in the speech [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1510.6599999999999s)]
*  Here's an excerpt from what JD had to say the threat that I worry the most about [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1514.22s)]
*  Vis-a-vis Europe is not Russia. It's not China [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1518.98s)]
*  It's not any other external actor and what I worry about is the threat from within [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1522.1200000000001s)]
*  the retreat of [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1528.42s)]
*  Europe from some of its most fundamental values values shared with the United States of America [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1530.18s)]
*  I look to Brussels where EU Commission commissars warn citizens that they intend to shut down [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1535.98s)]
*  Social media during times of civil unrest the moment they spot what they've judged to be quote [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1542.6599999999999s)]
*  Hateful content if you're running in fear of your own voters. There is nothing America can do for you [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1549.4199999999998s)]
*  Nor for that matter is there anything that you can do for the American people who elected me and elected President Trump? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1556.54s)]
*  Commissars are you know Communist Party officials usually responsible for some sort of political education [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1564.82s)]
*  So it's very nice message from JD [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1569.78s)]
*  So then despite all that we just talked about about the war in Ukraine going south the death the destruction [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1571.26s)]
*  The hellscape for Ukrainian people over the last three years JD decided to lecture Europe about social media censorship [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1577.6399999999999s)]
*  I do not recall him or Trump ever raising concerns about censorship with Victor Orban during his many visits the United States [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1584.8999999999999s)]
*  For example, but consistency is not their thing [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1591.82s)]
*  And then on top of that JD Vance specifically criticized German political parties for refusing to work with the AFD [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1593.94s)]
*  Which is the far-right political party in Germany all of these German political parties refused to work with the AFD are going to coalition with [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1600.1000000000001s)]
*  The AFD because they are so extreme and seen by many Germans to be the heir to the Nazi Party [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1607.3400000000001s)]
*  And while in Germany JD Vance blew off Olaf Schultz the current chancellor from the Social Democratic Party [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1614.38s)]
*  And he met with Alex Vidal the head of the AFD and we've discussed on this show that Elon Musk has repeatedly boosted the AFD [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1620.06s)]
*  He he did Twitter spaces chat with vital the the AFD leader [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1627.74s)]
*  He spoke at an AFD rally and the reason this matters so much right now is because Germany has a federal election on February 23rd [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1632.7s)]
*  It seems quite obvious that Vance's comments were designed to help the AFD in that election or to pressure other political parties [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1640.42s)]
*  To work with the AFD down the road right now German political analysts think the most likely outcome of this election is [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1647.46s)]
*  The CDU getting the most votes CDU is Angela Merkel's party the traditional [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1654.46s)]
*  Conservative party in Germany and that they will go into coalition with the Social Democrats [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1659.38s)]
*  Who will likely get third place which would make the CDU's leader Friedrich Mertz the next Chancellor? [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1665.22s)]
*  But the AFD is polling at 20 22 percent something in there the firewall [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1670.6200000000001s)]
*  Against working with the AFD [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1677.34s)]
*  Amongst other parties has been weakened by some very stupid political maneuvering by Mertz that we can get into if you want [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1680.1799999999998s)]
*  but just know that that has happened and [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1687.06s)]
*  You know the AFD it draws votes from people that agree with their [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1689.74s)]
*  Political views and serve like hardline right-wing positions against immigrants and Islam etc [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1694.7s)]
*  But also just [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1700.6599999999999s)]
*  People who are really mad and see voting for the AFD as a protest vote to say fuck you to the government [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1702.18s)]
*  I was listening to a German pollster give a talk about [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1707.02s)]
*  How angry and frustrated Germans are and how the overwhelming majority of Germans do not think that the political system as currently constituted? [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1710.06s)]
*  Even has the capacity to fix Germany's problem, so it's a pretty dark election right now [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1718.6599999999999s)]
*  So then join the club. Yeah, no kidding. So you were just in Munich at the Munich Security Conference [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1723.98s)]
*  I think you're an official member of JD Vance's [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1729.02s)]
*  Along with a Jack Psobek how to go have JD's can't comments go over in the room. I've never experienced something like it [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1732.1s)]
*  I really haven't I there's no hyperbole this week [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1738.56s)]
*  because [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1743.1399999999999s)]
*  This is a conference [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1744.7s)]
*  It's all predicated on there being a transatlantic Alliance on there being differences between the US and Europe that you kind of come together [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1745.8999999999999s)]
*  in Munich and you talk about them because you kind of agree that you're trying to get to the same place and [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1751.3799999999999s)]
*  You know without getting into you know in individual conversations [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1756.7s)]
*  You know, I I actually arrived at the venue right as JD Vance's was leaving from the speech [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1760.46s)]
*  But I had been kind of following it. I didn't need to be there for that [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1766.3600000000001s)]
*  over the course of the next you know day or two I was in rooms with [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1769.8200000000002s)]
*  European Prime Minister's foreign ministers like, you know senior people they looked like they had seen a ghost [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1775.26s)]
*  I mean it was like nothing I'd ever experienced in that [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1780.8200000000002s)]
*  Not only [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1785.14s)]
*  Had the US done this rug pull on Russia and Ukraine which was [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1786.78s)]
*  Destabilizing enough because Europe is just trying to figure out. Wait a second [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1792.3s)]
*  How can we continue to support Ukraine which is our own security because they see Ukraine as an extension of European security [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1795.3s)]
*  It's this kind of bulwark buffer between them and Russia [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1801.14s)]
*  But then for JD Vance to come and let's be very clear the AFD are the legacies of like German neo-nazis [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1804.22s)]
*  This is the German far-right this isn't even like, you know the National Front in France or national rally in France [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1811.76s)]
*  Which we don't like either and is also Putin backed. These are German Nazis, you know, they don't play the Holocaust [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1817.56s)]
*  They like use Nazi slogans and claim they don't know what they're doing [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1824.04s)]
*  Parts of the AFD are under surveillance by German intelligence because they're so extreme been dubbed extremist groups by Germans themselves [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1828.16s)]
*  and for JD Vance to go there and take his [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1835.12s)]
*  Anti-woke ideologies and apply them to the entire continent of Europe to back the far-right to refuse to meet the [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1839.8s)]
*  Sitting chancellor of one of the most important countries in the world [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1846.76s)]
*  Is insane enough? [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1850.6000000000001s)]
*  I will tell you that I was sitting in a dinner with some of these people [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1852.32s)]
*  when the news broke that he'd actually met with the AFD leader and these people are like looking at their phones like and [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1856.1200000000001s)]
*  And it was literally like just not knowing what the world is anymore [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1861.48s)]
*  You know up is down down is up like this this suddenly the United States is aligned with [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1866.68s)]
*  Far-right movements in their countries against them at the same time that the United States is aligned with [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1872.64s)]
*  Vladimir Putin and his ambitions in Ukraine against them and the Ukrainians just think of the whiplash [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1878.24s)]
*  This is not to say Europe is perfect. It is to say that it's good [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1884.96s)]
*  If the far-right is not in charge in fucking Germany, okay [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1888.88s)]
*  It's good if Vladimir Putin can't run roughshod over Ukraine and they don't know what to do [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1892.12s)]
*  I mean they are clearly they need to band together clearly they need more of a pan-european policy [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1897.08s)]
*  That's hard when European has this kind of fractious politics to begin with [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1901.6799999999998s)]
*  So there's the immediate term question like you raised in German politics itself, you know [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1905.32s)]
*  Wirtz Friedrich Wirtz the CDU leader. Look at you with the German pronunciation. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah about that [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1910.4399999999998s)]
*  He well, I'm just back from someone just went abroad. He's he's poised to win. He's moving way, right? [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1916.08s)]
*  This is not a miracle right time. He's talking about ceiling borders [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1921.16s)]
*  He's you know, we should say like short version is he put forward a hardline anti-immigration [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1924.24s)]
*  vote in the bundesag knowing that it could only pass if the AFD voted for it, which is seen by almost everybody as [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1930.16s)]
*  If not like in practice in spirit a break of the breach of the firewall sort of agreement [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1937.76s)]
*  Yeah [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1942.9s)]
*  and what this could do is it could just break that consensus against AFD inside of Germany because [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1943.0400000000002s)]
*  You know if he moves so far right he can't form a coalition with the Social Democrats for instance [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1948.9599999999998s)]
*  well [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1953.6399999999999s)]
*  then all sudden you might be looking at the AFD being in the German government and [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1954.1599999999999s)]
*  Having this kind of right far-right government in Germany, right with a French election coming up [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1957.76s)]
*  you know in the next couple years that could bring the far right to power in France and [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1963.52s)]
*  And then what kind of world are we living in? [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1967.7199999999998s)]
*  You know, this is starting to feel like the 30s a little bit and and not in well [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1970.4399999999998s)]
*  It could be like the 30s so how did JD Vance he has this kind of smarmy note the guys 40 fucking years old, right? [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1974.8s)]
*  and he's sitting over he has no experience in foreign policy really and [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1982.1200000000001s)]
*  He's just gonna go [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1986.3600000000001s)]
*  Pull a pin out of a grenade and throw it in the middle of Europe. I mean 16 years calling Trump a Nazi [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1987.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, this is just I done I words fail, you know, no, I know it again [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1992.3600000000001s)]
*  It just I think it's it's worth repeating that Trump has more in common [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=1997.56s)]
*  Just really culturally in terms of values with the Russians and the Saudis than he does with any of those leaders in Europe and JD [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2001.36s)]
*  Vance is there. Yeah, that's sort of parrot them. He prefers that system the leadership style Trump prefers spending time with them [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2006.9199999999998s)]
*  the only good news I heard Ben is I was listening to a [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2013.3999999999999s)]
*  editor Derspegel talk about the election and some of Elon Musk's bullshit and [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2016.3999999999999s)]
*  She said that it could backfire. Yeah, so far it seems like it has in part because [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2021.24s)]
*  Moderates don't really like Elon Musk. They think he's a prick because they're smart [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2026.56s)]
*  They read the paper and AFD voters [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2030.04s)]
*  Some of them are anti-american or anti-capitalist and it backfired in that sense. So maybe JD Vance's nonsense will do the same [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2033.2s)]
*  I was texting with someone in the Social Democratic Party the other day who said that like Vance's [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2040.8000000000002s)]
*  It was such brazen election interference that it didn't go over well that said around the same time. There was another horrific [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2046.8400000000001s)]
*  Attack by an asylum seeker in Germany. This guy drove a car [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2054.64s)]
*  People in Munich killed a bunch of folks which you know [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2058.56s)]
*  I think immigration was already probably a top issue in terms of salience in this upcoming election [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2061.96s)]
*  But you know, it almost seems like you're seeing this happen again and again in Germany [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2067.6s)]
*  I think in Austria there was a knife attack where there's [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2072.12s)]
*  Asylum seekers Syrian or Afghans who are attacking and murdering people almost as if like their actions are designed in the lab to boost [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2074.56s)]
*  the far right. Yeah, I mean we [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2081.3999999999996s)]
*  Unfortunately, we're talking a lot about Nazis in this podcast [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2084.44s)]
*  But part of what's also dangerous is this historical revisionism, right? Yep. So first, you know [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2086.96s)]
*  You mentioned the Brussels bureaucrats or the commissars as if they're like Stalinist because they have regulation in Brussels [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2092.96s)]
*  But let's go back to the Elon Musk thing [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2099.56s)]
*  With it when he did the dialogue with the AFD leader and they basically called the Nazis socialist [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2102.6s)]
*  communist [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2109.16s)]
*  I'm shocked I have to do this [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2111.96s)]
*  But I've been doing some deep reading on the Nazis just to kind of get ready for what's coming [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2113.44s)]
*  Maybe here and and let's bear in mind that Adolf Hitler literally came to power by forming a right-wing alliance [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2117.04s)]
*  And the way he was able to pull the conservatives in to his you know [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2124.2s)]
*  Becoming chancellor was to kind of mobilize a right-wing front against the Social Democrats and the communists [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2128.12s)]
*  And then after the Reichstag fire [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2134.48s)]
*  What he did is he basically killed all the leadership of the communist in the Social Democrats the night of the long nigh [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2137.18s)]
*  Which you may have heard of was literally the roundup and killing and imprisonment and concentration camp sending of the Social Democrats [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2142.9s)]
*  Right. This is not the fucking left. Okay, this is the far right and I hope I hope this isn't working in Germany [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2150.54s)]
*  I hope that maybe there's some good nationalism in the sense of like hey stay out of our politics JD Vance and Elon Musk [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2157.46s)]
*  But what I worry about is this kind of erosion of just historical memory because the whole reason we have all these alliances and [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2163.1s)]
*  Organizations and conferences is to not do that again [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2170.1s)]
*  And JD Vance seems to be he's playing with the worst kind of fire in the worst kind of places [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2172.9s)]
*  Yeah, so they mean this elections on Sunday will obviously cover it next week [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2178.7799999999997s)]
*  I mean, you know, maybe this will be okay. It will be the grand coalition, which is the CDU and the SPD [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2182.74s)]
*  Maybe they don't the maybe combined though those two parties don't get to 50% and they can't form a coalition and they have to bring [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2188.22s)]
*  In another third party, maybe it's the Green Party, which you know kind of sounds fine on paper [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2194.94s)]
*  But in practice, they just can't agree on anything [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2199.18s)]
*  So you have an unworkable government and I think the government kind of failing like that or or dissolving again [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2201.58s)]
*  Will often boost the far right? So this is a very important election [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2208.22s)]
*  One to watch and it really sucks that our own vice president is making it worse for all of Europe [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2212.02s)]
*  Quick update Ben just from neighboring Austria [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2218.24s)]
*  Because we're talking about neo-nazi so much today back in September [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2220.9599999999996s)]
*  We talked about Austria's elections where the far-right freedom party or FPO won a majority with about 29% of the vote ahead of [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2223.56s)]
*  The conservative People's Party by about three points [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2230.4399999999996s)]
*  So the despite the fact that the far-right party won the more slightly more moderate conservative party [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2233.4799999999996s)]
*  It was given the mandate to form a government first, but they failed [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2240.4799999999996s)]
*  There were a bunch of political maneuverings that then happened and then the far-right party the FBO and its leader [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2243.64s)]
*  Herbert Keekle were given the chance to try to form a government. He tried and tried and tried [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2249.92s)]
*  They couldn't come to an agreement and those talks fell apart and he was forced to sort of like give up the mandate [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2254.2s)]
*  That's given to you by the president to form a government last week and the sticking points were [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2260.12s)]
*  security immigration and the far-right parties pro-russia stance and what's interesting about this is a lot of [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2264.64s)]
*  Political analysts think that Keekle [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2271.48s)]
*  wanted these talks to blow up because one one thing that might come from this is [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2273.68s)]
*  Austria being forced to hold another set of elections and his party has been doing even better in polls [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2277.56s)]
*  Since the last round so the far-right is just gaining and gaining and gaining [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2283.48s)]
*  So long story short like we don't know who will be the next leader in Austria [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2287.52s)]
*  But this is just another example of this trend of the growing strength of these far-right parties across Europe [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2292.28s)]
*  Including the most extreme versions of them in Germany and in Austria [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2299.64s)]
*  Yeah, and I mean the only thing I'd add is if Russia's at the casino and they're pulling the slots [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2304.7599999999998s)]
*  Like they're just coming up triples every time right? [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2310.0s)]
*  I mean this could not be better for them and I'm not trying to see everything through that prism because it's bigger than that [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2312.4s)]
*  It's for the health of European democracies, too. It's you're right. They're pro-russia party [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2317.32s)]
*  Yeah, they are they're straight-up pro-russia parties [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2320.72s)]
*  And so this is just gonna completely scramble the geopolitical deck and in the end what it's gonna do is make Europe much much weaker [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2322.86s)]
*  because if Europe is divided between [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2329.6400000000003s)]
*  center-left and far-right and [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2332.5600000000004s)]
*  different flavors in between and and pro-russian and [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2335.1200000000003s)]
*  There's no where where if you're not pro-russian if you're what used to be pro-american and there's no America to be [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2339.8s)]
*  What are you like? What's what is the manual McCrone or cure starmer? [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2346.6800000000003s)]
*  Like there's not they have to have their own European identity now. So this is just gonna be an incredibly [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2350.48s)]
*  Bumpy ride is an understatement in European politics. Yeah big time. All right, let's switch hemispheres [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2356.3199999999997s)]
*  Because Argentina's president have your melee could be in some deep shit [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2361.92s)]
*  Thanks to his promotion of a meme coin crypto scam token called Libra [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2365.96s)]
*  The Financial Times said this was quote the biggest crisis for his administration since he took office in December of 2023 [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2370.12s)]
*  So been some basics for our non crypto loving listeners here a mean coin [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2377.12s)]
*  It's basically a crypto token that is often sold as a joke or a reference to some sort of like online community [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2382.56s)]
*  The first meme coin was dogecoin, which unfortunately has been appropriated by Elon Musk and his doge bags [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2387.7599999999998s)]
*  But the dogecoin was kind of designed to mock the absurd speculation happening in the crypto space [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2394.7599999999998s)]
*  And then all of a sudden it got so popular that the market cap of dogecoin [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2401.08s)]
*  Which to be clear buying a meme coin gets you nothing nothing. Literally doesn't exist in the physical world guys [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2405.62s)]
*  I hate to break it to you, but the market cap at one point at its peak of dogecoin was 85 billion dollars billion dollars [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2410.68s)]
*  Worthless thing so play money. So yeah, so these things are a joke, but they can also be incredibly lucrative [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2418.24s)]
*  Yeah, of course brings in the scammers. So folks great if you're Marc Andreessen [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2423.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, or Donald Trump because you might remember Trump and Lonnie a Trump they released their own meme coins right before the inauguration [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2426.72s)]
*  So that brings us back to last week Friday night. Have your melee tweets about the Libra coin [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2432.96s)]
*  Just after it after its launch this has the effect of shooting it up [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2439.4s)]
*  The market cap hits a peak of four point five six billion dollars [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2443.4s)]
*  And then the value of the coin collapsed 94% in 11 hours [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2446.88s)]
*  And then the meme coin biz this is what looks like what is called a rug pull where you have some [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2452.36s)]
*  Insiders who want a bunch of these coins they own them early at the cheapest price possible [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2457.88s)]
*  They pump the thing on social media a bunch of people come in and buy them and then they dump all their coins [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2462.84s)]
*  Pocket the money and everyone who bought in late is holding the bag [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2468.0800000000004s)]
*  You're stuck with this literally worthless thing and you lost all your money this rug pull happens [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2471.5600000000004s)]
*  Melee sees it. He tweets a statement saying he didn't know the details of the project. He wasn't connected to it [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2477.0400000000004s)]
*  I think he then deleted his initial tweet [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2482.48s)]
*  He tried to like scramble away from the thing [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2484.32s)]
*  But that didn't go over well the people lost money and also he's clearly lying [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2486.0400000000004s)]
*  Because melee personally met with one of the partners behind the project a guy who also worked on Melania's [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2490.1200000000003s)]
*  Mean coin so this is a mess some parts of the opposition are floating impeachment charges though that probably won't happen [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2497.3799999999997s)]
*  But then I mean it does seem like melee did a pretty good job of stating why showing why his worldview of [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2504.7799999999997s)]
*  Anarcho-capitalism is not really gonna work out at the long run for the little guy like if there's no rules no regulations. Yeah. Well [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2511.7s)]
*  You can kind of play with fake money [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2519.46s)]
*  More easily if you're like Donald Trump and you have the whole US government and Elon Musk behind you [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2522.08s)]
*  I think we should just note watch this crypto space again and again [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2527.7999999999997s)]
*  It's the quickest way to make the grift pay off quick, you know quickly if you're have all this inside information [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2533.24s)]
*  You're making money off fees like the Trump people do you're you know tipped off on the rug pull like others maybe in different? [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2540.56s)]
*  Transactions like this and I think what people need to wake up to around the world in this country in Argentina everywhere else [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2547.92s)]
*  Is like there's this kind of weird these guys are disruptors, and they're shaking things up, and they're breaking the establishment [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2552.6400000000003s)]
*  They don't give a shit about you know. They're just trying to get rich. I mean they're like [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2558.38s)]
*  The the worst-case scenarios. There's some like Russian hand-mined everything it could be quite simpler [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2564.36s)]
*  Which is it like these are just a bunch of corrupt? [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2569.84s)]
*  Plutocrats enriching themselves at everybody else's expense and laughing at us [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2572.64s)]
*  Just like laugh and laughing mainly at their own followers right like the people they had the least respect for because I'm not buying the fucking [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2577.6s)]
*  meme coin [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2584.52s)]
*  Libra Melania its fans of fans fans of Trump and they're just screwing their own people over and over and over again [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2585.64s)]
*  With these griffs and getting really really rich and and you know me lay [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2593.36s)]
*  Has been down at Mar-a-Lago [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2598.44s)]
*  I mean it just shows you that they're just circulating these ideas and they're repeating these ideas and and it's just it's one of the most [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2599.96s)]
*  Rampant forms of like looting and corruption that that we've seen that these leaders are getting elected on kind of this weird [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2607.76s)]
*  Masculine libertarian populism and then just relentlessly screwing the people that voted fucking the people over yeah eight eight wallets [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2616.5600000000004s)]
*  Linked to the Libra team cashed out over a hundred and seven million dollars [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2624.68s)]
*  They started the rug pull process only three hours after the debut and there's something called [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2628.64s)]
*  tokenomics with all of these coins and like good tokenomics have an [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2632.8s)]
*  Overwhelming amount of the supply like 80 90 percent locked up over the course of several years [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2637.7200000000003s)]
*  So you can't rug pull but in this case 82 percent of the supply was unlocked and sellable from the very start [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2641.92s)]
*  So this thing was designed for this exact scenario to happen and me like clearly just didn't care [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2647.36s)]
*  He's an economist, but he didn't look into this [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2652.32s)]
*  But let me read you this response from me like to his critics been quote to the filthy rats of the political cast who? [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2654.0400000000004s)]
*  Want to take advantage of this situation and do harm I want to say that every day [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2659.92s)]
*  They confirm how vile politicians are and they increase our conviction to kick them in the ass [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2663.48s)]
*  On the record it's like I've heard this kind of garbage from him for a while. When are people gonna stop falling for this? [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2668.76s)]
*  I know you know now you're in charge buddy every day. You've been running this country for a while now like [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2675.0s)]
*  These people are in charge of everything everything I mean this is a common theme on this podcast since Trump got elected [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2681.1600000000003s)]
*  You're in charge of everything and you're grifting your way left right and center [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2686.76s)]
*  And then whenever you get caught with the grift you attack politicians who have no power [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2690.8s)]
*  You know like you're fucking president. You know stop talking to me about politicians. You are the politician [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2695.92s)]
*  I know you are the president of this country [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2701.12s)]
*  And you see all these right-wingers celebrating me lay on the internet and being like wow he got rid of their deficit [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2703.2400000000002s)]
*  But they don't also talk about the fact that poverty increased to like [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2708.52s)]
*  53% in the first half of last year because he dozed the country like he got rid of all social services and so great [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2712.72s)]
*  There's no deficit, but there's no food on the table. Yeah [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2719.08s)]
*  All right, then let's let's turn to Mexico because we're recording this currently in Hollywood where we love a good reboot [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2722.24s)]
*  And so I thought you would be excited to learn that the CIA is [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2728.4s)]
*  Rebooting the war on drugs to make it more like the war on terror that worked so well [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2731.68s)]
*  Yeah, both of those work so well we're gonna work a GWAT this merge them. Yeah, John Ratcliffe the new CIA director [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2736.12s)]
*  He says he's gonna shift CIA resources to a [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2742.7599999999998s)]
*  Counter-narcotics mission and apply insights from the agency's two decades of combating terrorist networks to fighting drug cartels in Mexico [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2746.0s)]
*  This is a quote from the Washington Post someone talked to them on background about the plan quote [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2752.22s)]
*  Lessons learned in the counterterrorism realm are applicable to the counter [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2756.88s)]
*  Narcotics missions and the counter cartel mission the full weight of those has not been brought to bear on this problem [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2760.16s)]
*  The New York Times reported that the CIA began operating secret drone flights over Mexico during the Biden administration [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2766.24s)]
*  These drones hunt for chemicals that get emitted by fentanyl production plants [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2773.4s)]
*  And then the CIA passes that information along to the Mexican government to you know raid them or whatever [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2777.44s)]
*  The Times said that the CIA's work with the Mexican military has been more durable and has continued even during periods of big tension [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2782.3199999999997s)]
*  specifically when the US arrested the former Mexican [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2791.2799999999997s)]
*  Defense minister on drug charges back in 2020 remember that yeah [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2795.3799999999997s)]
*  They cut off work with the DEA at that time, but the CIA work was secret so it probably continued [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2799.2999999999997s)]
*  so then I assume the reason that the CIA is flying these drone missions is because [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2804.7s)]
*  It creates deniability for the Mexican government you can get like a presidential finding maybe and just make it a covert operation [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2810.2599999999998s)]
*  but it's what is not clear is whether the CIA is just going to [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2815.8999999999996s)]
*  Collect intelligence or whether they're gonna play the same paramilitary function that they played in the global war on terror like [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2821.3999999999996s)]
*  What do you think like what do you think the endgame is here? [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2829.08s)]
*  Do you think we're gonna hear someday about a hellfire missile strike on a fentanyl plant? [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2831.3599999999997s)]
*  You know I think so I mean the problem that we're facing is we also have this movement to designate as foreign terrorist [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2837.12s)]
*  Organizations all these cartels so you send a list over to Congress [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2844.24s)]
*  Yeah, and then by the way that list isn't just cartels [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2847.2s)]
*  It's also like Venezuelan gangs right yeah turn to your Agua on the list and and so [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2849.6s)]
*  You have the infrastructure like drones of the war on terror moving to this this hemisphere [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2854.92s)]
*  but you also the legal architecture right these terrorist designations and [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2862.2s)]
*  What I wonder about is how much is the Mexican government on board with this because this is a left-wing Mexican government so I [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2867.68s)]
*  Can't see like the Shane Baum administration having like that high comfort level no with a growing [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2875.88s)]
*  CIA footprint I mean these are literally Latin American leftists [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2883.7599999999998s)]
*  And so what happens when inevitably the US government? [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2886.56s)]
*  Captures more and more intelligence, and there's all this drone footage, and we're finding different places [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2890.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't think that the Mexican government is gonna sign off [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2895.7599999999998s)]
*  So what happens if the US starts taking drone shots and stuff? [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2899.16s)]
*  Over the objections of Mexico, I mean this is another thing that we have to entertain as a possibility [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2904.12s)]
*  I go like what's the saying like when your hammer every problem looks like a nail yeah, right? [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2909.72s)]
*  You could imagine a scenario where we're collecting all this Intel on [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2914.54s)]
*  Fentanyl plants in Mexico the Trump's getting updates on you know the amount of fentanyl coming across the border [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2918.12s)]
*  It's not decreasing because the reality is mostly getting traffic by American citizens [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2923.8s)]
*  Stashed in their car because it's easy to do and they're like well [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2928.9199999999996s)]
*  What if we use this capability and we strap a fucking hellfire on this predator drone and see what see what that does [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2932.3199999999997s)]
*  And and look for people who might say well at least then maybe he'll get at the fentanyl problem [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2939.16s)]
*  Just look at the record of the war on terror over sorry the war drugs [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2943.68s)]
*  Both both the number of jihadists went up exponentially under the war on terror and then amount of drug trafficking has gone up [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2948.12s)]
*  Exponentially in the time war on drugs whatever short-term benefit you might get by picking off a cartel leader or a fentanyl lab [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2955.04s)]
*  Is not if people in this country want to buy fentanyl. They'll find a way to buy it, you know and [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2961.96s)]
*  That doesn't mean you shouldn't try to disrupt it and stop it [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2968.04s)]
*  But the idea that there's some discrete strikes and operations that can solve this problem in Mexico [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2970.96s)]
*  There's like a 50 year history of drug policy that suggests that that's not the case [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2978.28s)]
*  No, and you'll probably cut off cooperation between the DEA and other parts of the Mexican government or any cooperation between the US and Mexican [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2982.9s)]
*  government and also it's a [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2990.7000000000003s)]
*  Supply and a demand issue. Well, exactly which we never talk about, you know [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2992.9s)]
*  Yeah [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2996.94s)]
*  All right [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2997.7400000000002s)]
*  well [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2998.34s)]
*  we also want to keep highlighting the fallout from this USA ID freeze because you know these cuts are [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=2998.62s)]
*  we were learning about the cuts in Washington and [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3004.86s)]
*  The impact is starting to ripple out all around the world and we're hearing real stories about the people being harmed [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3007.9399999999996s)]
*  So we wanted to highlight that so a couple stories Ben [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3013.3399999999997s)]
*  So the New York Times reported on aid programs to help victims of Agent Orange in Vietnam [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3015.8399999999997s)]
*  Which affected up to three million people there after the war? [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3021.22s)]
*  There's including 150,000 children who were born with developmental disabilities [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3024.8999999999996s)]
*  So in addition to the mine clearing programs we talked about that were being stopped because of the aid freeze [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3029.02s)]
*  There was a contamination removal effort from a former US Air Base that is now done away with and they're also [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3035.54s)]
*  The US is now ripping away support from people who are disabled because the US dumped chemicals on them or their families [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3043.1800000000003s)]
*  Back in the 70s. So that's really great [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3050.82s)]
*  CNN's Ivan Watson had a report from a refugee camp in Thailand that holds 30,000 people who fled the Civil War in Myanmar [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3054.1s)]
*  There used to be a hospital at this camp [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3060.1s)]
*  Thanks to USAID cuts there now isn't a single doctor left and the camp has been abandoned the nearest Thai Hospital is a [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3062.02s)]

*  They will die [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3159.8999999999996s)]
*  There's no other way around it full stop. They will die. I spoke to over this weekend spoke to the head of [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3161.2599999999998s)]
*  head of a program that's [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3167.18s)]

*  people every year that with tb this program has completely stopped it's [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3177.82s)]
*  It's not happening at all [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3183.6600000000003s)]
*  And the consequences, I mean, they're already seeing that the the head of this program [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3186.06s)]
*  Said, you know over these last three weeks [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3191.26s)]
*  They've they've had 330 over 330 people die as a result of this stop work order so far [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3193.42s)]

*  It's just like so cruel and immoral like these are people who are severely disabled because of something the u.s [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3204.7000000000003s)]

*  And just on a moral level it's wrong and like if you just want to be like a [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3222.46s)]
*  Marco rubio pretend real politic like can you think of a better way to push vietnam into the arms of china? [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3227.5800000000004s)]

*  first of all [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3236.38s)]
*  For all the efforts that are going to happen and continue to happen from the elon musk's and doge bros [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3238.78s)]
*  Doge bags, whatever you call them [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3243.9s)]
*  To highlight, you know one opera in ireland and make all of usaid that this is the vast majority of what usaid does [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3246.38s)]
*  And people are dying because of elon musk and doge and donald trump and their fucking supporters who think that this is like a big [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3252.78s)]
*  Joke and the cool thing that elon's doing and so just on a human level [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3258.94s)]
*  Like many many people will die and I think what people have to understand you're hearing that in the clips [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3263.1s)]
*  Usaid fills spaces where there's nobody else to backfill them like that's why they're there [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3267.56s)]
*  They're not in places where there's like a redundancy of hospitals [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3272.1400000000003s)]
*  They're in a place like the thai mianmar border or some part of africa where there's not health infrastructure [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3275.02s)]
*  And so if you remove it, there's literally nothing else that can take its place [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3280.3s)]
*  And that should concern you on a human level if you are not a human being that has feelings for other human beings [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3284.3s)]
*  If you're essentially a sociopath like elon musk [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3289.7400000000002s)]

*  They said of course we should continue doing that. Yeah, but we're just we're killing off these incredible life-saving programs [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3345.82s)]
*  Some of the most successful things we've done as a country. Yeah [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3350.78s)]

*  Fortunately the deal held the hostage releases continued on saturday with three israelis coming home [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3377.9s)]
*  And a bunch of palestinian prisoners being released this week hamas agreed to release six living hostages [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3384.2200000000003s)]
*  Which is actually double the original planned number. They will be released this coming saturday [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3389.98s)]
*  This is an exchange for the israelis allowing mobile homes at the gaza [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3394.46s)]
*  And also allowing in heavy machinery that can comb through the rubble for bodies [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3398.5400000000004s)]
*  Also this week hamas is set to release the bodies of four hostages dead hostages [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3402.7799999999997s)]
*  Including members of the b boss family who are still being held [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3408.38s)]
*  Sheree b boss her four-year-old son ariel in kafir their nine-month-old baby were all taken on october 7th [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3412.86s)]
*  They all died during captivity [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3419.9s)]
*  Hamas says they were killed by an israeli airstrike that has not been confirmed [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3421.9s)]
*  Uh, but I think the fact that hamas would kidnap two babies has become kind of like the defining example of their fucking evil and cruelty [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3426.86s)]
*  Yarden b boss their father was released from captivity earlier this month [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3434.3s)]
*  He was one of the men who looked like a holocaust survivor [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3438.78s)]
*  He gets to go home to a house with no one. So, um, this war is just hell on earth [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3442.38s)]
*  um the [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3447.1800000000003s)]
*  The in response to these hostage releases by hamas israel said they're going to free [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3448.54s)]
*  All women prisoners and prisoners under the age of 18 who are arrested since the october 7th attacks [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3453.74s)]
*  that has I think created a [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3460.14s)]
*  Pretty unreasonable debate ben about whether you're a prisoner or a hostage if you were just kind of picked up for not doing anything [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3461.98s)]
*  Yeah after october 7th at gaza, but conversation for another day. Um, but [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3467.98s)]
*  Bigger picture the first phase of the ceasefire ends on march 2nd [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3472.7799999999997s)]
*  I mean they're about they've sort of sped up the release of the hostages [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3476.3799999999997s)]
*  So the first phase will be complete pretty soon the talks for the second phase have not officially begun [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3479.66s)]
*  Reuter says reuters reported that indirect negotiations for phase two are going to begin this week steve witkoff [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3485.02s)]
*  Trump's middle east envoy seemed confident. He says he told fox news that phase two is absolutely going to begin. That's a quote [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3491.3399999999997s)]
*  I saw earlier today. There's reports that the israelis and hamas are both going to send teams to qatar to negotiate [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3497.8199999999997s)]
*  So those are all good signs of progress [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3504.3799999999997s)]
*  And I hope you know steve witkoff is right and he's not too focused on whatever he's doing in saudi with the russians right now [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3507.1800000000003s)]
*  But ben, I mean the thing I keep thinking about is like whatever political incentive hamas had [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3512.94s)]
*  To actually get to phase three of this deal the reconstruction phase kind of went out the window when trump decided that we're gonna [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3517.58s)]
*  Ethnically cleanse and occupy the thing. I mean like trying to understand how this this works now [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3524.06s)]
*  Yeah, it's good that this didn't get derailed. It's good that phase one is still moving forward [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3528.2200000000003s)]
*  I just think you know, this gets exponentially harder at each juncture [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3532.62s)]
*  And so long as the operating plan is [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3536.22s)]
*  the riviera, uh, [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3539.42s)]
*  You know in gaza, um, we're not going to get there. So so, uh [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3541.66s)]
*  The thing to watch is is how the phase two negotiations go forward how people start talking about actual reconstruction [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3546.8599999999997s)]
*  Who's responsible for administering security in gaza? [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3553.5s)]
*  You know whether there's still an ethnic cleansing plan on the table or not. Um, so but this does show there seems to be a real [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3556.94s)]
*  Mutual interest between you know, believe it or not [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3564.46s)]
*  You know the israeli government in hamas to to not see the phase one go away and that's good [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3567.26s)]
*  And hopefully that can be a basis for for getting to those [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3571.66s)]
*  more difficult issues and hopefully they can kind of [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3575.42s)]
*  I don't know. I just don't think the u.s. I mean witkopf seems to have played like a constructive role here [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3578.7s)]
*  you kind of want trump to to not be that focused on it because [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3583.34s)]
*  um, you know the the the riviera plan is not going to be [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3587.58s)]
*  Uh one that sells no you want trump to shut up. I'd also love to see um, [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3591.58s)]
*  Certain former biden officials shut up and stop, uh writing op-eds [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3596.46s)]
*  Yeah, brett mcgurk [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3600.86s)]
*  We should just name this brett mcgurk op-ed in the washington post is totally bonkers alternative reality stuff [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3601.98s)]
*  Like, you know, israel did nothing wrong. I mean it was just only hamas was to blame [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3606.38s)]
*  This is just not what anybody were not ending at the time and notably nobody else from the biden administration is even making that [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3609.6600000000003s)]
*  Exact case so not helpful but really gross and awful [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3616.78s)]
*  You know the other thing I saw a lot been online was um, there was a report in the ap on february 6 [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3620.46s)]
*  That that said at one point the biden administration had talked to the egyptians about maybe moving gauzans out of gaza for the war [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3626.06s)]
*  Temporarily and then moving them back in long term [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3633.8s)]
*  um [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3637.02s)]
*  This was sort of this was picked up by critics of the biden administration of which we we are very much in that camp [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3637.9s)]
*  But who are trying to say actually [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3645.5s)]
*  trump's ethnic cleansing plan [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3648.62s)]
*  Is the same as biden's policy because biden according to this report had an ethnic cleansing plan. I reached out to a bunch of [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3650.86s)]
*  Former biden officials to try to just like understand what this ap report was about and what they said it happened was [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3657.42s)]
*  Right after october 7th tony blinken flew to israel netanyahu pitched them on the idea [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3663.26s)]
*  Of moving civilians out of gaza for the war in any other part of the world like that's not a crazy idea [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3669.98s)]
*  But obviously given the history there and the nakba and everything else that happened like that [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3676.54s)]
*  That's a non-starter for the palestinians for the palestinian leadership tony knew that [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3680.06s)]
*  But tony was probably thinking I don't want to tell I don't have to deliver this [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3684.78s)]
*  No to bb i'll take the idea to arab capitals including to egypt and run it by them and get the hard no from these guys [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3688.46s)]
*  Lcc and then bring that message back to israel and relay it to bb. I think that [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3695.34s)]
*  Diplomatic process got relayed as the u.s pushing for the ethnic cleansing of gaza [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3700.76s)]
*  But like that's just not at all what happened. No and and look people [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3706.54s)]
*  People should be able to think enough and like we've been plenty critical of the biden gaza policy [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3712.14s)]
*  But there's a difference between floating different ideas and private diplomatic channels and giving a press conference standing next to the prime minister of israel [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3716.78s)]
*  And calling for ethnic cleansing and the construction of real estate, you know hotels in gaza [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3724.54s)]
*  Like it's just not the same thing. Yeah, and like i've just i've seen people that I think they're smart and respect [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3729.74s)]
*  Equating those two and it's like guys. We don't need to do that [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3736.2s)]
*  We can be critical of the biden policy without yeah turning into a trump cartoon. Yeah, uh final thing [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3739.02s)]
*  Uh, then I just want to highlight some reporting in the last couple weeks on iran's nuclear program [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3745.18s)]
*  So the wall street journal had the headline [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3750.8599999999997s)]
*  Israel sees opening for strikes on iranian nuclear site u.s [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3753.34s)]
*  Intelligence finds the post seemed to have gotten the same document [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3756.46s)]
*  It said israel likely to strike iran in upcoming months warns u.s intelligence [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3759.42s)]
*  This intelligence said israel is likely to attempt a strike on iran's nuclear facilities in the first six months of 2025 [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3763.26s)]
*  Trump had recently kind of I think truth or tweeted [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3771.34s)]
*  Uh quote reports that the united states working in conjunction with israel is going to blow iran its smithereens are greatly exaggerated [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3774.7000000000003s)]
*  um, so [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3782.0s)]
*  That suggests he's leaning towards a more diplomatic solution [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3783.52s)]
*  but reading these reports ben it reminded me the first couple months of the obama administration when [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3786.96s)]
*  Jeff goldberg our buddy from the atlantic clearly like did a reporting trip to israel got fed by [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3792.2400000000002s)]
*  50,000 israeli cabinet officials that they were going to bomb iran in six months brought that story back to us [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3799.1s)]
*  We had to kind of deal with the fallout [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3804.96s)]
*  This is a little different because [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3807.92s)]
*  You know this reporting in the journal in the post is coming from some sort of leaked u.s [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3809.92s)]
*  Intelligence product but the net effect is the same thing which is a pressure campaign on the united states to do something [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3813.04s)]
*  With respect to iran's nuclear program soon or else iran's going to take action now [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3820.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm, not sure how that pressure campaign works with trump [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3825.2s)]
*  Because like I don't know. I just don't know what he thinks about this [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3828.0s)]
*  But it was it was weird to see these reports and I wonder what you made of these leaks. I mean it could be [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3830.4s)]
*  One of two things [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3835.3599999999997s)]
*  either [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3836.7999999999997s)]
*  It's people that are you know in the u.s [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3838.0s)]
*  Intelligence community who are worried about israel doing this and are just trying to kind of get this out there to spark some debate [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3840.56s)]
*  about it [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3845.7599999999998s)]
*  um, or yeah, or it could be people that [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3846.7999999999997s)]
*  Want trump to kind of prioritize this issue and do something or else, you know [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3849.7599999999998s)]
*  Which is what it always was with us. I will say like trump himself does not seem to be [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3853.9199999999996s)]
*  that [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3859.12s)]
*  Inclined for the iran war. I mean, you know, it seems lower probability than greenland, you know at this point [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3860.0s)]
*  um, which doesn't mean it couldn't ever happen, but [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3866.0s)]
*  He seems to always have been a little careful about you know, getting into another middle eastern war [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3869.52s)]
*  um, so [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3874.2400000000002s)]
*  The question to me becomes would israel actually? [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3876.08s)]
*  bomb iran's nuclear facilities kind of over trump's objections and [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3879.44s)]
*  Stranger things have happened [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3884.64s)]
*  But I don't know this feels like posturing everybody knows [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3886.56s)]
*  Trump is going to possibly explore diplomacy or he might not [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3890.48s)]
*  and go the pressure route and and I think this leaking is part of kind of the alignment of pieces to [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3894.96s)]
*  To kind of just try to accelerate the timeline in which something is done here [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3901.52s)]
*  But given the nature of the global environment what i've always been worried about trump is that there's so much chaos that [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3905.7599999999998s)]
*  it's just like well, let's go now because people's attentions are in nine different places and [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3911.04s)]
*  And uh, but the problem is if they do that then the iranians could hit, you know the golf and all bets are off [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3915.52s)]
*  Yeah, I think like at the end of the day netanyahu's preferred [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3921.84s)]
*  Outcome would be drawing the u.s into this to head to do it do his dirty work for him [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=3926.24s)]

*  Uh the recent developments between russia and the united states. I was in munich and got an earful about that [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4178.24s)]
*  um [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4184.799999999999s)]

*  Understand how the russians might be looking at this. Um [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4189.44s)]
*  Just from your reporting and your analysis over the years [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4193.679999999999s)]
*  how do you think that [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4197.599999999999s)]
*  putin and the russian government are [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4199.679999999999s)]
*  Digesting this, you know call from trump this upcoming meeting in riad [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4203.74s)]
*  this blowback from uh, the europeans and ukrainians to trump's policies just generally speaking, uh, how would you characterize [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4209.759999999999s)]
*  Your understanding of the russian reaction to these events [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4218.240000000001s)]
*  Well, the russians have tried to play this down and express, you know, cautious optimism [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4221.68s)]
*  But I think looking at what trump's team have said in trump himself [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4227.360000000001s)]
*  This has really gone about as well for them as it possibly could have and the russians [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4231.280000000001s)]
*  Didn't really have to do anything to make it happen [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4236.320000000001s)]
*  They haven't budged an inch on any of putin's pretty maximalist demands that are more or less unchanged at the start of the war [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4239.92s)]
*  And the united states has just in a matter of a week completely followed into their lap [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4246.879999999999s)]
*  It's made some major concessions already on on on us policy and it appears to be ready to accept a [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4251.04s)]
*  Large swathe at the very least of russian demand. So I think if you're russia you really have got to be pretty thrilled [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4259.759999999999s)]
*  About the way this is going [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4266.5599999999995s)]
*  It's like where we were a month ago and and compare it even two weeks ago and compare it to now [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4268.08s)]
*  It's like two different worlds the the idea that you could have at the you know [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4273.5199999999995s)]
*  The palace where this is taking place in riad today [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4277.839999999999s)]
*  You had the us and russian flags side by side that was completely inconceivable and now it's just the reality we live in [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4280.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean i'm curious. I mean you mentioned the changes. I mean hegseth basically concedes [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4287.5199999999995s)]
*  That you know ukraine is not going to be a nato [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4293.04s)]
*  That ukraine's gonna have to give up territory, you know kind of de facto acknowledging [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4295.759999999999s)]
*  Um russia's annexation of large swathes of ukrainian territory [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4301.200000000001s)]
*  Um, you have you know instead of the biden approach of nothing about ukraine without ukraine [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4306.72s)]
*  This is literally the opposite. It's everything about ukraine without ukraine. Um [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4313.52s)]
*  You look at the russian press [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4319.52s)]
*  Uh the russian media, which is a pretty good window into kind of what the kremlin wants out there [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4321.92s)]
*  um, what what has been the the nature of the [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4326.8s)]
*  reaction to this, uh [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4330.8s)]
*  Like as you just kind of look at russian media and what might that say about how the kremlin's looking at things? [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4332.64s)]
*  I think it's very much a message that russia's way of the world is winning out and that the u.s [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4337.92s)]
*  seems to share it which basically means that ukraine is going to have the [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4344.56s)]
*  Worst possible option for ukraine voice it on demand the europeans are also going to have [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4351.120000000001s)]
*  To to deal with it what this is really about if you're if you're russia and putin has been pretty clear on this is that [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4356.0s)]
*  It's uh, you know for all his obsessions with ukraine ukraine has been in his mind the pretext to this to this war [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4362.240000000001s)]
*  Which in mind is really about broader geopolitical [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4368.4800000000005s)]
*  confrontation with the west you know chiefly the united states and what he's wanted is some sort of new yalta conference [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4371.42s)]
*  if if you will where the great powers can can sit down like uh, roosevelt and church of little stallion at the [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4378.64s)]
*  end of um [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4385.76s)]
*  Except there wasn't roosevelt was truman because roosevelt was dead [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4387.04s)]
*  a new yalta conference like uh truman and uh churchill, uh [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4390.8s)]
*  sat down at the end of the second world war with with stalin and they carved up europe into spheres of [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4395.04s)]
*  influence and that's very much what he has been pushing for and it looks like with this very [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4400.9400000000005s)]
*  Transactional view of the world that trump has that he's been able to to push [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4407.02s)]
*  Uh the buttons of the u.s. Really? [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4412.320000000001s)]
*  Spectacularly, I was just just watching again just now this this clip from the [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4416.780000000001s)]

*  But we'll be able to to partner with with russia on on a whole range of issues and and and really this has been [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4432.64s)]
*  Putin's dream is this is the message that the russia has been putting out on on tv and uh through [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4440.5599999999995s)]

*  discuss and [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4456.5599999999995s)]
*  That is an enormous triumph for russia just the fact that this meeting even happened is a [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4458.64s)]
*  Really gigantic step forward from them back in from the cold and with a seat at the table of great powers [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4465.360000000001s)]

*  Those are two pretty huge [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4511.76s)]
*  russian positions [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4514.24s)]
*  um [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4516.4s)]
*  But is that enough? I mean, you know because there's you could also look at it and say [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4517.36s)]
*  Well, prudently has the advantage on the battlefield now. Why not try to grind this out for another year? [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4521.44s)]
*  accumulate some more territory solidify control of the [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4527.66s)]
*  Parts of ukraine that russia has tried to you know claim as annexed [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4531.12s)]
*  Do you think that russia might drive a harder bargain or do you think that they could accept? [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4536.24s)]
*  essentially a frozen conflict, uh on their terms [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4541.12s)]
*  And that leads them in control and kind of [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4544.4800000000005s)]
*  you know diminishes the standing of the ukrainians and [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4547.92s)]
*  You know fractures the europeans is that enough or do you think food might want more? [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4551.92s)]
*  So two things firstly, I think it's important just to go back and say very simply what the russian goals are [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4555.84s)]
*  They are for ukraine to cease to assist as a viable state to be be so weak [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4562.32s)]
*  They can't effectively defend itself and not integrate enough into western security architecture nato or some nato substitute [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4568.48s)]
*  that uh [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4576.799999999999s)]
*  Would would protect us efficiently from from russia to ideally have a more pliant leadership [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4578.0s)]
*  Uh putin still seems to think that he could have some sort of [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4583.5199999999995s)]
*  Moscow-friendly politicians like the ones who ruled ukraine for the first 15 years or so of its independence [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4587.0199999999995s)]
*  And and again when victor yunikovych was president in the early 2010s [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4593.44s)]
*  And going beyond that to what we just talked about this this new european security architecture [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4597.78s)]
*  Which is really dividing up the the world [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4603.7s)]
*  into spheres spheres of influence and rolling back us influence in in europe and [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4606.42s)]
*  The the thing is that if you this brings me a second point [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4613.62s)]
*  You know these very maximalist demands and it is pretty clear [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4617.54s)]
*  From you know what what what I hear [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4621.9400000000005s)]
*  and from whatever intel appears to be out there that there's no no reason for Putin to stop unless he [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4625.14s)]
*  Gets what he wants because he is getting getting a lot of that anyway. He's [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4631.62s)]
*  Going he's basically already secured even before trump took power, you know, it wasn't realistic that uh, ukraine is going to get to nato [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4639.14s)]
*  It wasn't realistic that they were going to [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4646.1s)]
*  Get up their territories [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4649.7s)]
*  So it wasn't necessarily that hexeth was wrong to say it out because that assessment isn't that different different from what you would have gotten from [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4650.9s)]
*  the biden administration [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4658.66s)]
*  European ally but the the second point is is that these things are supposed to be [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4660.179999999999s)]
*  Leveraged because these are policy steps that the united states can can take right and what is just extraordinary to me [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4664.42s)]
*  Is the u.s. Is basically conceited all of that some of it before negotiations even begun and [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4672.42s)]
*  Again today there seems to have been a pretty big focus on the lifting of sanctions and on economic [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4678.5s)]
*  cooperation between russia and the u.s [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4685.76s)]
*  Uh this this idea that american and russian companies can can invest together [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4688.26s)]
*  Let me let me remind you [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4694.66s)]
*  Under us law right now most of this is illegal because of sanctions. So and you would think [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4697.14s)]
*  That what is the point of sanctions, you know [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4704.900000000001s)]
*  You could you know argue a lot and and people have looking at russia iran iraq over the years venezuela [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4706.9800000000005s)]
*  About whether sanctions are effective in achieving political goals [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4712.900000000001s)]
*  But the whole point of having sanctions and trump himself has has said this [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4715.54s)]
*  Is that these are supposed to be? [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4720.42s)]
*  the the carrot this is this is the leverage that united states has for for making [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4723.06s)]
*  Concessions and keith callag the special envoy for the the conflict who has [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4729.0599999999995s)]
*  Been been not only has he been sidelined from from talking to russia. He wasn't there today, but [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4734.5s)]
*  The white house also let the kremlin basically announce a personnel decision today [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4739.94s)]
*  Yuri shakhov putin's foreign policy advisor said that callag wasn't going to be talking to russia [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4746.18s)]
*  He was only going to talk to ukraine in europe and trump was going to appoint someone else who is going to be the [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4751.94s)]
*  The us russia person [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4757.3s)]
*  on ukraine [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4759.3s)]
*  He he knows as well and it was a big part of his plan [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4760.82s)]
*  He he made this very clear, but it seems that that has all [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4764.66s)]
*  gone out the window and [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4768.82s)]
*  That is just just what is I think the most remarkable thing about this is that evidently? [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4771.0599999999995s)]
*  trump wants to get a deal as quickly as he can and he isn't very interested [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4777.86s)]
*  In using any any of the leverage that the united states has and you know, if you're if you're russia [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4784.580000000001s)]
*  You can't be anything but thrilled about that. So there are two other ways in which russia could potentially [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4790.740000000001s)]
*  Flex its muscles or interfere in european security that I want to put to you [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4798.9800000000005s)]
*  And just get your assessment of what we should be [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4804.900000000001s)]
*  looking at worried about [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4807.860000000001s)]
*  One is politics and so [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4810.66s)]
*  If I look at the jd vance speech in munich about traditional western values and the need to kind of embrace [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4813.299999999999s)]
*  The afds of the world the far-right parties in europe [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4820.099999999999s)]
*  Sounded a lot like what pudin's been saying for years [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4824.259999999999s)]
*  You know [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4826.259999999999s)]
*  There are these traditional western values that are kind of separate from democracy and [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4826.82s)]
*  They're kind of nationalist in nature and their traditional christian [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4831.62s)]
*  cultural values [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4835.86s)]
*  Um, so the first question is [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4837.38s)]
*  You know how concerned sure would be or how much of an opening is there for pudin to kind of come in behind? [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4840.1s)]
*  You know, he's supported some of these far-right parties in the past [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4845.62s)]
*  Obviously has relationships with people like orban that are better than other europeans [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4848.58s)]
*  And then the other is just the near abroad of russia if there are spheres of influence [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4852.74s)]
*  If i'm in georgia right now if i'm in moldova right now [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4856.58s)]
*  perhaps even in the baltics right now [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4860.74s)]
*  I suddenly am kind of concerned that russia may feel like they have [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4863.38s)]
*  A carte blanche in the united states to have a sphere of influence. I mean, where do you look for? [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4867.38s)]
*  The potential for further russian [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4872.9800000000005s)]
*  interference aggression [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4875.68s)]
*  Fluxing in these kind of political spaces in this new reality [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4877.9400000000005s)]
*  So let's separate western and eastern europe for for a minute because I think there are some important distinctions that need to be made [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4882.58s)]
*  Uh, I am a [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4888.74s)]
*  Very ardent proponent of of the theory, you know [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4891.54s)]
*  This this was sometimes hard to get across during the first trump administration, but [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4895.299999999999s)]
*  Really? [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4900.099999999999s)]
*  This this was not something that that russia created these these were tendencies that were happening already in american european society [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4901.139999999999s)]
*  the the rise of uh populist parties and uh [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4908.74s)]
*  And right-wing parties backwashes against uh, globalization immigration. We we don't need to go into that and I think if you're [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4911.78s)]
*  If you're russia, you just look at european politics now [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4919.46s)]
*  You know as as well as trump coming back and uh, there's there's this um [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4923.3s)]
*  There's this book about the the kGB's plans influence the third world [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4927.86s)]
*  That's that's called the world was going our way [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4931.94s)]
*  And I think if you're russia absolutely you do think the world is is going your way in in france [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4933.94s)]
*  It's entirely possible that marine le pen might finally become the president in germany [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4939.14s)]
*  The afd is expected to do very well at the elections later this week in [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4944.66s)]
*  Austria you have this this party that is likely to to form the the government they are currently [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4951.54s)]
*  In coalition negotiations right now if i'm not wrong, uh, because I don't know very much about austria [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4958.58s)]
*  Uh, that is actually a partner of of united russia [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4964.259999999999s)]
*  Putin's party they they still have this partnership. So I I don't think they need to do very much [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4968.5s)]
*  I think there's enough that's that's going on in in in western society where [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4973.7s)]
*  west european society where [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4978.58s)]
*  If if you're russia, you you feel very much like the things that that vance talked about in munich [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4981.139999999999s)]
*  are [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4987.7s)]
*  Going your way if you think about [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4988.66s)]
*  the the former soviet and soviet occupied countries, I think [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4991.7s)]
*  there is a bit of a difference there because [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=4996.339999999999s)]
*  It it's it's more about how russia perceives threats [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5001.219999999999s)]
*  Georgia, they've basically sorted that out [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5004.82s)]
*  You you have this authoritarian [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5007.459999999999s)]
*  Moscow-friendly inasmuch as as any government in georgia can be [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5009.94s)]
*  Moscow-friendly they've done a effective job of uh, suppress of suppressing opposition to drifting into the [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5013.86s)]
*  Russian embrace there's there's no prospect of georgia joining nato [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5021.46s)]
*  Moldova [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5028.24s)]
*  Is is more problematic for them to to influence now, especially uh, that's one consequence of the war because transnistria the uh, the [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5030.74s)]
*  Enclave with a small russian troop deployment. There is a basically cut off now from russia being able to influence it seriously and [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5039.22s)]
*  the government just uh, just about squeaked through the the pro-eu referendum there, but [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5048.42s)]
*  the the real issue is is is the baltics and not just the baltics themselves what the baltics means about [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5055.38s)]
*  european security because this this is the [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5062.26s)]
*  Absolute nightmare scenario if if you are a nato advocate is that uh [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5065.139999999999s)]
*  Seeing how trump feels about european security, which is basically, you know, you do it, you know so much for the [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5071.7s)]
*  American security umbrella that nato is is built on [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5079.62s)]
*  Go go deal with it yourselves k thanks bye and by the way, here's the bill and does [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5085.62s)]
*  Uh, what what the the scenario has always been is that you you have these uh, [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5091.38s)]
*  You have these nato contingents in latvia lithuania, estonia [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5098.58s)]
*  You have some some cities that have quite quite large russian-speaking populations where there is still [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5102.66s)]
*  some of them do sympathize with with russia to some extent on the border like narvian estonia dog of pills in [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5109.06s)]
*  in latvia and [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5116.02s)]
*  You you try something there [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5118.34s)]
*  And some some sort of limited incursion doesn't have to be you know, some some big invasion [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5120.42s)]
*  I don't think putin is interested in in the baltics the way that he is in [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5125.78s)]
*  uh, you know certainly not ukraine or [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5130.1s)]
*  Even the coxis in central central asia. I remember a few months before the war [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5133.14s)]
*  He said that the soviet union broke up into 12 states [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5138.42s)]
*  Not 15 living out the three baltic states and an estonian expert. I I know texted me in that moment and said [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5142.18s)]
*  The whoo [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5148.74s)]
*  but uh what what they are important for is is uh using them to undermine nato because if uh, [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5150.9s)]
*  The the united states doesn't you know respond in in any kind of serious way [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5157.139999999999s)]
*  That essentially shows that article 5 the collective defense clause of uh nato, you know attack on one members and that kind of all [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5163.0599999999995s)]
*  That shows that it's essentially paper tiger it it amounts for nothing and uh, you know, putin could could feel that he's essentially [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5169.94s)]
*  Dealt with the nato problem once and for all and uh, you know that that is the the the scary problem [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5177.54s)]
*  I think you know not that he wants to um [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5184.5s)]
*  You you get these really extreme people in the russian system like ramzan kadir if the cheshev dictator or people like that [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5186.98s)]
*  Who say yeah, we want to drive to poland on on tanks. That is all for show that it it is [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5192.74s)]
*  I don't want to say that he's not interested in empire and not interested in you know gathering the russian lands [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5199.54s)]
*  Uh like like peter the great because he is but really more than anything else. This is about uh, [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5205.46s)]
*  The new world order for him and uh, I think that you know, anything he does with regards to europe will be out achieving that [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5211.3s)]
*  Yeah, no, that makes sense. So uh, definitely watch the baltics. Um, [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5218.9800000000005s)]
*  But but do so with the caveat that it's mainly about undermining, uh the west. Uh, well one last question. I want to ask you. Um, [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5223.46s)]
*  You know in russia itself we're not just three years into the full-scale war in ukraine [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5231.3s)]
*  It's been a year since alexei navalny died [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5236.66s)]
*  um, I saw julia navalny across the room in berlin there was a [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5239.94s)]
*  Uh a ceremony or event marking navalny's death in berlin. Um, [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5245.78s)]
*  What is your sense of [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5252.74s)]
*  the state of the russian opposition [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5254.74s)]
*  Um [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5256.74s)]
*  At this moment in time and also just kind of your sense of you know, we've been focused a lot on the positive [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5257.78s)]
*  Narrative for pudin. I mean he has suffered enormous losses [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5263.94s)]
*  Uh on the battlefield that's inevitably going to have some impact in russian communities, uh going forward [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5267.38s)]
*  um, how [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5274.66s)]
*  How would you characterize the state of internal russian politics at this moment? [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5276.179999999999s)]
*  Uh related to kind of putin's control and and in the absence of an opposition or the potential for there to be [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5280.34s)]
*  Um, if not opposition at least dissatisfaction with how things are going there the satisfaction in in russia such as there has has been [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5288.5s)]
*  Any it's mostly been with uh the economic impacts of the war rather than the actual war itself if you [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5296.34s)]
*  um, there's a great russian sociologist, uh, greg yudin who [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5304.9s)]
*  Has this analogy that for most russians the war is is like rain, you know [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5309.86s)]
*  You you don't like the rain you you want to avoid it best as you can [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5313.94s)]
*  But you think that it's this sort of you know thing imposed on you externally that is completely [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5317.86s)]
*  Beyond your your control to do anything about and that atomization has existed at russian society [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5323.0599999999995s)]
*  For for centuries because of the the way that the you know state has been formed and reformed the way that russians have been [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5328.58s)]
*  Have been ruled. It's uh very different from from a country like ukraine [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5334.66s)]
*  and uh [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5339.320000000001s)]
*  In in terms of what dissatisfaction that that uh, you know, there could be over over people [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5341.400000000001s)]
*  Dying in the war you have to remember that it was mostly around mobilization when when people were were being forcibly drafted into the army [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5347.8s)]
*  They were you know hundreds of thousands of them fled the country to to try to escape that but now [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5356.6s)]
*  Uh what they switched to and they've been able to do it pretty successfully and more or less replace men [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5363.160000000001s)]
*  Uh cash leaves the front lines with with new recruits just by paying people you you have these enormous payouts that are [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5370.52s)]
*  uh bigger than a a a year's salary in uh on average in in a lot of these pretty poor regions where most of the recruiting [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5378.04s)]
*  is is concentrated and [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5387.64s)]
*  The that combined with the low [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5389.96s)]
*  value that's that's been been placed on on human life in in in russian society that has encouraged a lot of people to [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5393.0s)]
*  to sign up and if you if you go on instagram and tiktok there there's this whole subgenre of of posts of the uh, [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5401.88s)]
*  the wives of of these guys in uh on on the days that the payments come in for for when they're fighting or [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5407.400000000001s)]
*  when they get the payments for [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5414.280000000001s)]
*  uh [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5416.4400000000005s)]
*  For their husbands being injured or killed at the front they they all go shopping [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5417.88s)]
*  and uh, you know there there has been a consumer boom in in russia that has been driven in large part by [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5422.04s)]
*  this this war spending so [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5428.04s)]
*  That that doesn't mean that there isn't a part of russian society that is uh actively against the war [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5430.84s)]
*  but it's uh never been the majority the the uh majority has always been you know passive [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5437.64s)]
*  And uh, the people who are actively against the war have been very effectively suppressed [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5444.2s)]
*  there are hundreds and hundreds of hundreds of political prisoners just um, [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5448.44s)]
*  we we we know people people like davalny and uh some of some of the [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5452.2s)]
*  dissidents who were freed in the evangirskivich exchange like elia yashin lody mccarramorosa [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5456.919999999999s)]
*  but there are hundreds and hundreds of ordinary people who in in [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5462.28s)]
*  The far-flung bits of russia who just got picked up because police have a quota they they said something [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5465.5599999999995s)]
*  On on social media or or at a bus stop or uh in in some sort of private setting and uh, [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5470.44s)]
*  Someone someone informed on them and uh, they're they're now in prison serving these often very draconian sentences [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5478.28s)]
*  uh, so [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5484.36s)]
*  any any kind of real opposition to to how things are [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5486.2s)]
*  uh going on is uh [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5490.28s)]
*  Pretty much impossible [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5492.92s)]
*  And for the opposition that are outside the country there they're in a very sad state right now [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5494.44s)]
*  uh because um [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5499.24s)]
*  You know the longer this goes on the greater disconnect they have with uh with with russian society [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5502.2s)]
*  They have been largely unable to swing that [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5508.2s)]
*  Navalny's death was obviously an enormous blow and uh for [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5513.48s)]
*  Those of you who have read about the the bolsheviks and the mencheviks and the and the various other [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5519.64s)]
*  Anti-zaris leftist groups in in the early 20th century in exile, uh, or or soviet dissidents [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5525.08s)]
*  You know what comes as a surprise that they seem to spend most of their time fighting each other [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5531.16s)]
*  over over various uh [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5536.200000000001s)]
*  Sites and and perceived differences and things like that that are just a really big turnoff to to the average [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5538.04s)]
*  russian or the uh, you know the average whether they're in russia or excel, I think it's also worth making the point [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5544.92s)]
*  that uh [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5551.96s)]
*  Really one of one of the most uh, you know active groups in in russian society in in trying to [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5553.64s)]
*  uh [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5562.52s)]
*  Make sure that the truth about the war that gets uh, it gets out it has been the the media and [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5566.280000000001s)]
*  One thing you're seeing at the moment with trump's attack on usaid firstly that uh so much of the exiled [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5572.76s)]
*  Uh russian media that has you know from the country because you go to jail for telling the truth about [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5580.12s)]
*  About the war the the extent to which they [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5585.4s)]
*  Were dependent on funding. I think many of them without them even necessarily [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5588.84s)]
*  realizing it just how how dependent it all was on on usaid [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5593.22s)]
*  and uh and and secondly [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5597.8s)]
*  You know, they they also have have the same problem that it just gets harder and harder to reach audiences [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5601.08s)]
*  people are reluctant to speak and uh, and and they're really [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5605.72s)]
*  struggling and uh, so it's it's it's a pretty sad scenario all around for for those people I would say [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG6ukBB8td8&t=5610.12s)]
