# Trump’s Middle East Trip Triggers Massive Corruption Uproar
**Pod Save the World:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ)
*  Welcome to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Ben Rhodes. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2.0s)]
*  Don't smile at me that way. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3.12s)]
*  Why are you smiling at me? This is one of the best days of my life in the last 25 years. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4.64s)]
*  You hurt Jason Tatum. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  We did not hurt Jason Tatum. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=10.32s)]
*  You tore his Achilles. It was a dirty pool. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=11.6s)]
*  And that was fine. It was a terrible injury though. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I felt bad. It was like one of the greatest. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=15.36s)]
*  You didn't feel that bad. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=19.6s)]
*  I mean, I felt bad mainly because you want to beat the team full strength. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=20.64s)]
*  Mm. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=24.96s)]
*  Cocky. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=25.6s)]
*  Yeah. That's where we were at by the fourth quarter. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=26.32s)]
*  I also like Jason Tatum. I feel like he's gotten kind of a bad rap. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=28.48s)]
*  He catches a lot of shit. People say he doesn't have aura. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=31.84s)]
*  They think he sometimes doesn't seem like he wants the ball at the end of games. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  Maybe we jack up too many threes. All of that. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=38.64s)]
*  There have been times when it's true, but also he won an NBA final. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=41.44s)]
*  He did. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=44.64s)]
*  Now he's no Jalen Brunson who wants the ball in every clutch situation and tends to hit the shots. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=46.08s)]
*  But we're still rooting for him. We wish him the best. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  I want you to know who you're hurting with this. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=56.72s)]
*  This is an amazing clip I saw released on Twitter, Ben. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=59.28s)]
*  This is a guy named Frank Murray, president of the Ironworkers Local 7. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=61.76s)]
*  He's talking about Kilmar Arbrego Garcia. Listen to this man. Listen to your hurting. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=64.96s)]
*  Who you're hurting. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=68.4s)]
*  It's time for us to stand up for our brother Kilmar and for all the people that have been [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=69.92s)]
*  unjustly deported. Bring our brother Kilmar home. My name is Frank Murray. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=73.68s)]
*  I'm the president of the Local 7 Ironworkers. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=78.4s)]
*  That is the best Boston accent I've ever heard. I don't know Frank Murray, but I love him. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=80.88s)]
*  It's better than Matt Damon and Ben Affleck and Gabriel Honning. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=85.12s)]
*  He's wearing a socks hat in this video too. Of course he is. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=87.92s)]
*  I just sit at home watching clips of drunk Knicks fans on Seventh Avenue after games. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So that's basically what I do at night these days. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  Okay. Well, you know, we got different things going on, but we have a great show today. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=100.4s)]
*  We do have a good show. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=104.80000000000001s)]
*  We're going to talk a lot about president Trump's first foreign trip. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  He's going to, he's in Saudi Arabia. He's going to Qatar. He's going to the UAE. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=109.76s)]
*  There's a big announcement, some big news on Syria policy that we're going to dig into, Ben. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=113.92s)]
*  We're going to talk about how the future of AI policy kind of looms large in the background [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  of this trip. We'll of course talk about corruption. We're also going to cover what this trip tells us [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=121.68s)]
*  about Trump's relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu and the latest news on [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  the Iran nuclear talks. Then we're going to talk about why Trump caved to China in the trade war. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=131.76s)]
*  What scared the administration into getting involved in diplomacy with India and Pakistan [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=138.24s)]
*  to stop the fighting there? Hope for a possible meeting between Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=142.72s)]
*  and president Putin this week. That would be big. See? Yeah. Yeah, we'll see. We'll talk about the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=147.76s)]
*  new Pope. What he means for America and the world. How our immigration policy here in the U.S. somehow [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=152.4s)]
*  got more racist. And then you're going to hear my interview with Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=157.6s)]
*  about the historic corruption happening in plain sight during Trump's trip. What it means for [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=162.48s)]
*  U.S. foreign policy and what Congress can do about it. Chris Murphy always brings the takes. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=168.0s)]
*  He does bring lethal efficiency. I also had a tight interview. I love that. It was like 19 minutes. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=174.88s)]
*  I do appreciate though that he was saying, you know, before we started recording that [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=180.56s)]
*  for a while it seemed hard to get people to pay attention to like the kind of crypto corruption [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=184.24s)]
*  piece. But obviously when you give someone a 400 million dollar airplane like Qatar just did, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  certainly that. Yeah. Although again, I'd like to say that this is a beat that we've been on for [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=193.36s)]
*  a while. And the reality is, yeah, sure. The plane is attention grabbing. But the two billion dollars [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=198.96s)]
*  gifted to Jared Kushner and the hundreds of millions of dollars in crypto. I mean, I know [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=205.36s)]
*  you covered this with Chris Murphy, but it's useful that a plane can encapsulate things. But [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=210.4s)]
*  that is kind of the tip of the iceberg here. It's definitely the tip of the iceberg. You do sort of [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=216.08s)]
*  sometimes need an image or an object or a video clip, you know, like John Edwards getting his [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=219.76s)]
*  haircut or whatever the kind of political moment might be to focus. Boy, that was a callback. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=225.12s)]
*  Yeah. That was from someone who worked for John Edwards. That one hurt that cut deep. All right, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=230.16s)]
*  Ben, let's dig into this trip. So this is Trump's first official foreign trip. I say official because [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=234.64s)]
*  he did go to the Pope's funeral, but that doesn't count because it wasn't like what they planned to [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=239.84s)]
*  do first. As we record, Trump is in Saudi Arabia. Then he goes to Qatar and finally the UAE. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=244.0s)]
*  Listeners may remember that Trump's first foreign trip back in 2017 also started in Saudi Arabia. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=249.12s)]
*  But then he went on to Israel with Italy for another meeting with the Pope. I think G7 was there. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  And then to Brussels for NATO meetings. This is just a tour of Gulf monarchies. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. His favorite places on earth. Not a democracy in sight, not a voter in sight. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=264.64s)]
*  And it probably tells you everything you need to know about the way Trump is trying to kind of [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  reorient our foreign policy or realign the United States globally. More on that in a second. So [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=272.8s)]
*  Senator Murphy will get into the Bonanza piece that was kicked off by the Qataris giving Trump [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=278.4s)]
*  a 747-8 that he's going to pretend to use as Air Force One and then take with him after he [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=283.44s)]
*  leaves office. That's the best part. Well, let's just talk about that for a second. I want to get [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=288.8s)]
*  to the Syria piece. But like the idea that you could take a plane from a foreign government and [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=293.04s)]
*  use it as Air Force One is so just ludicrous on its face. Like the security considerations alone [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=297.6s)]
*  are just, it's unworkable. It's unfeasible. Yeah. I think that the point of this trip though [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=302.32s)]
*  is that the corruption is like a feature, not a bug of the entire Trump administration. And I will [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=308.16s)]
*  give credit where it's due to the Gulf Arabs. They get that. They get it. So they're not pretending, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=312.08000000000004s)]
*  they're not trying to hide the ball here. The Saudis writing checks, the Emiratis put a bunch [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=317.76000000000005s)]
*  of money into Trump coin, the Qataris are gifting a plane. They understand exactly who they're [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=322.56s)]
*  dealing with. And so it's hard to hold it against them when Trump is just essentially making the [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=328.24s)]
*  United States and its foreign policy for sale. And so you have to think of this corruption, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=334.88s)]
*  not as like a few bad actors or not as some side deal. Like this is core to the Trump presidency [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=340.96s)]
*  here. And that's what is on flagrant display. And yeah, Air Force One, it's hard for me to even get [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=347.04s)]
*  my mind around the security issues, obviously. But also just the sense of, it's not, I mean, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=353.68s)]
*  I remember I wrote about this in my first book, Tommy. It's not like the plane of an individual, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=363.44s)]
*  it's the plane of an office. I mean, I remember being on Air Force One the first time, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=369.36s)]
*  and it was like the president's 15 minutes out, the president's five minutes out, the president's [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=374.32s)]
*  on board, and then Obama comes on board. They don't say even President Obama. It's like, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=378.0s)]
*  it's the office of the presidency's plane. And then I remember I had to do some remarks, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=381.52s)]
*  and I went to use this, remember those giant computers that were like nailed down to like a [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=386.72s)]
*  desk in the back, and I booted up and there was a set of remarks on the desktop that were George [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=391.36s)]
*  W. Bush's remarks delivered after Russia invaded Georgia. Oh, wow. And it was a very like- It's [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=396.72s)]
*  probably like the last speech someone edited on the computer, right? It was. Yeah, because he was at [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=402.56s)]
*  the Olympics in the summer. It was a very humbling experience because it definitely reminded me that [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=406.0s)]
*  I was like a temporary employee on this plane, that it wasn't mine, obviously, wasn't even [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=411.04s)]
*  President Obama's, right? And that's kind of missing, obviously, in the Trump conception [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=415.52000000000004s)]
*  of the presidency. Yeah. What is Trump going to like uproot the White House, put it on blocks, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=420.0s)]
*  roll it away? Yeah, he'll try. Yeah, it's absurd. It's outrageous. But let's start with the trip [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=425.44s)]
*  because there was a big announcement about Syria policy that Trump made in his speech earlier today [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=431.6s)]
*  in Riyadh. Let's listen. I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=436.96s)]
*  give them a chance at great this. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=443.03999999999996s)]
*  So it's quick there. It was a lot of applause. You got like 45 seconds of applause. Trump also [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=452.15999999999997s)]
*  told reporters that he's going to meet with Ahmed Al-Shara, the new president of Syria, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=455.91999999999996s)]
*  while he's in Saudi Arabia. I think Rubio is going to meet with the Syrian foreign minister [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=459.52s)]
*  later this week in Turkey, if Steve Wicoff will let him. We don't know all the details [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=463.12s)]
*  for how these sanctions relief itself will work. Like if they're lifting sanctions, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=468.08s)]
*  if there's just a pause on them, if they're going to ask Congress to do something. But either way, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=472.4s)]
*  it's a very big deal. We've discussed on the show many times the fact that these sanctions [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=475.91999999999996s)]
*  were put in place to punish the Assad regime and the keeping sanctions on the people who deposed [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=480.79999999999995s)]
*  Assad is madness. Yeah. And it was destined to destroy the country or prevent them from getting [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=485.67999999999995s)]
*  off their feet economically. So I think Trump deserves a lot of credit for this decision. It [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=491.12s)]
*  was politically difficult to take sanctions off someone who admits he was part of al-Qaeda and [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=494.79999999999995s)]
*  ISIS at one point. You know that Netanyahu probably hates this decision, but it's [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=500.96s)]
*  unequivocally the right thing to do. Ben, your thoughts on this policy change and just the [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=505.59999999999997s)]
*  itinerary for this trip generally. First of all, the applause is interesting because [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=510.64s)]
*  people clapped for about 25 seconds and then Mohammed bin Salman stood up and everybody else [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=515.76s)]
*  in the room stood up. I mean, this is a royal court, right? Like everybody's watching and [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=522.0799999999999s)]
*  if that guy stands up, you have better get your ass up and applaud. You know, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=526.64s)]
*  the bone sauce. That was interesting. And I think clearly MBS was one of the Arab leaders who was [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=530.16s)]
*  pushing for this decision too. So it kind of further reinforces his thought. That said, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=536.0s)]
*  it's exactly the right decision. It's hard to overstate how impossible it was going to be [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=542.16s)]
*  for Syria to have any chance at viability as a state with the continued sanctions. We've [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=547.5999999999999s)]
*  talked about this. You just cannot attract any investment, any reconstruction funding, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=553.84s)]
*  anything whatsoever if businesses are worried or foreign governments are worried that, you know, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=559.0400000000001s)]
*  that money could get entrapped in sanctions or could, you know, be seen as a sanctions violation. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=564.4s)]
*  And so this opens the door for Syria to have a chance. And it's so clearly the right decision. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=570.72s)]
*  And people may start to think that we harp on Joe Biden, but I don't know why Joe Biden didn't do [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=578.2399999999999s)]
*  this. Like this just shows you too. Like I don't like Trump's motivations for lots of things he [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=584.88s)]
*  does. But he's one thing you will say is he's not like tied to this like constant fear of some bad [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=592.88s)]
*  faith right wing attacks. Yeah. Bad faith. Well, bad faith right wing attacks or kind of stupid, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=601.28s)]
*  you know, blob type, you know, well, we don't do this. So we must leverage the sanctions for [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=606.88s)]
*  blah, blah, blah, you know, no, sometimes you just have to try something different and continuing to [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=611.92s)]
*  sanction a country because of the sanctions you've put in place for the dictator who's no longer [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=616.48s)]
*  there makes no sense. Now we'll see how this goes. We don't know if Ahmed Alshara is going [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=621.6s)]
*  to end up governing in an inclusive way. We'll see. But I mean, as we've said about this topic [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=627.52s)]
*  in the past, you can always put those sanctions back in place if they do something terrible, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=632.4s)]
*  you know, but why not test and see if this new government can deliver on some of its promises? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=636.88s)]
*  They have huge challenges, not the least a largely destroyed set of infrastructure. They have Israel [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=642.24s)]
*  like bombing and occupying parts of their country. So this this gives them a chance. And hopefully [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=648.9599999999999s)]
*  what this can also do is unlock a ton of money from the Gulf, right? I mean, if the Gulf Arab [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=655.6s)]
*  States, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE want to plow money in there, that's all to the better. That's [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=660.8s)]
*  a good good way for them to spend their money. The one thing I'd say about the itineraries, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=666.16s)]
*  you're right. It's it's just the three Gulf countries. And first, that is the world that [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=669.4399999999999s)]
*  Trump likes. And yeah, we talked about the corruption piece, but even just in terms of [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=674.3199999999999s)]
*  transactionalism, he likes transactional foreign policy. There are no rules. There's no rules based [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=677.76s)]
*  order. There's no norms. There's no values proposition. We're just dealing with wealthy [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=683.68s)]
*  countries that can invest in things and can move things quickly. And Trump likes that. I will say, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=688.88s)]
*  and we'll allow ourselves to do the what if Obama did this? You know, what if any Democrat did this? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=697.04s)]
*  I remember Obama's first trip to the Middle East. We went to Saudi Arabia and Egypt and and I'm [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=702.4s)]
*  still hearing about from a pack about how we didn't go to Israel. Look, they are cutting Israel out of [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=709.12s)]
*  Iran talks. They clearly made this decision, which Israel wouldn't like on Syria because Israel's [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=714.56s)]
*  bombing this government. They aren't going to Israel on this trip. So I don't think that means [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=719.76s)]
*  that Trump gives a shit about the Palestinians. He doesn't. But it does mean that he isn't like [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=725.1199999999999s)]
*  going to check everything with Bibi Netanyahu first, which, by the way, Joe Biden also did. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=730.56s)]
*  So so like I think we can be unburdened by that kind of foreign policy. Yeah, I want to dig more [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=735.52s)]
*  into this Israel piece because I agree with you. It's really interesting. I like yeah, I like [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=741.6s)]
*  tweeted something praising Trump's decision and people were like, well, actually me being like, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=744.64s)]
*  oh, Shara offered to build a Trump Tower in Damascus. That shit. Yeah, I mean, if you wanted [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=750.64s)]
*  to get the sanctions for your country, like I'd be offering to build fucking whatever. I don't [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=757.44s)]
*  think this is why Trump made the decision. I agree with you. MBS and all these golf, that's clearly [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=762.16s)]
*  push hard for this decision and clearly push for it to be announced during the Riyadh portion of [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=767.44s)]
*  the trip. Alshara did just meet with Emmanuel Macron in Paris, so I think there will be a lot [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=772.48s)]
*  of global support for this decision. Ben, this is another clip from President Trump's speech today, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=777.9200000000001s)]
*  though, that I think kind of made both of us perk up. And it's crucial for the wider world to know [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=783.7600000000001s)]
*  this great transformation has not come from Western intervention, or flying people in [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=790.24s)]
*  beautiful planes, giving you lectures on how to live and how to govern your own affairs. No, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=799.36s)]
*  the gleaming marvels of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi were not created by the so-called nation builders, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=805.12s)]
*  neo cons or liberal nonprofits like those who spent trillions and trillions of dollars failing [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=811.52s)]
*  to develop. Kabal, Baghdad, in the end, the so-called nation builders wrecked far more [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=818.48s)]
*  nations than they built. And the interventionalists were intervening in complex societies [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=826.64s)]
*  that they did not even understand themselves. They told you how to do it, but they had no idea how [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=833.76s)]
*  to do it themselves. So to your point earlier, like I do like that Trump not only doesn't give [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=839.36s)]
*  a shit what the neo cons and the blob think, he views it as politically advantageous to slap [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=846.24s)]
*  them around regularly. So applauding that. I do think we should probably be honest that the part [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=851.8399999999999s)]
*  about not giving lectures to foreign leaders or the Americans not giving lectures is probably [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=857.28s)]
*  Trump just saying, I don't give a shit about human rights. You don't give a shit about human [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=861.8399999999999s)]
*  rights. We're not going to talk about that today. And the fact that human rights is totally off the [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=864.9599999999999s)]
*  table was hammered home by the CEO guest list, which included the, you know, Elon Musk, the head [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=868.8s)]
*  of BlackRock, the head of Amazon, the head of Nvidia, Sam Altman from OpenAI, Reid Hoffman. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=874.96s)]
*  You and I are old enough now to remember the 2018 Saudi Davos in the desert conference [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=881.52s)]
*  right after Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince, had ordered the execution of a journalist named [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=888.5600000000001s)]
*  Jamal Khashoggi and this international effort to isolate MBS and the Saudis. And that's gone. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=893.6s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Look, first of all, it's kind of funny when he says Cabal for Kabul, I guess, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=901.44s)]
*  struggling with some words, internationalists. But let's put that aside. So you meant you. Yeah. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=908.64s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, the thing here's the thing about Trump. I obviously share a bunch of his views [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=914.88s)]
*  about the pointlessness of American military intervention in Iraq, about the kind of corruption [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=922.1600000000001s)]
*  and cluelessness of aspects of the military intervention in Afghanistan. I do work with [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=929.92s)]
*  liberal nonprofits and I'm not aware of the trillions of dollars that the liberal nonprofits [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=936.0799999999999s)]
*  have. It'd be nice if we did. But I'll say this. While I share some of those critiques, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=939.52s)]
*  he's missing the fact that there's an alternative between essentially, you know, neocons or whatever [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=945.68s)]
*  you want to call them who want to kind of think that they can engineer Middle Eastern politics [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=953.28s)]
*  from the US military and like a Mohammed bin Salman who, you know, let's face it, why is there [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=957.68s)]
*  marble in Saudi Arabia? It's just because there's a lot of oil in Saudi Arabia. It's not like he [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=966.7199999999999s)]
*  discovered some ideas that are not printing money, right? There's a third way, which is [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=971.12s)]
*  like Arab peoples themselves making decisions, not Americans showing up there and not like just [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=977.68s)]
*  a small number of really rich people making those decisions. And by the way, that doesn't have to [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=984.08s)]
*  look like yours and my exact view of democracy. But what continues to be missing from this is [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=989.2s)]
*  the participation of people in these countries in some fashion, right? It may not be multi-party [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=995.9200000000001s)]
*  elections next year, but by any stretch, you know, it's not like the people in Saudi Arabia [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1000.8000000000001s)]
*  have a lot of say in what goes on in their lives. And so we shouldn't let- [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1005.44s)]
*  Or the Emiratis. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1009.76s)]
*  Exactly. So we shouldn't let his accurate disregard for American interventionism lead you to believe [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1011.1999999999999s)]
*  that the only alternative is a bunch of, let's face it, a bunch of fucking white American CEOs [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1019.1999999999999s)]
*  and, you know, a bunch of Royals sitting around and deciding everything themselves either. There [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1024.8799999999999s)]
*  needs to be a voice for people in these discussions in this part of the world and that's missing. And [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1029.36s)]
*  the fact that you have Elon Musk there and Sam Altman and all these other people, you know, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1035.44s)]
*  that's not out of some earnest interest in the human wellbeing of the people of the Middle East. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1040.96s)]
*  That's because they want some of this money. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1046.3200000000002s)]
*  Purely financial. Yeah. I mean, so President Biden put in place global restrictions on the export of [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1048.0s)]
*  AI, artificial intelligence chips. So he allowed unlimited AI chip sales to about 18 countries, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1054.16s)]
*  allies like the UK and Germany. And then he blocked sales to China, Iran, sort of enemies. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1060.32s)]
*  And then all other countries, including the Saudis, the UAE and Qatar had caps. I believe all those [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1066.0s)]
*  countries want to get rid of those caps. And that's probably the kind of thing you would imagine [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1071.1999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump trading for, say, a nice new airplane. Yes. And look, this is a really [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1075.1999999999998s)]
*  interesting issue. And, you know, I've mentioned this before, full disclosure, I've done some [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1081.6s)]
*  work over the years for Microsoft, which is obviously involved in this. But I think there's [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1085.92s)]
*  somewhere in between what Trump is doing and what Biden was doing, right? Which is that [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1092.4s)]
*  Biden was putting like really tight restrictions on the export of any American AI technology. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1096.96s)]
*  And I actually think that in the long run, that was kind of futile because we saw, I mean, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1104.4s)]
*  in China, right, with DeepSeek that we put all these restrictions on chips going into China, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1109.1200000000001s)]
*  on technology going to China. And guess what the Chinese did? With a lot less money, right, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1113.92s)]
*  like a few tens of millions of dollars instead of tens of billions of dollars, they were basically [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1119.04s)]
*  able to take some of the open source models that were released, right? So Facebook released its [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1123.1200000000001s)]
*  Lama AI model. So we kind of look at that, reverse engineer it. All you need is a little bit of [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1128.5600000000002s)]
*  computing power. You don't need massive GPUs. And lo and behold, they put out a DeepSeek model that [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1133.28s)]
*  is pretty comparable in quality to most of the American AI. So I think it is a futile [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1139.36s)]
*  task to suggest that we're somehow going to build some giant wall around AI because [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1145.84s)]
*  smart people can just figure it out. And when they kind of look at what is already released [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1150.32s)]
*  and what is available. And I frankly think that if we build too high a wall around American AI, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1154.6399999999999s)]
*  well then the rest of the world is just going to buy Chinese AI. I truly think that's where this [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1161.04s)]
*  would go. Now, the flip side is you can still try to put some guardrails about how it moves out in [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1165.2s)]
*  the world. Like the first stuff that moves out is the software and then the applications. And then [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1171.76s)]
*  you allow kind of training runs on these models to take place in different places. There's something [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1176.48s)]
*  in between just allowing as many chips to flow into anywhere in the world and restricting it [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1180.88s)]
*  totally. And I think I land in the middle of that space Trump probably because he's getting [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1189.36s)]
*  huge investments from these countries. It seems like he's moving in the other direction. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1195.84s)]
*  Yeah. You're a third way guy. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1199.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. I'm a third way guy on this one. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1200.24s)]
*  So Ben, you mentioned that Trump is skipping Israel on this trip. That has increased this chatter [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1202.9599999999998s)]
*  about a rift potentially between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Bivin and Yahoo. And as you [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1208.4799999999998s)]
*  mentioned, when you look at some of the recent moves out of the Trump administration, it sort [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1213.6799999999998s)]
*  of seems to be the case. I mean, there's just the existence of the Iran nuclear talks led by Steve [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1217.68s)]
*  Witkoff is going to piss Bivin and Yahoo off. Witkoff, who is also just like the emissary [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1223.44s)]
*  doing everything around the world, he also reportedly told the families of Israeli hostages [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1230.24s)]
*  that Israel is not willing to end the war and it's prolonging the fighting despite there being no [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1235.1200000000001s)]
*  security upside, which is unequivocally true, but a tough thing to say. According to BBC, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1239.76s)]
*  Witkoff orchestrated the release of Adon Alexander, this final American hostage [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1245.28s)]
*  who was released a couple of days ago with the final American week held in Gaza. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1249.84s)]
*  And he did it via a back channel with someone talking directly to Hamas. And I guess the [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1254.08s)]
*  Israelis didn't learn about it until Sunday night. The Axios just reported that the Israelis didn't [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1258.6399999999999s)]
*  learn about this from the White House, but from their intelligence services. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1263.44s)]
*  My guess is Qatar might have been that. I don't know, but I mean, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1266.56s)]
*  there's not a lot of addresses. It's not that big of a secret. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1271.12s)]
*  The Trump ceasefire agreement with the Houthis only requires the Houthis to stop firing at US [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1275.28s)]
*  ships, not at Israel. There's talk of cutting a civilian nuclear deal with the Saudis outside of [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1279.44s)]
*  an agreement to normalize relations with Israel. There are some Nagu Republican types that are [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1284.72s)]
*  fighting these crazy efforts in Congress to criminalize boycotts of Israel in the United [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1290.32s)]
*  States. So, you know, at the end of the day, these guys are both right-wing autocrats. Like, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1296.08s)]
*  I'm sure they'll patch things up by hating on some third group somehow. But it is fascinating [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1300.32s)]
*  to watch Trump ice out Netanyahu a bit here. And it does, you know, I don't want to pile on, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1305.4399999999998s)]
*  but it does annoy me that the Biden administration never told Bibi to fuck off. And Trump's doing it [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1310.6399999999999s)]
*  over and over and over. One Trump advisor described Trump's treatment of Netanyahu as, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1315.84s)]
*  quote, one notch above the Zelensky meeting. Yeah. And the interesting thing is Netanyahu [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1320.56s)]
*  has nowhere to go. Right. Because he's not going to go embrace the Democrats. You know, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1327.84s)]
*  that's it just shows you the like he has one play to run in American politics. And it's to [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1332.24s)]
*  like the right wing, the Republican Party. And all of a sudden, like Trump is self-interested [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1337.4399999999998s)]
*  and doesn't really give a shit. And if you're like the, you know, foundation for the defense [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1342.48s)]
*  of democracies, you're one of these kind of right wing anti Iran pro-Israel think tanks, like, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1346.9599999999998s)]
*  you don't really know what to do with this. You know, like who you mad at, right? Because [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1352.8s)]
*  they can't pick a fight with Trump because there's no again, there's nowhere else for them to go. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1356.5600000000002s)]
*  So it's an interesting dynamic to watch again, like at the end of the day, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1360.8000000000002s)]
*  I think what it could get you is like, hopefully an Iran deal, which rationally [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1364.8000000000002s)]
*  avoids like a major war over the Iranian nuclear program. I don't think it's ever going to lead [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1368.3200000000002s)]
*  anywhere good for the Palestinians because I don't think Trump gives a shit about the Palestinians. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1372.72s)]
*  I mean, unless, you know, again, the Arabs decide to push him harder on that. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1376.4s)]
*  Well, Wyckoff met with Netanyahu on Monday. Israel is now sending a delegation to Qatar [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1380.88s)]
*  for negotiations this week. Trump reportedly wants to announce a deal on his trip. I mean, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1385.04s)]
*  that's just, it's not going to happen. And also Bibi has set a deadline for the end of this week [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1389.36s)]
*  where, you know, he's claiming that he'll have the IDF conduct a ground invasion unless there's a [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1394.32s)]
*  hostage release or some deal is cut. But I just saw a report that in Al Jazeera that Netanyahu [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1400.08s)]
*  told a bunch of wounded Israeli soldiers that there's quote, no way Israel will stop the war [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1405.04s)]
*  in Gaza. Even if a deal is reached to release the hostages. He said, quote, we'll take them and then [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1409.52s)]
*  we'll go in, but there will be no way we will stop the war. End quote. Yeah. But I, Israel's [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1414.64s)]
*  going to be like increasingly isolated. I mean, they've, they've already lost global public opinion. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1422.0s)]
*  I guess I'd say this to some of the kind of people who've been dead enders in supporting [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1427.44s)]
*  Israel's horrific and morally abhorrent and strategically disastrous Gaza policy. And somehow [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1432.48s)]
*  think that, you know, that, that Trump maybe is good on this issue or something. I mean, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1439.36s)]
*  this, what part of what this shows is the whole focus on antisemitism on American campuses [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1446.4799999999998s)]
*  as a means of like, you know, quashing these universities and deporting people that you don't [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1454.1599999999999s)]
*  like is fucking bullshit. You know, like, like Trump doesn't believe that he's just using that [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1460.0s)]
*  as a vehicle to break universities he doesn't like and to deport Brown people, you know? And so [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1465.6000000000001s)]
*  this actually proves what a lie it is that, that their policies are rooted in some like, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1472.64s)]
*  you know, across the board embrace of Netanyahu's agenda. No, they embrace it when it's convenient [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1477.68s)]
*  for them, like when they want to deport people in this country and, you know, they could kind of care [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1483.76s)]
*  less when it comes to some other things Netanyahu is doing. So I just think this is, you know, you, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1487.92s)]
*  you don't see that this is leading towards the wholesale isolation of Israel going forward. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1495.2s)]
*  You're just not paying attention. Yeah. Also like for 18 months, anytime you tweet or criticize the [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1500.64s)]
*  Israeli conduct in Gaza, the rejoinder is always, well, if Hamas released the hostages, the war [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1506.0800000000002s)]
*  would be over. And now Netanyahu is saying, actually, that's not the case. That's just not [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1510.72s)]
*  the case. It's never been the case. It's never been the case. And it's been so obvious. Yeah, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1513.68s)]
*  it's been totally obvious. So then Iran is, is as always looming large behind the scenes on this [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1516.64s)]
*  trip, not just because Trump is pissing them off by floating the idea of renaming the Persian Gulf [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1521.68s)]
*  to the Arabian Gulf. Do you support this idea? I don't. But I told you that the Pentagon used [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1527.6000000000001s)]
*  to always call it the Arabian Gulf. And if we, when we were in the situation meetings and I'd have to [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1533.6000000000001s)]
*  do what like, so like the Pentagon has already decided it's the Arabian Gulf. They didn't do [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1538.0s)]
*  Gulf of America though. No, that's true. So over the weekend, there were some US Iran talks in Oman. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1543.28s)]
*  The results seems to go very differently depending on who you listen to. Steve [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1548.8s)]
*  Witkoff called them encouraging. The Iranian foreign minister said the conversations were, [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1553.68s)]
*  quote, difficult but useful. Ahead of the talks, here's what Witkoff had to say to Breitbart. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1558.64s)]
*  The Iranians cannot have a bomb. And they have stated back that they don't want one. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1564.4s)]
*  So we're going to, for the purposes of this discussion, accept them at their word that [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1569.36s)]
*  that's actually how they feel. If that's how they feel, then their enrichment facilities have [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1573.36s)]
*  to be dismantled. They cannot have centrifuges. They have to down blend all of their, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1579.6799999999998s)]
*  all of their fuel that they have there, send it to a far away place. But an enrichment program [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1587.04s)]
*  can never exist in the state of Iran ever again. And they, that's our red line. We're never doing [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1592.56s)]
*  a JCPOA deal where sanctions come off and there's no sun setting of their obligations. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1597.92s)]
*  So that doesn't make sense. That was a mismatched procedure in JCPOA. We believe that they cannot [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1606.88s)]
*  have enrichment. They cannot have centrifuges. They cannot have anything that allows them to [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1616.16s)]
*  build a weapon. So the Iranian foreign minister had this to say on Iranian state TV, quote, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1622.48s)]
*  enrichment is an issue that Iran will not give up and there's no room for compromise on it. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1628.32s)]
*  However, its dimensions, levels or amounts might change for a period to allow confidence building. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1632.96s)]
*  He also said, quote, contradictory positions taken by the U.S. in the media is not acceptable [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1638.48s)]
*  to us as they do not help in negotiations. CNN quoted an Iranian source who also said the American [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1643.1200000000001s)]
*  side is basically not ready for meaningful technical and political talks, adding that the [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1648.16s)]
*  U.S. gives, quote, short in general answers to questions, ignores main proposals and constantly [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1652.16s)]
*  changes its position throughout the negotiation. So let's decode those statements quickly. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1657.2s)]
*  Listeners might remember a few weeks back, Wittkopf did an interview where he said Iran [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1662.48s)]
*  can enrich nuclear material to a level of 3.5%. Why does that matter? Natural uranium has a small [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1666.88s)]
*  amount of fissile material in it. That's the material that you can split with a nuclear reaction [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1673.52s)]
*  to create energy. Nuclear scientists enrich uranium to get higher concentrations of fissile material [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1678.08s)]
*  for different purposes. So 90% enriched uranium is considered weapons grade. 20% enriched could be [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1683.44s)]
*  useful for research and medical purposes. 3.5% enriched uranium is used for nuclear energy. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1688.6399999999999s)]
*  So in that quote, Wittkopf was saying Iran can enrich uranium for civilian nuclear power plant [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1694.8799999999999s)]
*  use. But after he said that, Wittkopf got smacked down. He had to walk back those comments [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1700.96s)]
*  and say what I meant was Iran can have a civilian nuclear power infrastructure, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1706.64s)]
*  but they have to purchase the uranium from a third country. They can't enrich it. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1711.44s)]
*  So that's, I think, what the Iranians mean when they're calling out contradictory positions taken [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1715.52s)]
*  by the U.S. and the media. Ben, do you believe the Iranians when they say that having the [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1719.68s)]
*  enrichment capacity is a red line for them? And if so, why do you feel that way? Why do you think [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1724.08s)]
*  they feel that way? Because you hear like the Marco Rubios of the world argue that no country [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1730.16s)]
*  in the world has an enrichment program without a nuclear weapons program, too. You can have a [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1735.0400000000002s)]
*  civilian nuclear program and just say purchase enriched uranium from Russia, right, to fuel it. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1740.48s)]
*  So first of all, I believe the Iranians, having lived through Iranian negotiations on the nuclear [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1748.96s)]
*  program, first of all, the Breitbart interview is very triggering to me because Breitbart, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1755.0400000000002s)]
*  I mean, must have written hundreds of articles. One trillion articles. One trillion articles just [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1759.6000000000001s)]
*  savaging the JCPOA before, during, and after it was concluded. And now they're like just credulously [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1764.08s)]
*  probably sitting there and like kind of regurgitating what Steve Wichau says. I also [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1772.48s)]
*  hate that he puts a emphasis on like they committed to never developing nuclear weapon. That text was [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1776.24s)]
*  in the JCPOA. I know. They never, and that was permanent, by the way. Like it was a permanent [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1780.8s)]
*  commitment to never build a nuclear weapon. And everybody's like, how can you take a run at their [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1785.52s)]
*  word? And there's Wichau being like, and I believe them. He literally said. He sounds almost sweet. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1790.24s)]
*  He's like, they told me this and I believe them. What are you going to do? And so I don't know, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1795.92s)]
*  it drives me fucking nuts. That's first thing. Second thing is Wichau has been all over the [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1801.36s)]
*  map because he doesn't know anything about this. Like Ernie Moniz was the secretary of energy [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1807.6s)]
*  for the Obama administration, was in the nuclear talks. He's a fucking nuclear physicist. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1811.28s)]
*  So he could like literally sit down and like understand exactly what he was talking about, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1815.04s)]
*  these incredibly detailed things. And we've talked about the Wichau rolls up at these talks with like [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1818.8s)]
*  one guy with him and now he's got Michael Anton, this kind of like right-wing intellectual, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1822.8799999999999s)]
*  yeah, running the technical talks. Like I didn't run the fucking technical talks in the Iran nuclear [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1829.04s)]
*  deal. So there's just clearly nobody on the US side who understands this technology. And the [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1832.8s)]
*  Iranians like have a bunch of smart guys who work on nuclear programs who are like showing up to like [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1837.84s)]
*  design. Because this is what I remember at the Iran nuclear negotiations. We were literally [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1842.8s)]
*  designing a nuclear program that we could live with, right? Like what constraints, what could they [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1847.12s)]
*  do, what couldn't they do? These guys are just, they want a deal. So they'd probably be happy with [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1851.52s)]
*  the JCPOA. Like Wichau and Trump would be happy if they like enriched only at a very low percent, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1857.9199999999998s)]
*  shipped everything out of the fucking country, had this kind of symbolic enrichment capability [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1864.08s)]
*  that is only useful for like medical isotopes or something like a totally anodyne. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1869.28s)]
*  And they can just say they're done with this. And whether it's five years, 10 years, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1873.84s)]
*  JCPOA's toughest restrictions were 10 years, maybe look at 11 years. And they can say it was [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1878.08s)]
*  tougher than Obama. That should be good enough for them. But they're in this bind because all [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1882.0s)]
*  these people- All their dumb politics. All their dumb politics. Like, well, we got to say no [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1886.3999999999999s)]
*  enrichment. I just don't think the Iranians would accept that. They've invested too much in this [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1890.16s)]
*  program. There's pride involved in it. There's a bit of a hedge involved in it because they've [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1894.16s)]
*  seen the US pull out of these deals in the past. So they don't want to dismantle their whole program. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1898.64s)]
*  And that said, there are other countries that don't have nuclear weapons that have, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1903.0400000000002s)]
*  they keep repeating a talking point that's not true. And now granted it's countries like the [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1907.5200000000002s)]
*  Netherlands and stuff, but it's just not true that no country with a domestic enrichment capability, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1911.92s)]
*  it also doesn't have a nuclear weapon. That's a big Rubio talking point. He says it all the time. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1917.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And JD Vance says it too. And it's just, it's not true. Now the reason Iran is an outlier is [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1920.64s)]
*  because they cheated on the nuclear proliferation treaty. They built these enrichment facilities in [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1927.76s)]
*  secret, which was pretty suspicious, right? So I don't know. I think there's a deal on the table [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1932.48s)]
*  for the Trump administration if they're willing to live with some modest Iranian enrichment [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1938.4s)]
*  capability. There's probably a deal that they can say is in some way tougher than JCPOA, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1944.32s)]
*  even though it wouldn't really be any different. And frankly, it's just whether or not they're [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1950.16s)]
*  going to face down their politics with Netanyahu and some right-wingers in Congress. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1956.16s)]
*  Yeah. You could tell they want a deal. They just want to get something done. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1961.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, and they just want to get it off the table. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1964.3200000000002s)]
*  Understandably. Rightly so. I get it. All right. We're going to take a quick break, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=1966.3200000000002s)]

*  In the average American's closet, 82% of our clothes haven't been worn in the last 12 months. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2107.2000000000003s)]
*  Oh God, is that a real stat? Same. Big time. That is a real stat. In the 1960s, Americans bought an [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2112.0s)]
*  average of 25 items annually. Today, that number has surged to 67. Not for long with these tariffs. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2117.1200000000003s)]
*  Heading back to 25. Clothing purchases have increased 2.5-fold, yet we keep them for only [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2123.44s)]
*  half as long. The American Giant's philosophy is that more isn't necessarily better. They make [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2130.56s)]
*  durable, long-lasting clothes and they do it responsibly. I have a bunch of American Giant [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2135.36s)]
*  pieces. I have a really comfortable, big, cozy sweatshirt. I also have some good sweatpants. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2139.6s)]
*  Sweatshirts are good. Sweatpants really matter. When you have kids, they got to be durable [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2146.96s)]
*  because you're going to wash them a lot and they're going to pull at them and tear at them [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2150.96s)]
*  and you need something quality. The mega corporations obsessed with growth are churning [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2155.36s)]
*  out cheap stuff that leaves us all feeling empty. The founders of American Giant were [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2159.52s)]
*  dissatisfied with how clothes are made and saw this as an opportunity to make things better. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2162.8s)]
*  When you buy from American Giant, you're supporting hardworking people, local communities, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2166.64s)]
*  and quality clothes. American Giant believes in a new kind of conscious buying because small [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2170.48s)]
*  changes can add up to something big. It all started with the greatest hoodie ever made and [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2174.64s)]
*  now expanded to jeans, t-shirts, and more. Get 20% off your first order when you use the promo [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2178.08s)]

*  All right, so listeners of this show know that we've been eagerly watching Trump's [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2191.36s)]
*  flailing tariff announcements and seeming effort to tank the global economy over the last few weeks. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2194.7999999999997s)]
*  There was a big development over the weekend then during talks between the US and China in Geneva, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2200.24s)]
*  Switzerland, where both sides agreed to a drastic reduction in tariffs for about 90 days. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2204.7999999999997s)]
*  So the US tariffs on Chinese stuff will go from 145% to 30%. Chinese tariffs on US stuff will go [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2209.7599999999998s)]
*  from 125% to 10%. According to a bunch of news reports, pressure from industry groups, especially [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2216.56s)]
*  automakers in the defense industry, got Trump to cave. I think in particular, they put a freeze on [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2223.3599999999997s)]
*  the export of rare earth magnets, which are critical for both the technologies and cars [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2229.12s)]
*  and weapons and all sorts of things. According to the Financial Times, Treasury Secretary Scott [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2233.84s)]
*  Besant also had a secret meeting with the Chinese counterpart about three weeks ago. So I would [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2239.04s)]
*  imagine that plowed the fields that were announced this weekend. So Ben, I guess in 90 days, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2243.1200000000003s)]
*  Trump could decide to rev things back up and we could be back in a tariff war. But it just seems [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2251.76s)]
*  like there's just no doubt that he fully capitulated here. The Chinese conceded literally nothing. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2255.6000000000004s)]
*  Nothing, nothing. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2261.1200000000003s)]
*  For retaliatory tariffs. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2261.76s)]
*  Absolutely nothing. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2262.8s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal editorial page wrote the following sentence, [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2263.44s)]
*  rarely has an economic policy been repudiated as soundly and as quickly. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2266.2400000000002s)]
*  Anything jump out of your head this is a mess? [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2270.56s)]
*  Well, it's very Trump-like in the sense that he got absolutely nothing and they said it was like [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2273.2000000000003s)]
*  a deal. It's not a deal, first of all. I mean, there's no substantive change beyond the kind [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2279.36s)]
*  of fluctuation of these tariff rates. The Chinese, as we talked about, were just better positioned [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2286.64s)]
*  to win a trade war. They had a monopoly on these rare earth materials. They can absorb more pain. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2292.16s)]
*  They've invested for the last decade in clean energy and technologies. They have more geopolitical [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2297.92s)]
*  support in lots of the world, particularly given what Trump is doing. So they had a better hand, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2304.24s)]
*  even if they have some economic weaknesses. If you look at Trump though, first of all, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2310.24s)]
*  the insanity of this is there's still 30% tariffs. So it's not like it's all the way wound back. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2315.12s)]
*  It's just not as insane as it was post-liberation day week when he was just [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2321.04s)]
*  like tariffing on everything too social. So there's still going to be economic impacts [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2326.4s)]
*  that are negative. There's still going to be price increases. There's still going to be disruptions. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2331.44s)]
*  And the trust of the rest of the world is already broken because they just don't [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2335.2000000000003s)]
*  believe that Trump is a predictable actor. And I have to say, I don't believe... I think Trump, [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2339.84s)]
*  Scott Besson is useful to talk to markets. He's literally there to speak to markets. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2345.52s)]
*  Yeah, just to whisper in a Jamie Dimon's ear. Yeah, he's just whispering in Jamie [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2350.56s)]
*  Dimon's ear. But I actually don't think he's the real decision maker here. It's Trump and some of [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2353.6s)]
*  the yahoos around him. And so I think at a certain point, he'll probably dial these things back up [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2358.88s)]
*  again, dial them back down. He likes to control the volabili... He's like a child with a toy. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2363.28s)]
*  He likes to be the one who controls volatility in the markets. So he's decided after the [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2369.04s)]
*  post-deliberation day fiasco to dial things back. He'll dial it up at some point. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2374.24s)]
*  Do I think he's going to structurally arrange some deal that's going to remake US-China trade [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2379.8399999999997s)]
*  relations? Absolutely not. And that's what was proved to be completely bullshit. The idea that [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2384.9599999999996s)]
*  this is going to compel China to make all these... Remember Fentanyl? Where's Fentanyl in this thing? [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2390.3999999999996s)]
*  None of the things he talked about are in this at all. No, and apparently the Biden people [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2396.4799999999996s)]
*  actually had cut a pretty impactful counter-Fentanyl deal with the Chinese right at the end of the [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2399.52s)]
*  administration. It's like the Chinese are like, what? Why are you ignoring that? We actually did [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2403.52s)]
*  something on this. I mean, yeah, I agree with you. I think Trump clearly views tariffs as like [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2407.6s)]
*  his first, second, and third favorite tool in his toolkit for every situation. So I assume they'll [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2414.16s)]
*  slap tariffs back on all kinds of countries. I do think that everyone is wondering, do markets [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2419.84s)]
*  matter? Do headlines matter? And the answer is yes. He did not like the stock market crashing. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2425.6s)]
*  He did not like every CEO calling him telling me, you're going to kill my business. I think it [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2430.08s)]
*  really did matter. And so he blinked. And even like I think Republican members of Congress, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2434.4s)]
*  I'm sure calling him being like, I'm not going to be able... I'm going to vote against this. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2438.88s)]
*  It is worth putting a point on the fact that this was one of the most catastrophic announcements [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2444.0s)]
*  early in the presidency ever. He rolls at Liberation Day and all the big charts and everything. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2449.7599999999998s)]
*  And just look at the climb down and there are no deals. Even this UK trade deal. I couldn't [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2456.16s)]
*  describe to you what that trade deal is. It's so meager. It's the kind of thing that would [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2461.12s)]
*  normally be announced by the deputy US trade representative in an article that only appears [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2467.52s)]
*  in a three paragraph notice in Bloomberg News. And they're trying to treat it like it's some [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2474.08s)]
*  huge trade deal. Yeah, they're trying to amp it up. They did like a stupid phone call with Keir [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2478.32s)]
*  Starmer. They did it on the day there was a new pope announced. Sorry pal, I don't think [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2482.24s)]
*  this is going to lead to headlines. One thing that was a big deal was the ceasefire between [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2486.3999999999996s)]
*  India and Pakistan, Ben. Good transition. Thank you. Last week, the tensions between [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2490.3999999999996s)]
*  India and Pakistan, it was like just short of open warfare between these two nuclear armed [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2495.52s)]
*  militaries. Folks probably remember that the conflict started when terrorists killed 26 people, [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2500.72s)]
*  mostly Hindu tourists from India in India controlled Kashmir. India vowed to retaliate [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2505.6s)]
*  against these terrorist groups that are based in Pakistan and against parts of the Pakistani [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2511.12s)]
*  security state that support these groups. The fighting escalated fast. It included airstrikes [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2514.88s)]
*  deep into Pakistan. The Pakistani military said they shot down at least one Indian jet. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2520.88s)]
*  There were Air Force dogfights. The Pakistanis launched this volley of like several hundred [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2526.56s)]
*  drones across the border. So it got really scary. And for a while, the Trump administration was just [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2532.3199999999997s)]
*  completely checked out. They were making comments like these from President Trump and JD Vance. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2538.08s)]
*  Now, it's a shame we just heard about it. Just as we were walking in the doors of the oval, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2544.0s)]
*  they've been fighting for a long time. You know, they've been fighting for [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2548.24s)]
*  many, many decades and centuries, actually, if you really think about it. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2551.92s)]
*  Now, I just hope it ends very quickly. What we can do is try to encourage these folks to deescalate [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2557.52s)]
*  a little bit, but we're not going to get involved in the middle of war. That's fundamentally none of [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2562.72s)]
*  our business. So according to a bunch of media reports, this became our business, Mr. JD Vance, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2566.8s)]
*  after the administration learned that India bombed an area near the headquarters of Pakistan's [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2573.1200000000003s)]
*  Strategic Plans Division, which oversees their nuclear arsenal. The New York Times [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2577.76s)]
*  estimates they have about 170 nuclear warheads sitting in Pakistan somewhere. That's a big deal [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2582.2400000000002s)]
*  because if Pakistan thought that airstrike was intended to take out their nuclear command and [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2587.2000000000003s)]
*  control capability, that could lead to them doing something really fucking scary. The Times pointed [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2593.44s)]
*  out that there were reports in Pakistani media that Prime Minister Sharif had called a meeting [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2598.16s)]
*  of the National Command Authority, which is the group in Pakistan that makes decisions about the [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2602.48s)]
*  use of nuclear weapons. Pretty terrifying. Either way, Trump's team, they got into gear. Vance called [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2606.7200000000003s)]
*  Prime Minister Modi in India. He warned about escalation risk. Rubio called his Pakistani [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2612.88s)]
*  counterparts. Trump called nobody. But he did front run both parties and announced the ceasefire [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2616.7200000000003s)]
*  deal on truth social, which the Indians then initially denied. So it was a mess, but good [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2622.8s)]
*  outcome, at least for now. Ben, what did you make of how all this went down? And do you think there's [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2629.52s)]
*  any hope that Mr. Big Boy, Smarty Pants JD Vance might learn that actually diplomatic intervention [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2634.96s)]
*  to prevent wars is a good thing? First of all, this was pretty scary because in the past, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2641.1200000000003s)]
*  they've lobbed missiles at each other. Sometimes they've literally just bombed dirt and said that [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2647.6000000000004s)]
*  they hit something that they didn't. But they were hitting military targets. This was starting to [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2656.88s)]
*  feel like it could become an actual all out war, not just like skirmishes on the line of control [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2661.1200000000003s)]
*  with episodic strikes. And so that's scary. And that, by the way, is still something that happened [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2666.2400000000002s)]
*  and that could flare up again if there is another incident. I have to say, and look, this is not us [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2673.6s)]
*  just kind of hating on the Trump administration. You heard us give credit in this podcast on Syria. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2680.32s)]
*  The way they handled this was fucking atrocious because they did not negotiate the ceasefire. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2686.2400000000002s)]
*  I just like they lobbed in the calls that anybody would lob in, like any US administration. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2690.88s)]
*  Bare minimum. Why would you not make those calls? What else are you doing? You're the Secretary of [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2695.2s)]
*  State. It's your job. I know you've got to take a break from being the archivist and whatever the [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2699.36s)]
*  hell he is. There's a lot of filing. National security advisor. But sure, he's lobbing in calls. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2705.2000000000003s)]
*  And then JD Vance, who has this kind of intellectual isolationist worldview, which makes no sense in an [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2709.28s)]
*  actual world where if there's a nuclear exchange in India and Pakistan, the fucking global economy [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2714.96s)]
*  collapses and there's tens of millions of refugees and maybe a nuclear winter over big chunks of the [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2719.6s)]
*  world. So yeah, it matters to us. And so then these guys, they lob in the pretty routine calls. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2724.64s)]
*  Trump doesn't even call. And then they get wind of the fact that the Indians and Pakistanis [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2730.72s)]
*  themselves are probably like, oh shit, we're getting pretty close to the edge here. Let's have a [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2735.68s)]
*  ceasefire. They announced this on Truth Social, clearly without clearing it with it. Because if [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2739.3599999999997s)]
*  it was a US broker at ceasefire, we all know what that looks like. Their joint statements all go [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2745.7599999999998s)]
*  out simultaneously from the US and India and Pakistan. There's a plan. Instead, he fucking [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2750.64s)]
*  truths it. And the Indians are like, what the fuck is this? The Indians insist, by the way, that [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2756.24s)]
*  their challenges with Pakistan are a bilateral issue and it's nobody else's business. So Trump [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2761.68s)]
*  announcing that he broke her to ceasefire really pissed them off. And so why does that matter? [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2766.48s)]
*  I think it matters because if there's a next time, they're kind of not going to want to [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2772.24s)]
*  hear from us because they don't trust us. These things, everything is so short term and transactional [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2776.4s)]
*  Trump and how can I get attention? So look, it's not a good outcome. It was a bad outcome for a [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2781.28s)]
*  few days there. It was scary. Like actual people died in these exchanges of fire. It was a bigger [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2787.2000000000003s)]
*  conflict than they've had in recent years. And am I glad the US got involved? Sure. But so were a [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2794.2400000000002s)]
*  bunch of countries, by the way. The Qataris were involved as they normally are. The Turks were [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2799.6000000000004s)]
*  involved. Other countries, the Brits were blubbing in calls. And I just think it's not a good look [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2804.48s)]
*  for them to treat everything, including the potential war between India and Pakistan, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2810.32s)]
*  as just some vehicle for Trump to truth something. Because that, again, people aren't going to want [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2815.12s)]
*  to let us into their business if that's how he's going to go about things. Did you catch any of the [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2820.32s)]
*  clips from various Indian TV stations about the conflict that were going around on social media? [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2824.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Really wild stuff. Indian TV is pretty wild. Man, the amount of like, [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2831.28s)]
*  the nationalism is getting stoked from just every single corner in both of these countries now. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2837.84s)]
*  It comes from Modi directly, but it comes from every TV network. There was one clip that was [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2843.36s)]
*  going around, it was just like the sound when there's like an inter... If a nuclear strike was [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2847.84s)]
*  coming, like the kind of siren you would hear was just running in the background of the entire clip. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2855.2000000000003s)]
*  It's like very... It's like incitement. Yeah. And look, I get that there's a lot of [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2859.04s)]
*  hate. Thousands of years of hate. Yeah, millions of years. But the dehumanization [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2867.44s)]
*  in both directions is dangerous because that's how you end up just killing lots of people. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2876.2400000000002s)]
*  If you consume Indian television and Pakistani television, you're kind of conditioned to see [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2881.44s)]
*  these people as like subhuman enemies. I'm not absolving ourselves from this. The right-wing [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2886.4s)]
*  media treats a lot of people in this country as subhuman too. But I just think that that is a [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2893.28s)]
*  dangerous dynamic to just continue. Big time. No, I saw an Indian reporter bragging about how he had [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2898.1600000000003s)]
*  not interviewed any Pakistanis the duration of the conflict. That's a great way to understand [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2902.32s)]
*  what the fuck is going on. What does that do for anyone? Yeah, bad. One war that President Trump [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2906.1600000000003s)]
*  has not ended is the war in Ukraine, Ben. So that said, the Russians and the Ukrainians are [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2910.8s)]
*  maybe going to have their first direct talks since the start of the war, this Thursday in [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2915.92s)]
*  Istanbul. What happened here is the Russians proposed having talks in response to demands that [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2920.2400000000002s)]
*  they implement a 30-day ceasefire. This is their way of kind of evading that request. But you were [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2927.44s)]
*  hearing this from Kiev, from Trump, from Europe, lots of places. On Sunday, Trump decided to [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2931.76s)]
*  endorse this idea, a true thing, quote, Ukraine should agree to this immediately. At least they [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2937.28s)]
*  will be able to determine whether or not a deal is possible. And if it is not, European leaders [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2942.0s)]
*  and the US will know where everything stands and can proceed accordingly. Have the meeting now, [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2946.16s)]
*  all caps, three exclamation points. It's not clear if Zelensky is going to show up in Turkey [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2950.4s)]
*  regardless, or if he's only going to go if Putin goes. But Zelensky also was like, I'll go. Also, [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2956.24s)]
*  Trump, you should go. He's trying to make this a big thing. The Russians have been coy about what [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2962.16s)]
*  Putin is going to do. Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesman, said, quote, as soon as the president [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2966.8s)]
*  considers it necessary, he will announce it. But ever mindful of the moments where he could get [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2971.12s)]
*  big ratings, Trump said, I'll join. I'll fly to Istanbul, I guess, already over the Atlantic. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2975.52s)]
*  So Ben, I guess I would argue there are two theories I've seen. One is, by endorsing the talks, [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2981.3599999999997s)]
*  Trump undercut his own demand for a ceasefire. I get that. On the other hand, talking seems [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2987.6s)]
*  potentially positive. In a less positive category, though, NBC News reported that Steve Wicoff, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2993.6s)]
*  the envoy for everything, relied on a Kremlin translator in his three conversations with Putin [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=2998.64s)]
*  on previous episodes. We've talked about Wicoff, Rodogsies meetings without experts. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3004.8799999999997s)]
*  But not having your own translator is insane. What are the odds that this translator is [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3010.08s)]
*  intelligence operative? 98%, 99%? 150%. First of all, just side note, big week for Turkey here. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3017.52s)]
*  Erdogan, right? Because obviously, they are huge supporters of Al-Shara in Syria, [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3027.12s)]
*  and have been advocating lifting sanctions. They're somehow hosting these meetings, [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3031.6s)]
*  like the PKK's disbanding. So Erdogan, beside from being a total autocratic creep who locked up his [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3035.36s)]
*  biggest opponent, his foreign policy, he's having a pretty weak. Look, this does feel like Trump, [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3043.36s)]
*  I am on the side of people that feel like this was a bit of a rug pull on Zelensky, because [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3051.12s)]
*  he had Keir Starmer, Mertz, the new German Chancellor, Macron, and I think Donald Tusk [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3057.12s)]
*  from Poland in Kiev for like show solidarity. And it felt like Trump didn't like the fact that the [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3065.36s)]
*  attention was no longer on him. So he's like, demanding this meeting happen. And I think [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3072.56s)]
*  Zelensky then kind of called the bluff and was like, okay, fine, I'll show up. But like, [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3076.96s)]
*  Zelensky is so fucking sick of the goalposts moving on him. And so he's like, fine, I'll go [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3081.6s)]
*  to Turkey, because I didn't think Putin would go. And so we'll see what happens now. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3086.56s)]
*  Did you see the literal Russian disinformation going all over social media, especially on Twitter, [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3091.2799999999997s)]
*  where people were trying to claim that Mertz had cut up a line of cocaine and had it on the table [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3096.0s)]
*  in the train on the way to Kiev? And there's clearly a napkin on the table and a piece of [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3101.12s)]
*  string that's attached to a folder. So Mertz covers up the string, because he's just reaching [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3105.92s)]
*  for his file folder. And then Macron grabs a napkin that he'd like balled up and he hides [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3110.96s)]
*  and people like, oh, that was the bag. Can you imagine two people less likely to be doing lines [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3115.68s)]
*  on a train than Keir Starmer and Friedrich Mertz? Macron, I bet he gets down. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3122.08s)]
*  Let's just take a minute and imagine if that did happen. How fucking awesome it would be if [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3127.44s)]
*  like, you know, Mertz, Friedrich Mertz's new chancellor is just like ripping lines. And then [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3133.36s)]
*  Macron comes in and he's like, hey, can I get a bump? You know, like, who starts that conversation? [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3138.64s)]
*  Anyone got a bag? What are we doing? There's so many people who are sharing it. Anyway, [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3144.0s)]
*  I'm glad that happened because, you know, that's why the internet is still a decent place sometimes. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3150.96s)]
*  I just think that like Trump is, he's literally like a machine gun dropped on the floor with these [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3158.48s)]
*  negotiations, right? He'll be fixated on something. Remember the ceasefire? Remember the 30-day [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3164.48s)]
*  ceasefire? And each time Ukraine is the one that accepts it, right? So Ukraine accepted the ceasefire, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3168.96s)]
*  Putin wouldn't. Each time he throws these things out, and it's always Ukrainians who he acts like [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3173.68s)]
*  are intransigent, who are the ones who are like, fine, we'll do it. And Russia, Putin never fucking [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3178.64s)]
*  does it, ever, right? And meanwhile, they're still like grinding away Ukraine. So I don't know what [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3183.52s)]
*  it's going to take for, I mean, I don't think Trump cares, but I do think that the good thing [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3189.2s)]
*  that you're seeing is that like, you know, Zelensky's kind of got this clique of Europeans [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3194.0s)]
*  who have his back, who are from like pretty big countries with some real militaries, although not [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3198.96s)]
*  nearly as real as the United States. I mean, that's the best card he has to play is to hold [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3204.24s)]
*  those Europeans together behind him and just trying to stay like, if not ahead of Trump, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3208.32s)]
*  like only a half step behind him until it becomes more and more apparent that like, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3212.88s)]
*  Putin is just not the one who's serious about ending this war. Yeah. And you know, if you get [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3217.84s)]
*  down, you guys get a little bump from your. Yeah, it's all some good time. I was reading [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3221.44s)]
*  this incredible story in the Wall Street Journal about how there's such an excess of cocaine that [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3227.12s)]
*  the cartels are even better funded. So you know how they the cartels have those kind of like [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3231.76s)]
*  DIY submarines they take from, you know, kind of Columbia up around to somewhere else in Central [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3237.28s)]
*  America. They're not fully submerged. They're like mostly submerged in like with like a little, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3243.52s)]
*  you know, they're kind of at the water line. But now they're taking these, these submarines [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3247.92s)]
*  all the way to Europe. They're like, they're like driving them to like Spain. It's crazy. It takes [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3251.84s)]
*  like 30 days. It's a wild story. Great story in the journal. Anyway, you know, good day, good, [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3256.56s)]
*  good time to be into Coke, I guess. Two more, two more big stories. Unless you live under a rock, [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3261.52s)]
*  which case credit to you. Thanks for listening. You probably heard that they selected a new pope [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3269.6000000000004s)]
*  last week, Ben, you and I talked through the favorites to become the new pope, according to [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3274.3199999999997s)]
*  the betting odds and boy was that was not our man on the card. Cardinal Robert Francis prevost now [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3279.2799999999997s)]
*  Pope Leo the 14th had something like 0.3% odds according to Polymarket. It's almost like the [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3285.2799999999997s)]
*  Mavericks getting the number one pick in the lottery. Yeah. How'd that happen? You think [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3290.0s)]
*  it's rigged? I think it's rigged. Because of the lucatrade. Yeah, I get it. That later. Pope Leo, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3293.8399999999997s)]
*  as he's called now is from Chicago. According to the New York Times, Pope Leo is Creole roots from [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3298.08s)]
*  New Orleans. I think his grandfather was from Haiti. Super interesting guy. He spent two decades [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3302.64s)]
*  working in Peru as a missionary, a parish priest, and eventually as bishop. Then Pope Francis named [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3307.2799999999997s)]
*  him to this powerful Vatican position overseeing the appointment of bishops around the world. But [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3312.24s)]
*  Ben, do you know who did predict this? My boy, Steve Bannon. Listen to this. They're gonna say [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3317.2799999999997s)]
*  Stephen A Smith. No, did he predict it? No, no, he did. This is Bannon from about a week ago. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3323.52s)]
*  I do think one of the dark horses, I think, unfortunately, is one of the most progressive [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3328.48s)]
*  is Cardinal Prevost. I don't think he's getting enough play. He's certainly on the short list. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3332.64s)]
*  That's my boy, Steve. It's funny that he sounds like he's betting on it, like on Fandl. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3336.88s)]
*  He's not getting enough play. He's not getting enough love. Not enough action on Prevost. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3340.8s)]
*  So Bannon aside, what do you think it means just for the US? We got an American pope. Yeah, [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3344.2400000000002s)]
*  look, there've been a zillion takes, a zillion Chicago memes. But look, to take a serious note, [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3350.2400000000002s)]
*  what's interesting about the United States, and I always try to say this to some of my friends [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3358.2400000000002s)]
*  overseas who, it's easy to look at the United States and just see Trump or just see our [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3361.44s)]
*  shitty, stupid-ass foreign policy over the years or just see some soulless capitalism. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3368.08s)]
*  It's a reminder that this is a big, diverse country with many different people. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3374.88s)]
*  I like the fact that Pope Leo is going to be the most prominent American in the world. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3379.12s)]
*  I guess together with Trump, but he'll, God willing, be there after Trump. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3386.4s)]
*  And that's a totally different kind of America. That's a guy from humble background, [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3391.6s)]
*  a guy who made his life about missionary work in Latin America, a guy who speaks four or five [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3396.0s)]
*  languages, a guy who cares about social justice. White Sox fan? Yeah, white Sox fan, like underdogs. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3402.7200000000003s)]
*  Knicks fan? Apparently he was tweeting about the Knicks or something. I mean, it's a Nova Knicks [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3409.6s)]
*  guy. I mean, for those not in the know in the world though community here, we've got [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3414.08s)]
*  Jalen Brunson, Mikkel Bridges, and Josh Hart, three Villanova alums, former national champions, [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3417.92s)]
*  and we know it's been confirmed that the Pope is aware of the Nova Knicks at least, right? [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3424.56s)]
*  Because he's a private Villanova grad. It was weird that he went to an American college. I [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3429.44s)]
*  made this point to love it. It's probably inappropriate, but there's definitely some [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3432.96s)]
*  seven-year-old lady who went to Villanova who was like, oh my God, I banged the Pope. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3436.48s)]
*  Right? No. What do you mean? This was before he became a priest. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3440.88s)]
*  Oh, he wasn't celibate? I don't know. I haven't asked him. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3444.96s)]
*  Could be a seven-year-old dude talking about it in the group chat. I don't know. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3452.6400000000003s)]
*  Well, that would make for a good story. It's a good sitcom. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3455.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great sitcom actually. Like the Pope before celibacy. But anyway, put that aside. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3461.84s)]
*  I like that this guy's giving me a different face to the world for the United States. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3468.0s)]
*  It also seems like he's very much cut from the Francis cloth. He's a progressive. He cares about [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3471.44s)]
*  that part of Catholicism that is actually about what Jesus talked about, like helping the poor [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3476.64s)]
*  and social justice. It's a good part. It's kind of interesting to me that at a time in which the [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3481.52s)]
*  world is swinging pretty far right in its politics in a lot of places, like the Catholic Church is [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3485.6s)]
*  becoming this more progressive institution. Swing left. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3490.48s)]
*  I'll take it. Yeah, I'll take it. Better news than just the Chicago piece of this, [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3493.12s)]
*  you know, I'm happy for Mike O'Neill, our friend. But it's also just like a reminder that the United [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3497.12s)]
*  States is big and complicated. And it's the country that could produce Trump and it's a country that [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3505.04s)]
*  could produce this guy. And I hope that people bear that in mind as he's spreading this message [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3510.56s)]
*  of a more kind of progressive view of social justice. Yeah, I don't really think about the [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3516.48s)]
*  Pope often, but you know, Pope Francis and now Leo the 14th, you know, something to be excited [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3522.72s)]
*  about. Yeah. And I hope he's, you know, like I know, like they're sometimes reticent, but I mean, [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3527.3599999999997s)]
*  there's a lot of shit going on that we, you know, the Pope wants to speak out all the better. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3531.9199999999996s)]
*  Stay active. Stay active on Gaza. He continues. Yeah. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3535.8399999999997s)]
*  Pope Francis on Gaza. Steve Bannon later said, quote, [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3538.48s)]
*  the conclave that elected Pope Leo was more rigged against then against Donald Trump than the 2020 [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3541.68s)]
*  presidential election. Is that a real quote? Yeah. Pope Leo's brother also says he served on the same [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3546.3999999999996s)]
*  Navy ship as Steve Bannon, like back in the eighties. Isn't that crazy? What a coincidence. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3552.24s)]
*  Well, that, I mean, we could make a whole series. We'd start with the Villanova, you know, party [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3556.56s)]
*  scene and onto the Bannon ship. That's a, we'll talk about it. We'll talk about that. The brother [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3561.2799999999997s)]
*  did seem to really like his 15 minutes. Yeah, I know he's out there. You're having a good time. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3566.08s)]
*  I forgot to ask Chris Murphy about this, but apparently Pope Leo retweeted Chris Murphy in [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3569.9199999999996s)]
*  2017 as a tweet about the Las Vegas shooting. I mean, Murph is going to heaven now. I mean, [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3575.2s)]
*  if the Pope retweets you, I think that's a, your ticket's punched. And the last Pope Leo, [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3580.4s)]
*  it was during the industrial revolution in the late 1800s. And he was known as the Pope of the [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3584.4s)]
*  workers. I did like what the Pope said about, he chose Leo because the last Pope was a time of [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3588.8s)]
*  rampant capitalism and inequality. And now, you know, that, like, so he's, you know, he's thinking [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3594.8s)]
*  about the right things. Taking on economic issues, social justice. We like him. A good, good working [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3599.92s)]
*  class. You know, like he's going to stop giving tax breaks to the companies that ship jobs overseas. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3603.84s)]
*  You know, deep cut. Okay. Final story for us. So as listeners know, there's been a horrible [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3608.08s)]
*  sea change in immigration policy under Trump. We recently learned today or yesterday that the [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3613.68s)]
*  Department of Homeland Security is terminating temporary protected status for people here from [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3618.4s)]
*  Afghanistan. That means 9,000 Afghans could be deported back to the Taliban regime. These are [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3622.7999999999997s)]
*  presumably people that helped the United States military during the two decades of war there. So [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3629.36s)]
*  this is truly disgraceful. There was a report the administration was planning to send migrants [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3634.2400000000002s)]
*  to Libya. Hard to imagine a less safe place. Luckily, a judge blocked that plan. But the [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3639.52s)]
*  administration is having talks with officials in Rwanda about sending migrants from the US there. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3645.44s)]
*  Thank you, Boris Johnson and the Tory party in the UK for that terrible idea. At the same time, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3649.84s)]
*  the US though, is welcoming, quote unquote, refugees from South Africa, as long as they're [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3655.28s)]
*  white. Here's Trump talking about what's happening in South Africa and why he's welcoming these folks [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3661.44s)]
*  here from earlier this week. But it's a genocide that's taking place that you people don't want [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3667.2000000000003s)]
*  to write about. But it's a terrible thing that's taking place. And farmers are being killed. They [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3671.84s)]
*  happen to be white. But whether they're white or black makes no difference to me. But white farmers [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3679.76s)]
*  are being brutally killed and their land is being confiscated in South Africa. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3686.0s)]
*  To be clear, there is not a genocide against white farmers in South Africa. South Africa is a very, [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3691.44s)]
*  very violent country. Many farmers live in the middle of nowhere. They're at risk from violence [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3696.32s)]
*  because the cops can't get to them easily if you live in the rural farm. But there's no data or [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3701.04s)]
*  evidence to suggest that this is a systematic racial thing, let alone a genocide. Also, [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3704.64s)]
*  white South Africans are far better off financially than black South Africans. White people are about [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3709.6s)]
*  7% of the population, but they own between two-thirds and three-quarters of the land in [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3713.68s)]
*  South Africa. They are exponentially wealthier on average than black South Africans. We should also [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3718.3999999999996s)]
*  just be honest. We're talking about the descendants of colonial settlers that set up the apartheid [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3724.7999999999997s)]
*  system and government actions that are now trying to create a bit of equality for black people who [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3729.8399999999997s)]
*  are just brutally oppressed. I'm not suggesting that means these white farmers should be subjected [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3737.12s)]
*  to violence or any kind of harm, but the fact that they're getting special treatment by the US [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3741.76s)]
*  as refugees, given the history, is pretty disgraceful. Ben, I remember you and I talked [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3747.36s)]
*  about this in 2018 because Trump started tweeting about it. He saw a segment on Tucker Carlson [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3752.88s)]
*  about white genocide against South African farmers. He demanded Mike Pompeo do an investigation that [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3760.48s)]
*  resulted in nothing because there was nothing to do or investigate. But I don't know. I've just [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3765.6800000000003s)]
*  been thinking about what an immigration policy that is this overtly racist, that message that [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3770.96s)]
*  sends to the world. Yeah, this is a really important story, and I'm glad it got a lot of [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3778.32s)]
*  attention. I hope it continues to get attention because it kind of gives away the whole game. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3782.96s)]
*  First of all, on its face, their argument for air lifting these white farmers from South Africa, [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3787.2s)]
*  their argument is an argument for why there should actually be a refugee program. In other words, [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3796.48s)]
*  if Trump is legitimately concerned about people facing threats of violence and political persecution, [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3801.6s)]
*  there are about nine million communities around the world that you would put ahead of these white [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3806.64s)]
*  South Africans. By the way, at the top of that list would be Afghans who, if they get sent back [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3811.2s)]
*  to Afghanistan, could be disappeared by the fucking Taliban. The first thing is, it's completely [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3815.68s)]
*  absurd on its face. If you actually cared about what Trump said, going down the list, people from [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3822.56s)]
*  Sudan, people from Afghanistan, people from unfortunately a lot of Myanmar, all manner of [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3829.36s)]
*  places. It also bears saying that the Afghans who came in under TPS, like some of the other [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3837.6s)]
*  people that had TPS revoked, did not come in illegally. They were following what they thought [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3843.12s)]
*  were the rules under their temporary protection status. All that said, I think what's important [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3848.4s)]
*  here is it gives away the game because it does reveal the fundamental white supremacy that is [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3852.96s)]
*  embedded in the Trump project. I know it's not post George Floyd anymore, but how else do you [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3858.7200000000003s)]
*  explain a situation in which they want to send pretty much largely, if not exclusively, black [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3865.52s)]
*  and brown people to places like Libya and Rwanda while welcoming plain loads of white people [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3872.56s)]
*  from South Africa to the United States? This is the Stephen Miller, Tucker Carlson worldview [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3878.08s)]
*  where we're going to reverse, quote unquote, great replacement. We're going to push black and brown [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3883.2s)]
*  people out of this country and we're going to become the safe haven for white people. This airlift [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3888.0s)]
*  of Elon Musk's from Africa is absolutely ridiculous. It cuts a grunt. Decades, maybe you think, [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3893.2799999999997s)]
*  Tommy, our former boss, Barack Obama, his father came to the United States in an airlift of [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3900.24s)]
*  students from Kenya that were coming here to be educated in the United States. That's who we used [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3907.68s)]
*  to be 60, 70 years ago. We've gone way backwards here. I just think this isn't just a weird [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3912.24s)]
*  sideshow. This is pretty elemental to the project here. It's not even a dog whistle. It's a pretty, [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3924.56s)]
*  I don't even know, it's just a cry to his base. Look, we're letting in the white people [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3932.24s)]
*  and we're kicking out the brown people. I don't know, sometimes you got to call out what it is. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3936.16s)]
*  This is a white supremacist immigration policy. Yeah, it's weird. Dog whistle became the thing [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3941.6s)]
*  we would talk about all the time, but you're right, it's not a dog whistle. It's a policy. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3947.3599999999997s)]
*  It's a policy. Welcoming white people, sending black people to countries they were never from. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3951.3599999999997s)]
*  But also the language involved, the term white genocide, far right propaganda. It was popularized [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3957.04s)]
*  by a white separatist literal neo-Nazi. It's been used. It was the Unite the Right rally in [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3964.16s)]
*  Charlottesville in 2017. There were signs about white genocide. The Tree of Life synagogue shooter [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3971.12s)]
*  talked about white genocide or the Great Replacement Theory. It's usually deeply anti-Semitic. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3977.12s)]
*  It's usually the Jews who are conducting the white genocide in these twisted right-wing worldviews. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3982.96s)]
*  These theories, this propaganda has been used to defend violence. The President of the United States [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3989.44s)]
*  saying it, it's like you can't understate what a big deal that is. It does make you wonder [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=3998.0s)]
*  who is in his ear about this. It's got to be Elon. Well, there's a lot of South Africans. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4003.7599999999998s)]
*  David Sachs, Elon, Peter Thiel, there's a whole, the PayPal mafia is all. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4009.44s)]
*  I'm telling you, man, the white South African international is nothing to sneer at. I mean, [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4013.92s)]
*  and they have their, sins of the fathers don't always pass on, but sometimes they do. These are [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4021.52s)]
*  people that came out of apartheid, came out of, they're nostalgic for that. They used to complain [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4028.0s)]
*  about what happened. Yes, are there flaws in land redistribution in Zimbabwe and South Africa? Sure. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4033.92s)]
*  But to your point, Mandela held back the, these people were allowed to keep their farms. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4042.24s)]
*  There's crime, sure, but there's all kinds of crime in South Africa. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4051.04s)]
*  When it comes to the murder rate, the murder rate in South Africa is just shockingly high. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4054.4799999999996s)]
*  And that's a universal problem. Yeah, but it's high for black people too. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4058.4799999999996s)]
*  Exactly. It's a universal problem. I think in terms of land redistribution, I think one of the [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4060.4799999999996s)]
*  things that led to Trump really freaking out about this was a law that was passed that said the [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4065.2s)]
*  government could expropriate land from people without compensation. But we talked about this [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4069.2s)]
*  at Paz de America on Monday. A lot of experts say it was just kind of clarifying rules that were [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4074.56s)]
*  already in place. And when you read deeper into this, most experts say actually the sin is that [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4079.2s)]
*  South Africa has done very little to reduce racial inequality since the end of apartheid. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4086.08s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. In fact, people basically hate the government because it's been corrupt and sclerotic [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4092.24s)]
*  and incapable of delivering on the promises. Yeah, and I'm sorry. These people built their [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4098.32s)]
*  estates on a complete white supremacist system of apartheid. And they've... I don't know. The [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4102.4s)]
*  fact that these are the people that you look at the world and you see these people as the vulnerable [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4111.5199999999995s)]
*  people in the world, given all the places where there are people who are actually vulnerable, [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4115.679999999999s)]
*  and we're sending people back to those places, it's a real stain. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4119.599999999999s)]
*  It's real fucked up. Imagine this happening in 2016, Trump articulating some of these things. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4124.799999999999s)]
*  The reaction would have been... Much bigger. Yeah, that's the thing. The frog has been boiling [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4131.36s)]
*  for a while here. Yeah, and we're just toast. Okay, we're going to take a quick break. When [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4135.04s)]

*  say they have avoided seeking mental health support due to fear of judgment. When people hesitate to [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4260.16s)]
*  get help, it doesn't just affect them. It impacts families, workplaces, and entire communities. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4264.16s)]
*  This mental health awareness month, let's encourage everyone to take care of their wellbeing and break [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4268.5599999999995s)]
*  the stigma. The world is better when people are healthy and happy. You all need therapy. Don't [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4272.96s)]
*  even pretend for a second. You don't need it. We all need it. It's good for you. It'll make you feel [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4277.599999999999s)]

*  crooked world. Senator Chris Murphy, welcome back to the show. Amen. Thanks for having me. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4313.84s)]
*  It's great to see you. So we're talking on Tuesday afternoon as we speak. President Trump is in Saudi [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4317.84s)]
*  Arabia. He'll go on to Qatar, then the United Arab Emirates. A lot about this trip is unusual, [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4321.92s)]
*  but I really want to talk with you about why it presents a truly unprecedented opportunity for [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4327.36s)]
*  political corruption. Just a few examples for listeners to kind of set the table. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4333.36s)]
*  Qatar is apparently giving Trump a 747. There is an Emirati-run investment firm that recently [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4337.76s)]
*  announced they will be buying $2 billion worth of a Trump family cryptocurrency for no discernible [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4343.2s)]
*  business reason. Trump's real estate business is working on a luxury golf course in Qatar, [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4349.52s)]
*  residential towers in Saudi Arabia, a new Trump hotel in Dubai. Jared Kushner has gotten a bunch [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4354.160000000001s)]
*  of money from all of these governments. Senator, it's genuinely hard to just keep track of all of [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4359.040000000001s)]
*  this corruption, let alone make sense of it. But what is your sense of like, what is the other end [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4364.080000000001s)]
*  of the deal? What are these countries getting from Trump in return for these giant favors? [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4369.52s)]
*  Yeah, you're being generous. It's not an opportunity for corruption. It's like [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4374.8s)]
*  corruption right in front of us. Right? Quid pro quos being announced as Trump is touring the [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4378.8s)]
*  Middle East. I mean, first of all, it's just so unbelievably brazen. Trump is going to these three [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4385.2s)]
*  countries, not because they are the three most important countries in the world, not because [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4390.0s)]
*  there are three most important allies, but because they are the three countries that are willing to [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4392.96s)]
*  pay him. These are the countries that are willing to just hand him cash. So he's going to the region [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4396.24s)]
*  to collect. Another example of the brazenness, part of the deal that you just, part of the [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4401.44s)]
*  corruption you just talked about is this UAE investment in a Trump family crypto business. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4407.5199999999995s)]
*  It's a $2 billion investment and the Trump entity is essentially acting as a bank. So [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4415.04s)]
*  it takes the money, it gets to invest that money and it's so much money, $2 billion, that they can [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4423.2s)]
*  make hundreds of millions of dollars a year just on the investments. But the entity is not just the [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4428.96s)]
*  Trump family, it's the Trump family and the Witkoff family. So it's Trump's kids and the son of the [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4433.68s)]
*  Middle East envoy, just to make it perfectly clear that when you're dealing with world liberty [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4441.2s)]
*  financial or whatever the hell it's called, you are definitely dealing directly with the people [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4447.6s)]
*  who make the decisions on US Middle East policy. Okay, so what's on the other end of this? Every [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4451.68s)]
*  single one of these countries needs something and they need something immediate from the United [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4455.92s)]
*  States. The UAE wants the United States to relax our restrictions on semiconductor sales to the [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4460.08s)]
*  UAE and Trump basically announced as soon as the crypto deal was set that he was ready to do that. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4467.68s)]
*  The Saudis want a nuclear deal with the United States that is better than every other country's [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4475.4400000000005s)]
*  nuclear deal. In particular, they want to be able to enrich uranium in Saudi Arabia, which [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4480.72s)]
*  would allow them a pathway to a bomb. Qatar just sort of wants to make sure that they don't get [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4485.6s)]
*  cut out of the deal. What happened during Trump's first term was that the Saudis and the Amirates [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4489.92s)]
*  ganged up on the Qataris and the United States backed the Saudi play. So the Qataris are willing [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4494.4800000000005s)]
*  to give Trump whatever he asks for because they just want to make sure that they still get [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4499.200000000001s)]
*  invited to these clubs. But everybody's got an ask and it seems like Trump is ready to fulfill [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4503.04s)]
*  all of their asks because they are doing what is the price of admission in the Trump administration, [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4509.360000000001s)]
*  which is send Trump and his family boatloads of cash. Yeah, there's grease in them. The [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4513.92s)]
*  corruption in Trump 1.0, as best we could tell, was like governments renting extra room blocks [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4518.72s)]
*  at his hotels for weeks on end or corrupt real estate stuff. Trump 2.0 features this kind of [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4524.88s)]
*  novel crypto currency element or avenue to buy him off. How do you think that changes things? [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4532.08s)]
*  Trump's theory is very different in his second term. He's essentially testing not just the [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4538.08s)]
*  Republican Party, but the public writ large. He's saying, if I engage in daily acts of corruption [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4543.6s)]
*  in the dozens, then is it really corruption? Or if I'm telling you that I'm stealing, [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4551.76s)]
*  will you just consider that it's part of the price of Donald Trump being president? I think for a [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4558.72s)]
*  little while it was working. I think for a little while the American people were like, well, I guess [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4564.400000000001s)]
*  we kind of knew he was corrupt and we elected him and maybe we should look the other way. But as [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4568.72s)]
*  the corruption has gotten bigger, as it's not tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars, [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4572.48s)]
*  but it's now billions of dollars and it's as gaudy as the gift of a gold-plated plane, [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4577.04s)]
*  I think the American people are just sort of saying, okay, enough. And a few Republicans are [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4583.2s)]
*  saying enough. So it's the size of the corruption. It's the fact that it's all playing out in public [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4587.679999999999s)]
*  and it's the very transparent way in which he's operationalizing the entirety of the federal [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4593.2s)]
*  government, including tours of the White House to prompt people to give him more money. I just [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4598.96s)]
*  don't think this is ultimately going to numb the American people. It was close, but I don't think [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4603.12s)]
*  that's how this is going to play out. Yeah, that is what has been surprising about this. I mean, [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4609.68s)]
*  I sort of went into this assuming God only knows what's happening in secret. God only knows what [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4613.44s)]
*  crypto wallets from Singapore are just firing off money to Trump for whatever deal. The reality is [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4618.32s)]
*  it's all happening in public. He's hosting a dinner for the 200 people who buy the most [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4625.12s)]
*  cryptocurrency. I think the top 25 are getting a VIP tour of the White House. Bloomberg News did [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4630.88s)]
*  an analysis looking at the people who own the most of Trump's meme coin, the Trump coin, [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4636.64s)]
*  and the vast majority are from overseas. So you're right. It's just kind of, it's so brazen, [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4642.4s)]
*  it's almost hard to know what to do with it. Yeah, and some of it is playing out in public, [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4648.0s)]
*  but some of it isn't. I know it's hard to follow for some people. And I think some of the bet that [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4651.92s)]
*  Trump made was that the crypto scams would be sort of the most opaque. And a lot of Americans, [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4656.72s)]
*  because they just choose to not want to understand crypto, would look the other way. But it's really [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4664.08s)]
*  not that hard to follow. I mean, there's the meme coin and then there's the stable coin. The meme [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4669.04s)]
*  coin is just this valueless coin that's worth is just dependent on how many people want to buy Trump [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4673.28s)]
*  meme coin on a particular day. And what we know, as you said, is that it's mostly foreign buyers. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4680.56s)]
*  What we know is that Trump makes a bit of money on every single transaction. So every time a foreign [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4686.56s)]
*  buyer, an oligarch or a Saudi prince buys meme coin, they're sending money straight into Trump's [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4692.56s)]
*  pocket. And yet we don't know the names of any of these buyers. So the fact that he's doing it [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4699.200000000001s)]
*  plays out in public, but he is conveniently masking the identity of everybody that buys. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4706.0s)]
*  And of course, we just know what's going on. There are people buying the coin and then going [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4711.6s)]
*  to the White House and saying, hey, I just bought $20 million of Trump coin. Here's what I need from [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4715.76s)]
*  you. That's happening with foreign entities. That's definitely happening with American companies. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4721.12s)]
*  If a mayor did that or a governor did that, they'd be run out of town or a state on a rail. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4726.64s)]
*  And I think we're going to get to the point where people are that set up with Trump doing it. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4732.32s)]
*  Yeah, I hope so, too. There was some bipartisan movement in the Senate to regulate cryptocurrency. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4736.32s)]
*  It fell apart. I was told by some folks who were working on it that that happened because, [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4741.92s)]
*  in part because of some of these reports about foreign actors buying huge amounts of Trump's [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4746.719999999999s)]
*  stable coin, as you mentioned earlier, a person involved in those talks also told me that the [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4751.76s)]
*  crypto industry dumping tens, if not hundreds of millions of dollars into elections, in particular, [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4756.16s)]
*  Sherrod Brown's defeat in the Ohio Senate race last cycle loomed very large in the background. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4761.36s)]
*  How overt is the threat from the crypto industry to lawmakers that they will primary you or defeat [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4768.16s)]
*  you in a general election if you don't do their bidding? And do you have any hope that the Senate [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4774.5599999999995s)]
*  can get that crypto bill in a better place? Listen, I don't know how overt it is. I mean, [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4779.599999999999s)]
*  I've never had one of these crypto bosses or bros come into my office and tell me that if I don't [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4784.24s)]
*  support what they want, they're going to come after me. But of course, I'm in Connecticut, [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4789.04s)]
*  not Ohio. But you're definitely right that there is sort of in the zeitgeist a fear of the crypto [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4793.92s)]
*  industry. And I mean, that's unacceptable. It is unacceptable for any member of Congress to [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4798.32s)]
*  be making decisions based upon what you fear is going to happen to you electorally. I think it's [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4803.36s)]
*  a little bit of an emperor without the sort of level of clothing that we believe they have. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4807.76s)]
*  There's lots of other really powerful interests out there that we piss off on a regular basis, [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4812.08s)]
*  whether it be the oil industry, the pharmaceutical lobby, they have just as much money as the crypto [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4816.24s)]
*  lobby does. And we should just tell a story about how the crypto industry is gouging Americans. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4820.719999999999s)]
*  And we should tell a story about how they are enabling Trump's corruption. The crypto industry [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4825.92s)]
*  is less powerful if you unmask them for their corruption and their unethical behavior. On why [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4830.24s)]
*  the crypto deal fell apart, I think there are a lot of complicated reasons. But amongst them, I hope [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4837.04s)]
*  the fact that the president was exempted. So the bill said that members of Congress [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4841.5199999999995s)]
*  can't issue crypto coin, at least stable coin, which is what the bill was regulating. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4846.639999999999s)]
*  But the president could. At the very moment that Trump was doing the stable coin deal [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4852.48s)]
*  in UAE, in which Trump was getting a big payoff. My hope is that we will not vote on that bill, [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4857.12s)]
*  the Democrats will not support any regulation of stable coin, unless it applies the ethics [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4864.639999999999s)]
*  prohibitions to the president. That seems like a pretty reasonable thing to ask as the president [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4870.64s)]
*  is over there engaged in this gross, gross corruption campaign. Yeah, that seems like the [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4875.360000000001s)]
*  bare minimum. So back to Trump. I mean, it does seem like his kids are the tip of the spear on a [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4879.68s)]
*  lot of the corruption. There's the hypocrisy from Republicans when you compare the comments they [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4884.56s)]
*  made about Hunter Biden to their silence. Now it's galling, but it ultimately misses the real point, [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4890.64s)]
*  which is like corruption is bad no matter what. Right. Like Hunter Biden's activities were [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4896.0s)]
*  cynical and kind of gross. But we're currently watching Don and Eric visit all of these Gulf [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4903.12s)]
*  countries. They're kind of either going right before dad, or they're going right after to [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4909.12s)]
*  collect their real estate deal or whatever prize. I think Jared Kushner is sitting on $3.5 billion [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4912.96s)]
*  worth of Gulf money in his quote unquote investment firm. Surprise, surprise. Jared just [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4919.04s)]
*  came out of the woodwork to say he was helping plan this foreign trip, I believe. What do you [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4924.72s)]
*  think the impact is of like the Trump kids and Kushner on the world stage? What part do they play? [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4929.12s)]
*  I just don't think we should view the kids as separate or distinct at all from the father. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4935.2s)]
*  He says that the kids are running the business and maybe operationally they are making the hour to [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4942.320000000001s)]
*  hour decisions, but Trump is still running the business. So there's just no doubt that he is [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4948.64s)]
*  pulling the strings here. And of course, we see that on a daily basis because he's using his own [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4954.48s)]
*  social media feed to advertise and to market the business ventures that apparently his kids, not [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4958.4s)]
*  him, are in charge of. And I think you saw exactly how it works with that UAE crypto investments. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4965.28s)]
*  The Trump kids along with the Witkoff kid went over there. Literally a day later, [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4973.839999999999s)]
*  the Trump administration announced that they were ready to give UAE what they wanted. And I imagine [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4978.4s)]
*  when he gets to the Emirates, that will be the sort of summation of the corrupt deal. So the kids [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4983.76s)]
*  and the father are just sort of playing individual parts, but it's all the same play. It's all the [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4991.52s)]
*  same game. Did you see the World Liberty Financial, that's the crypto firm that the Trump kids run? [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=4997.2s)]
*  They released a video on social media of their trip to Pakistan where they were met by diplomats. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5002.08s)]
*  They had lights and sirens in the streets. They were meeting with, if not the president, [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5008.64s)]
*  and very senior lawmakers. Again, they're just kind of laying it all out there for us. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5013.2s)]
*  Yeah, and obviously it doesn't end with the kids. Again, Witkoff is in on this. His kid is, [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5017.599999999999s)]
*  and he are making boatloads of money off of these deals. Musk is along for the ride on this trip, [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5024.5599999999995s)]
*  and you have all this reporting that Starlink is one of the investments you need to make as [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5030.8s)]
*  a foreign entity to even get a foot in the door with the Trump administration. There looks as if [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5037.2s)]
*  Saudi Arabia is part of this package of gifts that it's giving the Trump cabal is a deal with [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5041.92s)]
*  Starlink. So you have to pay off Eric, you have to pay off Donald, you have to pay off the Witkoff [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5047.76s)]
*  family, you got to pay off Elon, you got to pay off Donald. And if you do all of those things, [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5052.24s)]
*  then you can ask for something from the American taxpayer. But what we know is that nowhere in that [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5056.4800000000005s)]
*  deal is the American taxpayer. Nowhere in this deal is anything good for US security. The thing [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5061.6s)]
*  they're doing for UAE is a disaster. They are letting UAE have access to the highest technology [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5066.88s)]
*  semiconductors. We've never wanted to do that because we know that the UAE and the Chinese [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5074.4800000000005s)]
*  are super tight, and any technology we give to UAE likely goes straight to China. So China now [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5080.16s)]
*  will get access to these semiconductors, and they will be able to potentially be in a position to [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5085.36s)]
*  lap us when it comes to the future of the global advanced AI industry. That is something that's [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5089.04s)]
*  really bad for the United States, but it's going to happen apparently only because the UAE met [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5095.52s)]
*  Donald Trump's price, which looks to be about a $2 billion cash payment into Trump enterprises. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5101.120000000001s)]
*  Man, it's amazing. And by the way, the UAE, I know they have a lot of friends at Washington, [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5106.240000000001s)]
*  they have an ambassador who is kind of like out and about often at Cafe Milano, etc. But they've [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5109.6s)]
*  also been funding one side of a absolutely brutal civil war in Sudan. They're funding the [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5114.4800000000005s)]
*  mercenary group called the RSS. So there's a lot of tough conversations we should be having [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5119.4400000000005s)]
*  with the UAE that are not about Donald Trump's pocketbook, and there's just no indication that [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5123.68s)]
*  those are happening. Yeah, and frankly that we should have been having during Biden's term [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5127.280000000001s)]
*  as well. I mean, we were doing deals with the UAE, not corrupt deals, but we were financing the UAE's [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5132.72s)]
*  defense infrastructure while they were fueling this brutal civil war. So we're going to force a [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5139.4400000000005s)]
*  vote. There is a pending sale of arms to the UAE, and there's no doubt that that will not be fast [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5145.76s)]
*  tracked. We will force a vote and a debate on the Senate floor where we will talk both about the way [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5152.72s)]
*  that the UAE is funding the civil war and the work that both actors are terrible in UAE, but they're [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5158.320000000001s)]
*  funding the worst of the two, and the way in which the Trump administration is dealing with the UAE [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5163.6s)]
*  are corrupt. So we're not going to stand by. We're going to at least force our Republican colleagues [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5168.320000000001s)]
*  to go on the record on all of this. That's good. I think that's important. So I saw you gave a big [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5172.0s)]
*  floor speech about Trump and corruption this week. I think that's great. And you're sounding the alarm. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5175.84s)]
*  What else can Congress do though, if Republicans seem like they just kind of don't care? They're [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5180.32s)]
*  willing to turn a blind eye. Yeah. Well, I mean, one of the things we can do on the foreign policy [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5185.759999999999s)]
*  corruption is make it clear to these countries that there are repercussions if you pay off an [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5189.92s)]
*  American president, and those repercussions last beyond Trump's term. I mean, maybe UAE and Qatar [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5195.36s)]
*  believe that Trump will be president forever, but that's probably not how it's going to work out. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5201.84s)]
*  There will probably be a Democratic president and Democratic Congress, and they're not going to get [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5206.4s)]
*  the same treatment from a Democratic president if this is the way that they deal with the United [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5210.08s)]
*  States. So Democrats need to communicate to these foreign allies that they should get out of this [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5215.36s)]
*  deal with Trump. They should unilaterally stand down the corruption if they want any long-term [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5220.88s)]
*  healthy relationship with the United States of America. And then we can just do what I've [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5226.32s)]
*  been trying to do, which is mobilize the public. It is curious and a little heartbreaking that it's [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5231.68s)]
*  taken a long time for the public to kind of reach a level of outrage, but that's kind of because [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5235.92s)]
*  we as Democrats didn't talk about it enough. Like the minute the meme coin was issued on [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5242.32s)]
*  inauguration day, we should have been talking about it and very little else. So I think if we [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5246.96s)]
*  work to mobilize the public around this set of issues with a kind of nasty midterm coming up [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5253.04s)]
*  for Republican members of Congress, it may cause them to raise some objections. You see Republicans [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5258.4800000000005s)]
*  starting to tiptoe into objections, at least to the cuttary plane. That might be more likely to [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5264.8s)]
*  happen if we talk about this more in the public and out on the stump. Yeah, I agree with that. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5271.4400000000005s)]
*  The plane is a nice, quite literally bright, shiny object that we can all focus on and talk about. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5276.24s)]
*  But the Steve Bannon flood the zone with shit strategy from Trump is pretty effective and [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5280.8s)]
*  makes it hard, I think, to fire the right bullet at the same target. Final question for you. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5286.08s)]
*  President Trump gave a speech earlier today in Saudi Arabia where he said he's going to get rid [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5291.36s)]
*  of sanctions on Syria and meet with the Syrian President al-Sharah. I had to say I was incredibly [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5296.48s)]
*  excited about that announcement from President Trump. I think it's a politically challenging [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5304.88s)]
*  thing to do to take sanctions off a leader who was admittedly a former terrorist, but it's [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5308.88s)]
*  absolutely the right thing to do if we want this new Syrian government to have a shot of existing. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5314.16s)]
*  By the way, these are sanctions that were all put on the Assad regime, which has now been [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5318.4s)]
*  deposed by these guys. But what was your reaction to that announcement? Did you guys have any heads [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5321.839999999999s)]
*  up on it either? Yeah, there's certainly some commotion that this was being considered by the [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5325.36s)]
*  administration. I agree with you. This is a really important move. Now, there are a lot of [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5330.5599999999995s)]
*  announcements that Trump makes that don't end up actually coming to fruition. So I think we should [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5335.44s)]
*  pour a little bit of salt on this announcement. But yes, as unsavory as these characters are, [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5341.5199999999995s)]
*  this is not the Assad regime. And we should give this Syrian government a chance to show that they [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5347.76s)]
*  are going to build a multi-religious, multi-sectarian society, that they are committed to a relationship [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5356.0s)]
*  with the United States. And we should just understand that if we're not talking to the [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5361.92s)]
*  Syrian regime, then our enemies are. The Russians and the Iranians, many others, the Chinese, are [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5365.68s)]
*  willing to cut a deal. So this is important. We should drop the sanctions. But it probably will [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5372.48s)]
*  necessitate Congress stepping in because some of these sanctions through the Caesar Act [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5378.639999999999s)]
*  are mandatory sanctions. So if Trump wants to get this done and establish a real relationship, [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5382.799999999999s)]
*  or at least a pathway to a relationship with Syria, that's a good thing. We should applaud him when [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5389.599999999999s)]
*  he does something decent, but he probably needs Congress to step in. But we'll see. Well, I guess [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5394.4s)]
*  they always do whatever he tells them to do. So I guess I shouldn't doubt that Republicans who [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5399.759999999999s)]
*  had been pressing against Biden, releasing the sanctions vigorously, will pivot on a dime and [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5403.679999999999s)]
*  all of a sudden announce that Trump has struck a genius move in doing the thing that they thought [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5410.48s)]
*  if Biden did, it was going to be a cataclysm for the Middle East. Yeah, we've got art of the deal [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5416.639999999999s)]
*  here. Senator Murphy, thank you so much for raising everybody's awareness about these issues and for [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5420.639999999999s)]
*  coming on the show. Great to see you. Thanks, man. Thanks again to Senator Murphy for joining the [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5425.04s)]
*  show and we'll talk to you guys next week. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwAC6NTNkMQ&t=5428.4s)]
