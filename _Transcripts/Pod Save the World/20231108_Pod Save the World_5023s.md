Video Description: Tommy Vietor and Ben Rhodes talk about where the world stands one month after Hamas’ attack on Israel, including the declaration from Gaza’s health ministry that 10,000 civilians have been killed, Netanyahu’s statement about Israel taking “indefinite'' security responsibility in Gaza, Biden’s push for a pause in fighting, and the successes and fails of American diplomacy thus far. They also discuss growing calls in Congress for a ceasefire, dismal approval ratings for Biden from Muslim voters and anti-war feelings from younger Americans, and reactions to Obama’s comments on Israel and Gaza. Then they touch on Zelensky’s attempts to keep the war in Ukraine on the world’s radar, Pakistan’s plan to deport up to 1.7 million Afghan migrants, and Boris Johnson’s alleged offer to get injected with COVID-19 on television. Finally, Ben speaks with Jewish American author Nathan Thrall about his new book, “A Day In The Life Of Abed Salama”, which documents the realities of life for Palestinians in the West Bank.

# Israel Rejects Calls for Humanitarian Pause in Gaza | Pod Save The World
**Pod Save the World:** [November 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A)

*  Not elections, but a lot of stuff happening abroad. We are going to talk about how it's been one month after the Hamas attack [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=24.84s)]
*  On Israel and in today's episode [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=32.56s)]
*  We're going to talk through what we know about the Israeli endgame and the conflict [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=34.4s)]
*  Where US diplomacy has been effective and where it has not been effective and then we'll talk about the politics back home and then [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=38.4s)]
*  Former President Obama's thoughts from over the weekend were interesting made a little news [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=45.12s)]
*  Yeah, just just a little Tommy you you know [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=48.76s)]
*  You served up that pitch and he took a swing and you know, we got a lot of ripples. Yeah [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=51.68s)]
*  Something yeah, and then we're also gonna cover the latest news from Russia and Ukraine some grim news for Afghan refugees and Boris Johnson's genius [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=58.96s)]
*  Televised kovat plan. You'll be excited for that and then Ben you did the interview today. Who did you talk to? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  I talked to Nathan thrall. He used to be in charge of [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  Monitoring the Arab-Israeli conflict for the International Crisis Group is now a writer [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=75.72s)]
*  He has a book out recently called the day in the life of Abed Salama, which is really through one story telling [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=80.39999999999999s)]
*  Readers what it's like to live under occupation in the West Bank that book came out just a few days before October 7th. So obviously [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=86.8s)]
*  His book release has been colored by that but we talked about [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=94.44s)]
*  The the story he decided to tell [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=99.11999999999999s)]
*  What the occupation is like for Palestinians what's happening in the West Bank now after October 7th [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=102.83999999999999s)]
*  The reaction to his book including the fact that a bunch of his events have been cancelled [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=109.64s)]
*  About a quarter of them I think and just how to think and talk about this issue the same type of stuff [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=114.24s)]
*  We've been talking on this podcast [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=119.58s)]
*  But it's a great step back look at the broader dynamic and play here and that's why we wanted to have this conversation [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=120.52s)]
*  Yeah, Ben, so I I saw like I learned about Nathan through the controversy around his book [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=126.16s)]
*  I assumed it was some kind of like anti-israel scree [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=131.12s)]
*  But it's just a book about life in the West Bank and Gaza, right? I mean it's following human beings and there's telling their story [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=134.58s)]
*  It's about it's about a father whose kindergarten son died in a tragic bus accident [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=140.04s)]
*  But that it illuminates [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=146.96s)]
*  the nature of life in under occupation [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=149.96s)]
*  And so therefore, you know through this very human story [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=153.24s)]
*  It describes the kind of second-class citizenship of Palestinians and that is a story that people some people don't want to hear right now [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=157.1s)]
*  You know and and so we talk about the complexity of that that dynamic obviously [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=164.82s)]
*  okay, let's turn to the latest news from Gaza because it has been a month since the Hamas terrorist attack and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=169.1s)]
*  The Gaza Health Ministry now says that the death toll since that fighting started has surpassed 10,000 people [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=174.4s)]
*  That ministry is of course run by Hamas but a spokesman at the Pentagon said that the US believes the number of civilian casualties is [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=181.38s)]
*  in the thousands [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=186.9s)]
*  There's no doubt that the the death toll is just horrific [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=188.18s)]
*  The Israeli military or IDF says its ground forces have basically cut Gaza in half and that they are encircling Gaza City in the north [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=191.85999999999999s)]
*  Which is believed to be Hamas a stronghold the IDF also said that as of November 1st [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=198.29999999999998s)]
*  They had dropped at least 10,000 bombs and in the first two weeks of the conflict [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=202.62s)]
*  Most of those bombs dropped were 1,000 pound or 2,000 pound bombs which were intended to target Hezbollah military positions and are incredibly poorly suited [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=207.06s)]
*  For urban environments if you want to avoid civilian casualties [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=215.02s)]
*  Over the weekend thousands of Israelis took to the streets in Tel Aviv to show support [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=218.14000000000001s)]
*  For the families of the hostages being held in Gaza into demand that the Israeli government do more to bring them home [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=222.14000000000001s)]
*  There is less consensus on how exactly to accomplish that goal [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=227.5s)]
*  Some people in the streets are pressuring Netanyahu to consider an offer from Hamas to release captives in exchange for releasing [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=231.18s)]
*  Palestinian prisoners held by Israel [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=237.98000000000002s)]
*  Others are pushing him to continue the military effort until Hamas relents and lets hostages go so it's divided opinion [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=240.10000000000002s)]
*  But everybody wants those people home [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=245.98000000000002s)]
*  Internationally Israel is facing increasing pressure and isolation because of the war South Africa Chile Colombia Honduras and Bolivia [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=248.18s)]
*  Have all withdrawn their ambassadors in protest as have Bahrain Turkey and Chad though those three I think are less [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=255.29999999999998s)]
*  They're hardly long-standing friends of Israel. Although Bahrain is a Abrahamic country [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=261.21999999999997s)]
*  So, you know Ben I wanted to start with just trying to figure out what the Israeli government's endgame is when this conflict [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=266.18s)]
*  Because it's been a month [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=272.21999999999997s)]
*  Here's an excerpt from an interview Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu did with ABC News [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=273.62s)]
*  Who should govern Gaza when this is over? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=278.14s)]
*  Those who don't want to continue the way of Hamas it certainly is not I think Israel will for [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=280.90000000000003s)]
*  An indefinite period will have the overall [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=288.66s)]
*  Security responsibility because we've seen what happens when we don't have it when we don't have that security responsibility [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=292.34000000000003s)]
*  What we have is the eruption of Hamas terror on a scale that we couldn't imagine [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=298.74s)]
*  So reading between the lines that answer [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=303.22s)]
*  I mean it does sound like the plan is to capture the entirety of the Gaza Strip and then occupy it for an indefinite [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=304.82s)]
*  period of time [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=310.3s)]
*  Which is scary for a lot of reasons for civilians for the hostages all the above [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=311.78s)]
*  yeah, I don't know how else to hear that answer and [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=316.46s)]
*  If you look at what's come out the last two or three days [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=320.06s)]
*  It's clearly an intention from the Israeli government to signal [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=325.06s)]
*  This is a more maximalist version of what they could do [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=328.18s)]
*  Because you've seen them resist calls for humanitarian pause, you know, which we can talk about [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=331.94s)]
*  We've seen them [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=337.46000000000004s)]
*  You know move sufficient ground forces to encircle Gaza City that it doesn't feel like these are going to be surgical operations [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=339.38s)]
*  It feels like an effort to be prepared to move in and block by block [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=346.38s)]
*  Consolidate control of Gaza tunnel by time destroyed tunnel by tunnel destroyed tunnel networks [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=352.1s)]
*  And then Netanyahu's comments indicate that you know if they're gonna have quote-unquote security responsibility, I mean they already controlled [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=356.88s)]
*  Everything that could come in and out of Gaza [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=363.96s)]
*  But you know security responsibilities would seem to indicate some kind of long-term open-ended [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=366.23999999999995s)]
*  de facto occupation if not outright occupation of the Gaza Strip and [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=372.52s)]
*  What people have to remember is? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=376.28s)]
*  Number one the hostages [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=380.44s)]
*  You know it it's I think harder to secure their peaceful return to Israel or to other countries [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=383.24s)]
*  Through a war then then through negotiation. That's just you know, that's just the reality of it [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=390.84s)]
*  I'm really glad you said that and like I'm sorry to interrupt [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=395.72s)]
*  But like we get a lot of feedback on the show some of it each week says we're pro-israel or pro-hamas [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=398.04s)]
*  You know what? I mean, it's like that's fine. Everyone's entitled their opinion [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=403.2s)]
*  But like when we are the thing we're constantly thinking about are the civilians [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=405.52s)]
*  You see getting pulled out of rubble in Gaza and these 240 hostages in their families and when you talk about [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=409.8s)]
*  wanting the Israeli government to show restraint when it comes to airstrikes and restraint when it comes to the ground evasion it's because [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=415.24s)]
*  We believe that showing restraint gives the hostages and these civilians the best chance of survival truly [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=421.88s)]
*  I mean, I'm you're seeing reports Hamas is saying that hostages are dying in these airstrikes already [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=427.5s)]
*  I don't know if that's true or not, but I don't know if that's true [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=432.38s)]
*  It stands to reason that if you're dropping a thousand pound bombs on places where the hostages are being held that they're at some risk [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=435.28s)]
*  You know [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=441.28s)]
*  So that's a hostage piece of this but then that the people of Gaza [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=442.76s)]
*  People have to remember that Egypt has said they will not allow them into Egypt [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=446.68s)]
*  and so that means that this entire ground campaign and this continued bombardment of Gaza is going to take place with [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=451.84s)]
*  two million people who have nowhere to go and [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=458.88s)]
*  The pace of destruction that we're seeing of just structures and homes in Gaza, they're going to be homeless [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=462.12s)]
*  They don't have access to food and water and fuel [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=468.40000000000003s)]
*  and so there's no answer in that Netanyahu answer about how are those people going to live and [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=472.20000000000005s)]
*  How are they going to be? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=480.04s)]
*  able to feed themselves and have clean water for their children and [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=482.64000000000004s)]
*  How are they gonna avoid being caught in this this war who is? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=486.8s)]
*  and is Israel's view the Israeli government's view who is Hamas and who's not and [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=491.72s)]
*  And so I think what we've learned [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=498.40000000000003s)]
*  From what Netanyahu said the last couple days and other messaging from the Israeli government is this is likely to be [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=500.92s)]
*  You know at least a month two months if not more frankly [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=506.88s)]
*  and is likely to [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=512.12s)]
*  Kind of move into some type of long-term Israeli occupation of Gaza [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=514.5600000000001s)]
*  Which is a kind of harrowing thought because I don't see how that doesn't lead to a significant amount of additional [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=519.04s)]
*  civilian deaths [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=526.52s)]
*  greater risk for the hostages [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=528.0799999999999s)]
*  continued risk of regional escalation [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=530.24s)]
*  And you know this military objective of destroying Hamas [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=532.88s)]

*  So we wanted to play for you a clip from a guy named Mahmoud Shalabi [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=791.48s)]
*  He's the acting Gaza director for medical aid for Palestinians. We heard from him on an episode several weeks back [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=795.48s)]
*  Here he is describing what it's like when an airstrike hits near your home [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=802.2s)]
*  I was sitting with my kids on the sofa and suddenly there was a huge explosion a [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=805.6800000000001s)]
*  Huge explosion. I've never heard this sound before and [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=812.5600000000001s)]
*  My my child my daughter miss she she started screaming and [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=815.64s)]
*  Panic Lee hysterically crying. I [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=820.92s)]
*  Hugged her and I made sure that she's okay. I told her there is nothing wrong with us. We are all okay [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=824.1999999999999s)]
*  Hamdulillah, there is nothing happening to us and I made sure that all my children the three of them were sitting together and that [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=829.88s)]
*  Their mom was next to them and then I went outside. I rushed outside immediately to see what was happening [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=836.52s)]
*  I opened the door [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=842.12s)]
*  I opened the door and they honestly could not see in front of me and could not breathe [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=844.28s)]
*  it was [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=851.28s)]
*  Grey it was cement. It was gunpowder. It was [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=853.0s)]
*  everything tiny particles [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=857.88s)]
*  Scattered all over around me and I couldn't actually go out. I shut the door closed [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=860.48s)]
*  I took one of the masks the remnants of kovat 19 [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=867.28s)]
*  Soaked it in water put it on my nose and mouth and went rushing outside [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=872.3s)]
*  My neighborhood was destroyed [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=878.34s)]
*  One simple rocket just one rocket [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=880.74s)]
*  So that's an example of what how hard it is for people who are stuck in Gaza and can't leave [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=884.38s)]
*  This is another clip from a man named Hamza Abu Hasee who is a Gaza based journalist [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=889.26s)]
*  Who's talking about the agonizing choice that he has to make as someone with a foreign passport holder [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=894.26s)]
*  But whose family doesn't necessarily have that freedom of movement for cooking [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=900.2199999999999s)]
*  We started to use woods to cook because the gas is finished as well [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=904.5s)]
*  We feel that we are back to the old centuries [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=909.78s)]
*  Honestly, I'm British national and I have my spouse with me [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=913.8199999999999s)]
*  But she is she doesn't have a visa and I cannot leave Gaza without her [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=918.02s)]
*  She is very scared and very fragile. She's basically saying, you know, he can leave but he can't bring his wife with him [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=923.5s)]
*  Yeah, there [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=930.3399999999999s)]
*  There's [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=932.78s)]
*  It's almost impossible to get your mind around what it must feel like [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=935.3399999999999s)]
*  to be in this incredibly condensed already small strip of land and and to be be trapped there, you know, and [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=938.62s)]
*  Again, we've said but we will say every week [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=947.14s)]
*  Hamas what they did on October 7th [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=951.98s)]
*  Absolutely outrageous horrific [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=955.54s)]
*  Initiated this cycle of violence didn't initiate the entire Israeli-Palestinian conflict though. Let's be clear and we talked about that with Nathan Thrall [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=958.38s)]
*  But but there are alternatives to what you just heard [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=966.6999999999999s)]
*  I mean they just are it's not a requirement that bombs are dropped to destroy that man's neighborhood because of what Hamas did [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=970.06s)]
*  and [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=977.98s)]
*  there are two million people that live there and there are four thousand children that are already dead and [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=979.62s)]
*  I [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=985.5s)]
*  Just think that people need to create enough space to [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=987.22s)]
*  Understand that that guy's not Hamas, you know, yeah. Yeah [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=992.58s)]
*  so, you know the Biden administration they are [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=997.22s)]
*  Trying every day to manage this conflict the messaging and diplomacy about the war has evolved albeit slowly [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1001.78s)]
*  Initially the White House basically only stressed that Israel had a right to defend itself [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1008.9399999999999s)]
*  But for the past ten days or so [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1012.94s)]
*  Officials like Tony Blinken the Secretary of State have been calling for humanitarian pause to allow aid into Gaza [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1015.4200000000001s)]
*  President Biden reportedly raised the idea of a humanitarian pause directly with BB Netanyahu during a phone call on Monday [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1021.7s)]
*  So far those calls have been pretty firmly rejected in that ABC News interview [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1028.5s)]
*  We heard earlier Netanyahu said there will be no general ceasefire without the release of hostages and then he suggested he might consider [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1032.3s)]
*  quote [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1039.1000000000001s)]
*  Tactical little pauses an hour here an hour there to enable humanitarian goods to come in or hostages to leave [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1040.18s)]
*  So not a lot of time [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1045.7s)]
*  The New York Times reported that behind the scenes the US is pushing Israel to do more to protect civilians [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1047.3400000000001s)]
*  They want more intelligence gathering. They want better targeting of airstrikes to reduce civilian casualties and [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1052.3400000000001s)]
*  As part of that effort they are preparing to send Israel smaller bombs to help avoid civilian casualties [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1058.26s)]
*  So like in practice I get it [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1065.26s)]
*  But a very tough message to explain to the world how sending more weapons to Israel could avoid civilian casualties [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1068.34s)]
*  Tony Blinken has been all over the world. He was in Israel the West Bank Jordan Turkey in Iraq [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1076.8999999999999s)]
*  Here's a clip from Tony. I think we've had important conversations and [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1081.62s)]
*  More than conversations we're making sure that the [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1087.06s)]
*  different influence and relationships [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1091.1399999999999s)]
*  That countries in the region have including the countries that I visited or spoke to that they're using that to make sure that this [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1093.3400000000001s)]
*  Conflict and crisis doesn't spread and that's that's critical and I think [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1099.98s)]
*  Countries are very much engaged in trying to make sure that that that doesn't happen [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1104.66s)]
*  So that's important and sometimes the absence of something bad happening [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1108.5400000000002s)]
*  May not be the most obvious evidence of progress, but it is something we've talked about before on the show [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1113.8200000000002s)]
*  And I remember talking with you and government like sometimes diplomacy [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1119.46s)]
*  Prevents conflicts from happening or from spreading [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1122.66s)]
*  I think one way to interpret the specifics there is they're trying to keep Iran out of this fight [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1125.54s)]
*  They're trying to keep it lit on things regionally by the way, Tony [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1129.3s)]
*  Did the went to the countries I talked about Middle East and then he went to Tokyo South Korea and India for consultations around the [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1132.14s)]
*  For the g7 so I do not envy that guys. Yeah travel schedule with Ben. What do you you know a month in? [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1137.8600000000001s)]
*  What do you make of the US diplomatic effort so far? Like what do you think has succeeded and failed in your view? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1143.78s)]
*  So I guess on the on the succeed succeeding part [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1148.58s)]
*  look clearly the US had a [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1152.74s)]
*  prioritization around [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1155.78s)]
*  Preventing that kind of regional escalation Iran getting in or all of its proxies getting in [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1157.26s)]
*  Hizballah getting in and so you had the deployment of US aircraft carriers to the region you had [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1161.1s)]
*  Clearly the US messaging Iran through everybody they could probably third countries China Turkey Oman Turkey Qatar [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1166.26s)]
*  Messaging the Iranians stay out of this when the Iranian proxies were attacking US forces in Syria and in Iraq [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1173.62s)]
*  You had US airstrikes on the IRGC. So this messaging wasn't just diplomacy was also militarily thus far [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1181.02s)]
*  You know, it hasn't spread [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1188.1s)]
*  Nasrallah Hassan Nasrallah the leader of his blood gave a speech last week highly anticipated [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1190.58s)]
*  Condemning Israel, of course, but you know stopping short of getting in the war his was been relatively restrained [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1195.54s)]
*  On Israel's northern border Iran has not gotten more directly involved [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1201.66s)]
*  And so I think what Tony's alluding to it in terms of not spreading is thus far. It has been contained [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1205.5800000000002s)]
*  Generally to Gaza and and to the West Bank [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1213.0600000000002s)]
*  So there's some success there [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1217.98s)]
*  It's hard to draw a direct causation, but but that hasn't happened and that's good [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1220.9s)]
*  I [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1225.3s)]
*  Also think there's an effort to try to probably keep some of a lid on just kind of this blowing up the region generally [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1226.66s)]
*  You know, and we don't know what's happening inside of countries to you know prevent. I don't know [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1233.3000000000002s)]
*  attacks on embassies and things like that [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1239.5s)]
*  And then in terms of Israel itself [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1241.74s)]
*  You know, there have been small successes. We had the release of a few hostages [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1244.74s)]
*  Negotiated through Qatar [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1250.26s)]
*  We had some trucks periodically getting in across the Rafa crossing with humanitarian assistance for Gaza and that seems like that was you know [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1251.74s)]
*  largely the result of US diplomacy, I think they also pushed them really hard to [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1259.46s)]
*  Restore internet and communications in Gaza when it went out that that's right [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1263.94s)]
*  Yeah, so so you know that that's on the positive side of the ledger. I think on the negative side [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1268.06s)]
*  Look when we were in government you and I you know, and I was in these meetings for eight years you're in them for [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1274.18s)]
*  More than half of that [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1280.94s)]
*  The there there was one there were two ways of thinking about I mean more than two [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1282.6200000000001s)]
*  But I'll simplify two ways of thinking about the relationship with someone like Netanyahu [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1287.56s)]
*  There was a view that I think Joe Biden has which you have to completely throw your arms around Netanyahu [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1292.42s)]
*  No daylight publicly back him completely in public show love for Israel [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1297.38s)]
*  And then that's gonna give you some leverage to affect Israeli decision-making [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1301.78s)]
*  Then I think Obama's view was you know what like we we have Israel's back as a country [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1305.6200000000001s)]
*  But when BB Netanyahu is leader the Israeli government does things that we really don't like we're gonna call it out and you can [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1310.8600000000001s)]
*  Go back and look at the previous Gaza war [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1316.9s)]
*  You know, we you know [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1319.04s)]
*  We called certain airstrikes disgraceful and we you know [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1320.3400000000001s)]
*  We were much more forward-leaning in some of the language used to criticize certain Israeli actions and now that didn't you know? [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1323.1000000000001s)]
*  Affected Netanyahu's decision-making per se but what it did do is signal to the rest of the world [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1329.26s)]
*  Hey, we're not we're not all behind this like we we you know [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1334.46s)]
*  We see the Palestinian loss of life as equal to the Israeli loss of life and we are trying our best to kind of rein this in [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1338.4s)]
*  And so that that that was a an approach that [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1345.9s)]
*  Maybe didn't totally affect BB's calculus, but at least allowed the United States to position itself in it as [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1349.26s)]
*  Working for different outcomes. I think that where where they've had serious problems is that that approach of [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1356.7s)]
*  Hugging BB to get new things that's failed [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1363.26s)]
*  It hasn't worked and we should just say that you know and and [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1366.18s)]
*  Because you have the Secretary of State go over there to get a humanitarian pause and you have the Israeli Prime Minister say [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1370.94s)]
*  No, I'm not doing that [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1375.94s)]
*  He's also implicit in this pause message, right? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1377.5s)]
*  And you see this in Franklin for his book about the 2021 Gaza crisis was basically that Biden gave [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1379.78s)]
*  Netanyahu about 10 11 days worth of leeway and then he finally got on the phone with him and said hey buddy [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1386.38s)]
*  You're at a runway the strikes had to stop and they stopped that was kind of the story [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1391.34s)]
*  We were told about 2021 but either that call has not been made in this case or they don't want to make it or BB's [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1396.06s)]
*  Saying I'm not gonna do what you say. Yeah, and and let's they said this at the time, you know [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1403.02s)]
*  Like that they they learned the lesson of Obama's failure, you know in and and and look I mean [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1409.02s)]
*  This isn't about one piece for me right or wrong. It's about [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1415.58s)]
*  What what is working because when because also on the pause itself and just kind of focus it on that [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1419.3s)]
*  You know, I've talked to some people and and and different governments, you know [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1426.62s)]
*  I think what the Arabs are advocating for the Arab governments is like something in between a [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1430.86s)]
*  Short pause in a ceasefire. It's basically like five days seven days [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1436.58s)]
*  Something that would allow you to put in massive amounts of humanitarian aid could get into Gaza [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1440.26s)]
*  Maybe get a significant amount of wounded people out and have really intensified negotiations get hostages out that makes a lot of sense to me [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1444.1000000000001s)]
*  You know [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1450.94s)]
*  BB even when he's trying to throw a bone to the US [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1452.5800000000002s)]
*  It's like maybe even our as you said like maybe we'll have like two hour pause to get 20 trucks in he said in such [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1454.76s)]
*  A dismissive way. Yeah. Yeah [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1459.3s)]
*  And so I think they're in this position where you can tell that the administration is increasingly frustrated with BB [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1460.5800000000002s)]
*  They're kind of putting out on background, you know, we don't like this. We're advocating for a longer pause [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1465.14s)]
*  But to that point about the phone call, you know that you just made Tommy [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1471.14s)]
*  I mean, I think that's the core point is that at what point? [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1474.14s)]
*  Because we haven't even done the supplemental yet, right? So if we're gonna [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1478.5800000000002s)]
*  Assuming that does go forward, you know, whether how could be 15,000 Palestinian stead [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1484.26s)]
*  Half of Gaza could be destroyed by then and in the middle of that we're gonna ship over 15 billion dollars [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1490.94s)]
*  At the same time that we're kind of leaking out on background that we don't like what's happening [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1496.1799999999998s)]
*  I mean, that's what worries me is that how does that impact? [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1500.32s)]
*  Obviously Palestinian lives. How does it impact every other US priority in the world? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1504.1s)]
*  You know, we've talked a lot in this podcast about how the global south [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1509.78s)]
*  Didn't want to get behind save our support for Ukraine because they thought it was hypocritical [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1513.2199999999998s)]
*  That was before the Gaza war. Yep, and I'm just trying to imagine the US trying to get support for anything [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1516.54s)]
*  If this goes the way it looks like it's going yeah [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1521.8999999999999s)]
*  And you know, there was a report on October 27th in the Washington Post [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1524.62s)]
*  where a Hamas [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1528.98s)]
*  Remember the Hamas leadership based in Beirut said that there were negotiations brokered by Egypt and Qatar [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1530.98s)]
*  Where Hamas proposed to release all foreign civilian hostages in exchange for a five-day ceasefire? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1536.82s)]
*  And then Israeli civilian hostages would be released if additional demands were met [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1541.46s)]
*  He said including the release of Palestinian women and children in Israeli prisons in the Arab world [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1545.62s)]
*  Israeli prisons in the opening of the Rafa border crossing so wounded civilians can receive care in Egypt and fuel food medicine and water can enter Gaza now [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1550.78s)]
*  obviously like there's a lot of [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1558.98s)]
*  Stipulations there like you have to figure out a way to make Hamas uphold its end of the deal [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1561.58s)]
*  But if your priority is getting back hostages and protecting civilians in Gaza [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1565.82s)]
*  I think trying to negotiate that kind of deal would make a lot of sense. That doesn't mean that after five days [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1571.86s)]
*  there's a permanent ceasefire and [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1577.66s)]
*  Israelis go on with Hamas existing in its current forum in Gaza [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1580.14s)]
*  Like to your point you've made earlier like we both anticipate that the Mossad will hunt Hamas [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1584.5800000000002s)]
*  Leaders to the end of the earth were part of this terrorist attack and there will be continued military operations [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1590.3000000000002s)]
*  But I mean if you want to get hostages home, this seems like an opportunity. Yeah, you've made a really important point [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1595.74s)]
*  I understand that Israel doesn't want to accept and shouldn't accept [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1601.3000000000002s)]
*  some reality in which they're forced to live next to [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1606.3000000000002s)]
*  Hamas with a bunch of rockets for the for the for the rest of you know for the foreseeable future here [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1609.66s)]
*  The question is there is there a much is there just a different approach to take here to dislodge Hamas to kind of end [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1616.94s)]
*  Them as a political entity with a lot of support from Arab partners that also don't want Hamas around and yeah [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1623.3000000000002s)]
*  I would fully expect Israel to continue to target [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1629.3000000000002s)]
*  Hamas leadership and try to deny Hamas certain military capabilities and to try to have there be but but again the thing that's gonna do [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1633.18s)]
*  That over time is there for there to be a different Palestinian leadership than Hamas in Gaza [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1639.46s)]
*  And and I worry that just destroying Gaza [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1643.78s)]
*  It doesn't accomplish that question of what are you replacing Hamas with? [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1647.9s)]
*  What are you building and into people listening this getting really frustrated and saying I don't understand why you guys can't get behind [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1651.9s)]
*  Israel has every right to dismantle Hamas [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1659.58s)]
*  The way they are doing this now with a government led by Bibi Nanyahu [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1662.94s)]
*  Remember this isn't a question of what government you want to project on Israel. It's led by this guy Netanyahu [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1666.82s)]
*  They are doing it this way they are doing in a way that is killing a lot of innocent people and [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1673.3s)]
*  And and I don't think that is the way to accomplish what Israel wants to accomplish and I also think that has obviously profound [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1679.06s)]
*  humanitarian consequences for Palestinians and frankly profound consequences for US interests that could could go for many years here [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1687.02s)]
*  Yeah, I mean humanitarian consequences in the short term long term [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1692.5s)]
*  It's the most likely way to repeat this cycle of violence [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1695.66s)]
*  Yeah, what one really frustrating piece of pushback you're seeing in the press from Israeli officials is saying, you know [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1698.5400000000002s)]
*  Look at past US wars including World War two. There were unbelievable levels of civilian casualties [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1704.02s)]
*  You know, how couldn't you criticize us when there is this history of like, you know, nuking Japan, for example [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1709.78s)]
*  I just find that to be such like obviously wars are hell civilians have died in every conflict [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1715.5800000000002s)]
*  I'm not trying to be naive here [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1720.3799999999999s)]
*  but like the notion that the military effort required to defeat the Nazis is somehow comparable to [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1721.78s)]
*  Taking out Hamas's leadership feels crazy to me and it just seems like kind of a glib [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1727.9399999999998s)]
*  Way to dismiss civilian casualties and really to like take on the issue and try to do something about it [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1733.78s)]
*  Yeah, it's also the point that those laws of war [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1738.74s)]
*  Were developed after World War two to prevent that from happening [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1742.98s)]
*  I mean every time I hear that talking but I'm like, well, yeah, everybody got together and decided [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1745.82s)]
*  Hey, we shouldn't do that again. And that doesn't mean the US has like clean hands after that. I mean Vietnam [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1749.4599999999998s)]
*  Enormous amounts of indiscriminate bombing horrific, but I think that's bad [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1755.54s)]
*  and and again you have [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1759.54s)]
*  What's so frustrating about this whole argument is because I've seen this to you have [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1762.6999999999998s)]
*  international laws of war [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1768.8999999999999s)]
*  not for like [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1770.74s)]
*  Because there's such a thing as an easy war where you know [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1772.1799999999998s)]
*  You have them because you want to restrain the loss of civilian life in any armed conflict and [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1776.36s)]
*  So if you start to say and this is by the way, we had issues with delivering cluster munitions to the Ukrainians, you know [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1782.7199999999998s)]
*  Even though that's not technically I think a violation of the laws of war [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1790.24s)]
*  If you if you start to say well the laws of war don't apply to the wars that that certain words that we care about [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1793.7199999999998s)]
*  Like well then nobody's ever gonna there's no incentive for anybody ever fall any laws of war, right? [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1800.96s)]
*  Right. So calls for a ceasefire or some sort of humanitarian pause are slowly growing in Congress [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1805.0s)]
*  Last week senator dick Durbin called for a ceasefire [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1810.2800000000002s)]
*  Albeit a conditional one where Hamas releases prisoners first, but he used the word ceasefire [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1813.0s)]
*  Which yeah, like two weeks before was getting people run out of organizations [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1817.76s)]
*  We're just saying it out loud [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1820.88s)]
*  Senator Brian shots called for a humanitarian pause saying quote the scale of human suffering right now is untenable [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1822.1200000000001s)]
*  Senator Chris Murphy said quote it's time for Israel's friends to recognize [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1827.64s)]
*  The current approach is causing an unacceptable level of civilian harm does not appear likely to achieve the goal of ending the threat from Hamas [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1831.3200000000002s)]
*  I urge Israel to immediately reconsider this approach [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1838.24s)]
*  Those statements followed a number of similar calls from Democrats in the house [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1840.92s)]
*  And then we have some survey data Ben NBC News reported on a poll in Michigan [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1844.64s)]
*  That surveyed President Biden standing with Arab and Muslim Democrats and younger voters [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1849.2s)]
*  They basically did an over sample of those two categories and it found that only [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1854.8s)]
*  16% of Arab and Muslim voters surveyed said they would vote for Biden if the election was held today [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1859.8799999999999s)]
*  Previous poll suggests that Biden got about 70% of Arab and Muslim voters in 2020. So that would be really bad [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1865.3999999999999s)]
*  61% of voters under 30 said they'd vote for Biden if the election were held today with 56% giving him a poor rating on the [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1872.84s)]
*  Israel-Palestinian conflict Michigan is home to about 240,000 Muslims [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1878.96s)]
*  So that kind of drop in support would tip the election to Republicans. I should note that like we have some friends in the in the Biden administration [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1883.28s)]
*  I talked to them and they'll say to you look his handling of this conflict. It's actually probably the most popular thing [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1890.56s)]
*  He's doing right now the most popular issue area and maybe that's true [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1896.84s)]
*  But I do worry it's because like some you know, right wingers are saying they support Biden on this issue [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1900.54s)]
*  But they would never vote for him. And so, you know, look obviously [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1904.92s)]
*  People might be saying like why you guys talking about the political considerations [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1908.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, look Joe Biden is a political animal right like to his credit to his detriment [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1910.6s)]
*  But like he tends to find the center of an issue and like will listen when he's pushed on issues [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1914.32s)]
*  So that's why activism really matters. But also, you know [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1918.78s)]
*  There's this weird sense to that people seem surprised that there's a generational divide within the Democratic Party [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1922.76s)]
*  Emerging on support for Israel and like I don't I keep reading these articles. I'm like one [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1929.9199999999998s)]
*  Younger people have always made up the bulk of an anti-war movement. Yes, essentially [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1934.76s)]
*  So no surprise and two if you're under 30, the only Israel you've known is [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1939.76s)]
*  led by BB Netanyahu a [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1944.84s)]
*  right-wing [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1947.04s)]
*  Nationalists like hard-right Republican who you know went all in in support for Trump [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1948.52s)]
*  There are a pack of line groups like DMFI that are getting involved in Democratic primaries like running ads attacking progressive Democrats in the house [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1954.24s)]
*  Like when you make those political decisions, there's going to be a political fallout [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1961.4399999999998s)]
*  Which I think you are probably seeing reflected in [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1966.64s)]
*  Younger generations saying wait. No, I actually I don't support what Israel is doing. I don't support those values [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1970.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think the Netanyahu point you can't have a situation. This guy's been prime minister forever [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1975.76s)]
*  Like you said, you know come completely tried to undermine obviously, you know [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1981.48s)]
*  Our boss Barack Obama to the point of flying to Washington at the invitation of Republicans [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1986.46s)]
*  To make a speech to Congress against the Democratic [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1992.04s)]
*  President's foreign policy completely embraced Trump his reelection campaigns figure yet billboards of himself with Trump, right? [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=1995.68s)]
*  was literally trying to [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2003.6s)]
*  Dismantle Israeli democracy before October 7th with mass protests in the street [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2006.04s)]
*  So the idea that that the young bird is supposed to memory hold that you know [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2010.48s)]
*  No, this is the the it matters who's running a country, you know, and and [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2015.0s)]
*  Netanyahu is a guy who is in charge in Israel right now and I think the other point I'd make about these polls [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2020.32s)]
*  You know, I'm not as as as you know plugged in as you guys are a pot say America about this stuff [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2027.2s)]
*  But just talking and interacting with younger people and and Arab and Muslim voters that I know [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2034.3999999999999s)]
*  The thing the reason I'd be concerned about it is as you said some of the support that Biden's getting is probably [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2040.92s)]
*  Some people that you know are not [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2048.96s)]
*  Gonna vote for Joe Biden the end of the day [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2051.8s)]
*  When I talk to people this is not like a a small issue for them, you know [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2054.2400000000002s)]
*  If you're the Arab community in Michigan, it's not like they're gonna forget this a year [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2059.0800000000004s)]
*  You know, I think there's a view that like maybe you know, eight ten months or not [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2063.8s)]
*  They're like, you know what? I didn't like his Israel policy back in last year [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2068.56s)]
*  But you know, I don't like Trump [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2071.6400000000003s)]
*  This feels like an issue a really motivating issue a voting issue for a bunch of constituencies in Democratic Party and [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2073.16s)]
*  So from a policy perspective [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2080.92s)]
*  You know the question becomes what can you do to show? [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2084.16s)]
*  That you you care about Palestinian life that even if you're not exerting a ton of control over what Israel's doing right now [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2087.6s)]
*  Can you do something to kind of build back next year an aspiration for a Palestinian state or to a resumption of? [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2094.2000000000003s)]
*  Palestinian life [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2102.4s)]
*  in society [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2104.56s)]
*  but also can you can you speak to those people in a way that is not just saying like [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2106.6s)]
*  you know, we support Israel, but we want them to follow the laws of war or you know, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2111.48s)]
*  Putting out on background that you know [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2116.6s)]
*  You want you have to go and engage those communities in a sustained way and show that you're hearing them and that you know [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2118.16s)]
*  They that you might disagree with them. That's you know, that's that that may very well be the end of it [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2124.68s)]
*  But I worry that just letting that sit [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2129.5600000000004s)]
*  Is politically not a great idea and and also [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2133.2400000000002s)]
*  Dismissing it because some of those people are acting like fucking lunatic anti-semites, you know [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2138.28s)]
*  Like we can't reinforce enough blaming Jews what the Israeli government's doing is anti-semitism and is terrible [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2142.8s)]
*  but I think [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2148.8s)]
*  Dismissing all of those polls because you can point to some nutcases who are like tearing down postages of hostages or [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2150.48s)]
*  Doing some stupid shit on campuses [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2158.44s)]
*  That's that's actually even worse because you have to be able to separate out like the bad actors from just people who are worried about this [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2160.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and you know, I mean I think also the other thing you're saying a lot of is people like [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2167.6000000000004s)]
*  You know [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2172.6000000000004s)]
*  Scoffing at the suggestion that the Arab or Muslim American community is gonna vote for Trump over Biden [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2173.88s)]
*  It's like guys. They're just gonna stay home [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2179.96s)]
*  Yeah [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2181.4s)]
*  you can't be so condescending about for a third party and also the there a lot of these folks who are showing up these [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2181.6000000000004s)]
*  Polls frustrated about the current handling of Gaza were mad in 2021 about the handling of that war in Gaza [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2186.68s)]
*  Yeah, so it's not like a new issue [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2193.56s)]
*  Also, lastly Joe Biden's trying to pass this massive supplemental funding bill that includes support for Israel [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2195.04s)]
*  there are very little bit of humanitarian support for the Palestinians the [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2200.16s)]
*  Ukraine funding like politics matter. Forget the Taiwan weapons [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2205.12s)]
*  Taiwan weapons in there. Yeah, so many weapons, you know [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2209.48s)]
*  Like the political support really matters when you're trying to move a bill like that and it's getting harder every day [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2211.8199999999997s)]
*  But so finally then, you know, we were in Chicago last weekend [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2216.46s)]
*  It was this very fun incredible reunion of you know, sort of the Obama team and you know without you know [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2218.9s)]
*  Wallowing in our own nostalgia. It was very fun. Just kind of remember a different era in our politics [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2224.94s)]
*  The pre Trump era. Yeah, mostly but um, we interviewed him for positive America. The full interview is out [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2230.7000000000003s)]
*  It was out earlier this week, but I asked him about Gaza [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2237.26s)]
*  Specifically what his advice was for people who want to understand and engage in this conversation about the conflict [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2240.6200000000003s)]
*  But they don't want to say the wrong thing. They don't want to upset anybody. They're terrified by the you know [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2246.02s)]
*  Horrible debate that's happening on Twitter every single day. It was a long answer [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2251.34s)]
*  So we're not gonna play the whole thing. But here's a brief clip the problem with the social media and trying to tick-tock [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2255.38s)]
*  Activism and trying to debate this on that [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2263.54s)]
*  is [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2266.5s)]
*  You can't speak the truth [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2267.58s)]
*  You can pretend to speak the truth you can speak one side of the truth [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2269.86s)]
*  and in some cases you can try to maintain your [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2274.82s)]
*  moral innocence, but that won't solve the problem and so if you want to solve the problem then [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2279.42s)]
*  You have to take in the whole truth [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2287.2200000000003s)]
*  and you then have to [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2289.94s)]
*  admit [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2293.1400000000003s)]
*  Nobody's hands are clean [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2295.86s)]
*  that [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2298.26s)]
*  All of us are complicit [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2300.78s)]
*  To some degree. I think the two keys understanding that comment are better one. He's been writing his memoir [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2303.5800000000004s)]
*  Second passage second book and thinking about all the problems we didn't solve and it's clear that's kind of eating at him including this [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2309.7000000000003s)]
*  And then two you can tell that Obama [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2316.5800000000004s)]
*  Finds the way social media has sent us to our corners. We no longer talk to each other [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2319.94s)]
*  We no longer try to dissuade each other persuade each other to be enormously frustrating [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2325.9s)]
*  But what'd you make of that answer and I don't know his willingness to kind of dive into it. Yeah, no, I [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2330.06s)]
*  Look, there's so many dimensions of this because there's answer and then there's a reaction to his answer that we've seen the last couple days [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2335.1400000000003s)]
*  I mean, first of all, I think that the very important point he makes there [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2340.34s)]
*  is [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2345.34s)]
*  Which actually I think was probably as much directed at the left of this conversation as it is that you know [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2346.78s)]
*  the kind of pro-israel side of this conversation is that [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2351.46s)]
*  Social media incentivizes only talking to people who agree with you or attacking people who disagree with you and anybody who wants to actually change something [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2353.86s)]
*  Needs to be able to persuade somebody else and and also that there there are competing narratives in this conflict [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2360.5s)]
*  That it is absolutely the case that Israel [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2366.02s)]
*  Has been targeted by its neighbors [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2369.42s)]
*  by terrorism by invasions of [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2372.5s)]
*  From Arab states by any semitism and by Hamas on October 7th [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2376.62s)]
*  It is also entirely the case the Palestinians were massively displaced have been living as [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2381.0600000000004s)]
*  Under occupation in some cases have been displaced and we could go on on the point [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2388.02s)]
*  Is that you have to have space for both of these narratives to coexist? [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2391.82s)]
*  You can't just say one is entirely right and the other just doesn't exist [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2395.42s)]
*  And so that's a very Obama thing to be able to say the whole truth has to be confronted in order for us to find [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2399.46s)]
*  Any way forward? So that's one feeling I had [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2404.86s)]
*  The second was just a real disgust at the kind of you know, right-wing [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2408.06s)]
*  Funhouse mirrors with this and by the way some of the mainstream political media in this country [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2413.8199999999997s)]
*  Because the things that he said that are being seen as like whoa [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2418.54s)]
*  I can't believe he said that are essentially that he said that there's a brutal occupation of Palestinians and [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2421.22s)]
*  To that he said no one's hands are clean. Does anybody? [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2426.06s)]
*  Like have other language to describe what is going on because there is a military occupation of like that [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2430.58s)]
*  occupation is a controversial world word is is is is only like an indication of the stupidity of American political discourse because [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2438.34s)]
*  There is a military occupation of the West Bank that has been underway since 1967 [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2446.7s)]
*  The Israeli military is in the West Bank and Palestinians live under military occupation if you want to invent [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2451.8199999999997s)]
*  What else are you gonna call it? Like and so the fact that it's controversial that in 2023 [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2457.98s)]
*  I don't even I came to 77 87 97 0 7 17 [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2463.58s)]
*  Almost 60 years after 1967 that that it's controversial to see occupation. That's absurd and then saying no one hands are clean [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2468.66s)]
*  It doesn't mean that he doesn't think that what Hamas did isn't horrific [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2475.58s)]
*  But does anybody think that we've all handled this well, you know, like like like like I had some reporters [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2478.9s)]
*  You know, you know when like political reporters email you because they want you to take the bait [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2484.9s)]
*  So I got those like wow and like ten exclamation points like no one hands are clean, you know, and I'm like [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2489.14s)]
*  Wow, what like what? [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2495.4199999999996s)]
*  This is absurd that this is controversial [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2498.4199999999996s)]
*  So it's it's part of the the dumb way in which we just like because this conflict is so complicated [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2500.54s)]
*  It's easier to make it like some American politics thing. Yes, you know, and it's not it's like people are getting killed [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2506.5s)]
*  Like Israelis got killed by Hamas Palestinians are getting killed in Gaza [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2512.54s)]
*  And it's easier to like ignore that and be like whoa did Obama like do something that you know is controversial [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2515.7s)]
*  Let's focus on that. So I was I was pretty disappointed in that and then he was self-reflective [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2522.3399999999997s)]
*  But I'm gonna say again because I'll just I will be the Obama defender on this one. You have an Iran deal in place [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2527.18s)]
*  You don't have the embassy moved to Jerusalem and you don't have an Abraham Accords. It totally cuts out the Palestinians [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2533.7799999999997s)]
*  I don't think we're here. I'm just gonna say it because everybody else is saying like well Obama gave money to Iran [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2538.9399999999996s)]
*  That's why this happened. But no, maybe Trump pulled out of a deal [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2543.56s)]
*  There was deescalating tensions and then ratcheted up those tensions [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2546.92s)]
*  I mean like so if you want to play that game like you don't have the facts on your side [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2550.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2555.72s)]
*  I was like literally sitting there for like seven minutes or ever long the answer was and like [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2556.22s)]
*  Really appreciated in hearing him talk out loud in that way and it just felt honest right in the room [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2560.64s)]
*  It felt really good. It felt it felt real. It felt honest. It felt self-reflective felt self-critical [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2566.16s)]
*  And it made me appreciate him all over again [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2572.1600000000003s)]
*  But my broken internet brain was going to all the ways in real time that it was gonna get twisted [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2574.0s)]
*  And so of course the right wing went with the Iran deal piece and was like, oh Obama [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2578.6400000000003s)]
*  You funded this heretic and then the left I saw the sort of lefties dunking on him with this [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2582.96s)]
*  Ta-Nehisi Coates clip where Ta-Nehisi is talking about visiting the West Bank and how you always hear that the conflict is complex [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2587.88s)]
*  But when you get there you see that it's actually very simple and what he's talking about is the point you are making that like [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2593.84s)]
*  The immorality of occupation is not complicated. It's black and white. It's very clear that when you're living occupation [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2599.16s)]
*  There's nothing just or moral about a Palestinian not being able to walk on the same street and as an Israeli, right? [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2604.8399999999997s)]
*  That's one of the examples he used but Obama's talking about there is the history is complicated [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2610.3999999999996s)]
*  Figuring out a solution to the problem is complicated getting two sides of some in the political will to solve the problem is complicated [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2614.3199999999997s)]
*  So that's like the experience that Obama was drawing from but to just been to really crystallize the stupidity of it [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2621.2599999999998s)]
*  The political playbook [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2627.52s)]
*  Wrote up that when Obama said nobody's hands are clean that [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2629.52s)]
*  The quote could be lumped into quote those notorious [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2634.12s)]
*  Evocative phrases politicians used in moments of passions sick such as Bush's notorious missions mission accomplished now [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2638.24s)]
*  First of all, I believe it mission accomplished was written on a banner on an aircraft carrier [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2645.66s)]
*  It wasn't like a slip of the tongue from Bush, but also what the fuck are you talking? What does that even mean? [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2652.0s)]
*  He's not even president. I'd say it's now by the way to like it's just so stupid. I mean, it's so stupid [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2656.52s)]
*  It's just like oh, can we create a controversy around something? [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2661.04s)]
*  Obama said that is self-evidently true [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2663.96s)]
*  Like most of the billions of people on earth who are familiar with this conflict would hear what Obama said and be like, yeah [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2666.68s)]
*  That's basically true [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2672.4s)]
*  But the authors of political playbook are like how can we write something that is so fucking annoying and over-the-top? [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2674.48s)]
*  That maybe some other people will be forced to follow our you know daily newsletter [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2680.84s)]
*  It's a shot at by yeah, it's a shot at Hillary's a shot at Biden's Obama unpacking his thoughts about you think he didn't run [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2686.0s)]
*  The initial statement by the Biden administration, of course [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2691.24s)]
*  He did it's just talking about the whole thing is just there was a lot of stupidity [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2693.2s)]
*  But but I encourage people actually listen to the whole answer not because everything is right that he says [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2697.16s)]
*  It's just like somebody who's smart trying to unpack how they're thinking and feeling about it, you know [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2701.64s)]
*  And and you can disagree with parts of it as anything [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2706.0s)]
*  Anybody says on this issue someone will disagree with but the idea that it's some kind of usually consequential statement [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2709.64s)]
*  No, he's a human being watching the same [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2715.8s)]
*  News reports that we are and he's horrified by them and he was reacting in real time and I appreciated that honesty and vulnerability [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2718.48s)]
*  We're going very long. So we have a couple more quick things where we get the bends interviews [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2724.36s)]
*  So we did want to go through some of the news about the war in Ukraine because of course [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2727.44s)]
*  That war is still raging even though our focus has been more on Gaza lately [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2731.1200000000003s)]
*  So President Zelensky is doing his best to stay on Washington's radar screen on Sunday [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2734.92s)]
*  He went on meet the press where he delivered this memorable sound bite you going. Do you ever feel [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2739.88s)]
*  defeated I [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2745.64s)]
*  Have a lot of power [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2748.56s)]
*  But even feeling strong and have a lot of energy [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2751.36s)]
*  It doesn't mean that we want to fight all our life [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2758.36s)]
*  Because the price is high like I said because the war takes the best of us [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2763.2400000000002s)]
*  The best heroes the best men women children, that's it [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2769.7200000000003s)]
*  But we are not ready to give our freedom to this [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2775.36s)]
*  Terrorist Putin. That's it. That's why we are fighting. That's it person Walker's like [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2780.8s)]
*  Come on pot said the world we won't keep you [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2788.6000000000004s)]
*  Slensky that interview came after Zelensky had to publicly rebuke his top general for saying the war had become a stalemate and [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2791.44s)]
*  Shortly after Zelensky fired his head of special operations forces this also [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2798.3999999999996s)]
*  You know this week coincided with considerable public anger at the Ukrainian military leadership [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2803.08s)]
*  Within Ukraine because 19 Ukrainian soldiers were killed by a Russian airstrike as they were all congregating together for a [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2808.52s)]
*  Medal award ceremony. They're all out in the open for too long and they got [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2815.72s)]
*  Targeted and it's a tragic mistake [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2819.6s)]
*  That's really created a huge controversy and then been over in Russia [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2821.9599999999996s)]
*  Putin side of law pulling Moscow out of the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2825.52s)]
*  This is largely a symbolic move [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2829.2799999999997s)]
*  But it is a reminder that the only nuclear arms control agreement still in place is the new START treaty [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2830.8799999999997s)]
*  So not great and then lastly the Wall Street Journal [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2836.08s)]
*  Reported that US intelligence agencies believe that the Wagner mercenary group is preparing to send air defense systems to Hezbollah [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2839.3999999999996s)]
*  That would be a hell of an escalation [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2845.56s)]
*  And you know again quite the middle finger to be being in Yahoo [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2847.8799999999997s)]
*  Because the Israelis very pointedly refused to provide missile defense systems to the Ukrainians and now you know Putin's [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2850.96s)]
*  Stooges over at the Wagner group are seemingly gonna help out a terrorist [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2858.48s)]
*  Targeting him so Ben, you know, look I get that Zelensky's audience in shooting down these sort of stalemate [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2861.96s)]
*  Observation is the US Congress, right? [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2869.44s)]
*  Because yes trying to help Biden get the supplemental through and get all the additional funding and weapons systems [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2871.96s)]
*  He needs to keep this war going but I mean if we're being honest it does seem like it's a stalemate, right? [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2877.4s)]
*  No, there's no question [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2883.56s)]
*  I mean [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2884.6400000000003s)]
*  I think that was one of those moments of candor where someone says something that everybody kind of feels to be true [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2884.88s)]
*  Right in the sense that the front line has only moved like a few miles over the course of this multi-month counteroffensive [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2889.92s)]
*  and I think that you put your finger on it that the reason that comment matters is [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2897.1200000000003s)]
*  The bulk of that supplemental is Ukraine funding because the administration is clearly trying to get the funding they need to get through the whole [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2903.44s)]
*  year to the election and [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2909.94s)]
*  The idea that it's a stalemate, you know, some Republicans will use that I'm sure to say [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2912.44s)]
*  Why are we pouring arms and tens of billions of dollars into a stalemate? [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2917.5600000000004s)]
*  and in that, you know the message that the Zelensky's trying to get across is [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2922.44s)]
*  You know look [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2927.1600000000003s)]
*  Hey, we need this just to stay alive, right? I mean, you know in other words like if the Ukrainians are cut off [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2928.84s)]
*  It's not just about whether or not there's stalemates whether or not Putin can make gains [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2935.2400000000002s)]
*  but also the special operations change indicates that they're [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2938.36s)]
*  Their strategy is shifting a bit from kind of pushing across this entire huge front line [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2942.28s)]
*  To maybe focusing on particular areas or maybe doing things behind enemy lines [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2947.96s)]
*  Through special operations or drones or other things but it's a reminder that like the even larger war that is taking place in Europe [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2953.7799999999997s)]
*  You know that there's not a clear endgame there either and so part of what is so uncertain right now is you've got these two wars [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2962.3399999999997s)]
*  You've got this massive supplemental bill and I don't think anybody could say clearly [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2969.2s)]
*  What what's the endgame in either Ukraine for Gaza and and I'm sure you know, that's beyond the control the White House [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2974.7s)]
*  Not even suggest and it's a challenge them. It's not their fault. That is what it is [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2980.6s)]
*  Yeah, let's let's hope that that wagon group transfer of the missile defense system to Hezbollah does not happen [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2984.68s)]
*  Although if it did and there's intelligence about it [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2990.08s)]
*  It's the kind of thing you can imagine the US or the Israelis taken out on the runway [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2992.44s)]
*  Yeah, well and part of what makes me so invisible, you know [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2996.2799999999997s)]
*  we haven't done World War watch on this podcast in a while because hey Phil because it's kind of evident but [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=2999.16s)]
*  That's when those two wars start to feel like the same conflict [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3004.7599999999998s)]
*  That's when you that's like when you your DEFCON alert, you know goes up a bit because it's like [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3009.44s)]
*  You know the Wagner group trying to transition [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3014.7799999999997s)]
*  Air defense systems to Hezbollah and Israel hitting that then suddenly this is kind of one theater, you know, and [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3019.0s)]
*  That's a little alarming not ideal [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3026.84s)]
*  You know, they're sort of major brewing issue as we're all focused on on Gaza and Israel is over in Pakistan [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3028.84s)]
*  Where hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees are being forced to leave the country [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3034.52s)]
*  This is part of Pakistan's repatriation plan that aims to remove undocumented people from the country [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3038.44s)]
*  November 1st was the deadline that the interim Pakistani government gave for people without legal documents to either leave voluntarily or face arrest or deportation [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3043.84s)]
*  The authorities have been going door-to-door to check migrants documentation and possibly push them out of the country [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3051.76s)]
*  There's about 4 million Afghans living in Pakistan and about 1.7 million of those people are expected to be affected by this policy [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3057.7000000000003s)]
*  Many of whom are the children of refugees? [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3064.76s)]
*  Whose parents fled fighting in previous conflicts and so these these kids have never actually lived in Afghanistan [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3067.6s)]
*  But are being forced to go back there [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3073.36s)]
*  Pakistan's government says deportations are necessary because 14 out of 24 major terrorist attacks this year were carried out by Afghan nationals [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3075.8s)]
*  They are concerned the the broader relationship between Afghanistan and Pakistan has been deteriorating [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3083.92s)]
*  Pakistani officials accused Afghanistan of providing a safe haven for the terrorist group TTP [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3089.56s)]
*  What an irony man? I literally like oh my god pressing irony and role reversal there [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3095.3199999999997s)]
*  So again regardless of why these deportations are happening this outcome is catastrophic for the people involved [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3099.92s)]
*  Many folks are getting you know forcibly pushed out of their homes, you know a gunpoint [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3106.12s)]
*  They'll they've nothing but the clothes on their backs. They're gonna return to a country that is basically a failed state [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3111.2799999999997s)]
*  It's reeling from decades of conflicts natural disasters earthquakes like you name it. So I guess Ben [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3116.8s)]
*  I mean we want to dig into this deeper. Yeah [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3122.28s)]
*  down the road and talk to some of the folks being impacted but do you think there's any country or [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3125.2000000000003s)]
*  Political entity or any way to force the Pakistanis to stop with this plan or they just they're gonna do it [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3130.1200000000003s)]
*  I mean they seem pretty intent on doing it and the hypocrisy is extreme [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3135.36s)]
*  Giving the fact that they gave the Taliban a safe haven for all those years and you Taliban could not have won [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3140.52s)]
*  Won the war in Afghanistan the key without Pakistan giving them a safe haven and now they're shocked shocked that that's coming back to [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3146.04s)]
*  haunt them [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3153.48s)]
*  I do think look Pakistan gets a lot of international assistance [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3155.16s)]
*  They get it in terms of direct assistance to get it in terms of kind of financial assistance [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3158.56s)]
*  And I do just think there has to be an effort to leverage that to say, you know [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3164.64s)]
*  We're not we're gonna keep bailing Pakistan out [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3169.76s)]
*  If this is how they're gonna treat 1.7 million people [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3173.48s)]
*  Many of whom you know to use an analogy [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3176.92s)]
*  It's kind of like the dreamers here like they're people that are like, you know in their 30s and 40s and never really lived in [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3179.36s)]
*  Afghanistan, you know [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3184.12s)]
*  there has to be some way to [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3186.2000000000003s)]
*  to slow this down and to slow this role and to like [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3189.32s)]
*  And to try to at least [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3194.08s)]
*  Identify like a less [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3196.92s)]
*  Comprehensive and onerous deportation to just say 1.7 million people have to leave the country tomorrow [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3199.96s)]
*  Runs counter to kind of how the world is supposed to manage these things now [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3205.64s)]
*  I can hear the Pakistani argument like, you know, the US deports people and so I'm not suggesting there's no [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3208.72s)]
*  Basis for Pakistan saying like there needs to be documentation things like this. But what the way they're doing this is [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3215.7599999999998s)]
*  Makes no sense. It's [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3221.72s)]
*  Vindictive by the way, it's probably hurt Pakistan to I'm sure a lot of these people are in the Pakistani economy [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3223.72s)]
*  This is just a dumb policy [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3228.2s)]
*  And so I think in terms in addition to being a cruel one and so I do think there has to be you know in donor nations [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3229.52s)]
*  International institutions like the IMF that have supported Pakistan I think need to be raising this [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3236.0s)]
*  Because there is leverage here. It just has to be used. Yeah one final story before Ben's interview [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3241.4399999999996s)]
*  Listeners might know that the United Kingdom has set up this ongoing independent investigation into the government's handling of the covert 19 pandemic [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3247.84s)]
*  Good idea, but also is a doozy [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3255.68s)]
*  we should again we should dig into this more down the road because [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3258.52s)]
*  Boris Johnson is gonna testify at some point soon [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3261.2s)]
*  And in the meantime all of the whatsapp messages from these various officials are dribbling out including from Johnson his top aides in the way [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3263.4s)]
*  They talk about Boris Johnson and the way they talk about each other is [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3271.44s)]
*  Fucking believable. They think he's a blithering idiot. They hate his guts like top civil servants are [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3275.08s)]
*  Destroying him, you know in these messages. It's amazing. But then this revelation caught our eye today. This is from a witness statement [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3282.3999999999996s)]
*  A person said that at one point early in the pandemic [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3289.68s)]
*  Johnson quote suggested to senior civil servants and advisors that he wanted to be injected with kovat 19 on television [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3292.9199999999996s)]
*  To demonstrate to the public that it did not pose a threat. So that's Bojo for you [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3300.48s)]
*  Inject me. I mean we had inject me with bleach. I was gonna say I was [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3306.7999999999997s)]
*  Where I was gonna go with this because like action. I'm not entirely sure which of those is dumber [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3310.52s)]
*  Probably the bleaching a little bit. I mean, but like not that much because Boris Johnson almost died of kovat [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3316.12s)]
*  Remember he was like in the ICU, you know, they were making contingency planning for what to do when he died [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3321.2s)]
*  They were like deputizing people and thinking about a rollout strategy because you know what that that kind of demonstrates about Boris Johnson [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3325.44s)]
*  I think sometimes [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3331.36s)]
*  There's a sense that people act like dumb populists [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3333.36s)]
*  But they're actually like smart or sometimes Americans look at the Brits and they're like he speaks to the British accents [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3336.38s)]
*  He sounds kind of smart. Yep. It just demonstrates that the guys have a moron like he's just stupid, you know, and and actually no [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3341.7200000000003s)]
*  He's not some like, you know, like super [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3348.64s)]
*  Wow, maybe he's like the wizard of Oz behind the curtain. There's nothing behind the curtain [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3351.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean this guy is a guy that literally [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3354.8799999999997s)]
*  Despite having a bunch of risk factors. He's not that young and he's not that healthy looking no [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3357.72s)]
*  terrible hair, yeah, yeah, like I [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3362.7599999999998s)]
*  You know like this is not the smartest bulb in the in the light bulb [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3366.04s)]
*  He's a profoundly unserious person. Yeah, apparently he made the suggestion multiple times to different sets of civil servants [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3371.08s)]
*  And remember this is a guy who skipped like a bunch of the early [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3376.8799999999997s)]
*  Covid meetings because he was I think writing a book about Shakespeare or something like he was doing some grifting bullshit [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3380.16s)]
*  When he was supposed to be running the country, but it's a reminder that in his horrifying moment in like the world's history [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3385.7599999999998s)]
*  To the most powerful countries on earth were run by clowns any much a quick British point here [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3392.64s)]

*  The the nurses and doctors of the British National Service that have this lunatic leading them through this thing [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3416.48s)]
*  You know some Machiavellian advisors should be like, yeah, let's do it. Yeah. Yeah [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3421.32s)]
*  Maybe they did actually the guy did get Covid giddy up [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3425.28s)]
*  We don't know one quick note before we go to a break [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3427.96s)]

*  one person's story [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3675.06s)]
*  And I want you to describe how did you? [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3677.3399999999997s)]
*  Find like a deeper truth that you were looking for [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3680.66s)]
*  About the situation the West Bank about the occupation through this story [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3684.5s)]
*  What just walk people through who haven't read the book obviously a bit about the story you chose and what it illuminates [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3688.42s)]
*  So I tell the story of a tragic bus accident involving a group of Palestinian [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3693.6s)]
*  Kindergartners who? [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3699.94s)]
*  lived in the town of Anatta which is partially annexed by Israel annexed in [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3702.06s)]
*  1967 and partially unannexed and [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3709.46s)]
*  This is a town just outside [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3713.1s)]
*  of Jerusalem the part that's annexed is inside the municipal boundary of Jerusalem and [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3715.5s)]
*  That's the city I live in I would pass by this community [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3721.62s)]
*  nearly every day and [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3726.2999999999997s)]
*  The community is encircled by walls it has the 26 foot tall [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3728.3s)]
*  concrete wall of the separation barrier on three sides and on the fourth side is another kind of wall [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3736.0600000000004s)]
*  which is the wall that runs through route 4370 a [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3743.5800000000004s)]
*  segregated Road [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3748.3s)]
*  with Israeli traffic on one side Palestinian traffic on the other [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3749.86s)]
*  famously known as the apartheid Road and [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3754.26s)]
*  I would pass by this walled enclave and hardly pass it pay at any mind and [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3757.34s)]
*  after this accident occurred [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3765.5s)]
*  I couldn't stop thinking about the families that share the city with me and live a radically different life and [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3767.5s)]
*  I began to reach out to everyone involved in this accident [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3776.86s)]
*  Both Jews and Palestinians and I quickly realized that by telling the story of this accident [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3781.9s)]
*  I could in fact tell the whole story of Israel Palestine [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3788.1400000000003s)]
*  In microcosm, you know, it's called a day in the life of Abed Salama, but it's really [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3792.1800000000003s)]
*  about the entire life of Abed Salama and some of the other characters in the book and [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3797.58s)]
*  What I do is I follow Abed [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3804.34s)]
*  On the eve of the accident he takes his five-year-old son Milad to go buy treats for a kindergarten class trip and [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3807.62s)]
*  In this walled enclave, they have no playgrounds. The streets are [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3816.14s)]
*  Look like rubble. There is [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3823.2599999999998s)]
*  No lane in the main streets. It's barely wide enough for a car and a bus to pass one another [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3826.2999999999997s)]
*  This is a hundred thirty thousand people living in this tight dense urban ghetto [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3834.86s)]
*  Without a single ATM and even the emergency services [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3841.5s)]
*  Cannot enter without an army [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3847.2999999999997s)]
*  escort so this is an area of gross neglect and [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3850.62s)]
*  Because the members of this community have different statuses within Israel [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3855.42s)]
*  Some of them have green West Bank IDs that don't allow them to enter the rest of Jerusalem [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3860.7s)]
*  Some of them have blue Jerusalem IDs that do allow them to enter Jerusalem [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3866.2999999999997s)]
*  So this kindergarten class trip couldn't go to a nearby play area just on the other side of the wall [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3870.74s)]
*  for example in the settlement of Pizgat-se-Ev a stone's throw away and they had to follow the winding path of [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3876.22s)]
*  the wall to a play area on the outskirts of Ramallah and [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3884.2999999999997s)]
*  After they passed through a checkpoint they were struck by a giant [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3888.22s)]
*  Semi trailer that was going back and forth from a settlement quarry [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3893.2999999999997s)]
*  transporting stones to a factory in East Jerusalem that would [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3899.02s)]
*  help to pave the the roads inside Israel with the natural resources of the West Bank and [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3903.54s)]
*  The bus flipped over and caught fire [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3909.4199999999996s)]
*  six children died one teacher died and [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3913.14s)]
*  The people who were left to deal with the accident because the emergency services took so very long to come the first [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3917.06s)]
*  Israeli fire truck came over a half hour after the accident after all of the kids had been evacuated the kids who lived and [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3924.54s)]
*  the bystanders there were taking these soot-covered children off of the bus and [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3934.26s)]
*  They themselves had a mix of IDs green IDs and blue IDs [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3940.2200000000003s)]
*  so if you were a [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3944.2999999999997s)]
*  Palestinian bystander with a blue ID and somebody put a kindergartner in the back of your car [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3946.38s)]
*  you would drive to a superior Jerusalem hospital and [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3952.02s)]
*  Take the child there and if you had a green ID, you might go somewhere else like Ramallah and [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3956.46s)]
*  Abed when he hears about the accident he races to the scene [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3962.22s)]
*  He tries to flag down an Israeli Jeep an army Jeep [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3966.5s)]
*  To get a ride just a few minutes up the road to the accident site [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3972.3799999999997s)]
*  They refuse he gets there and other parents are already there and there's a crowd and he cannot see a single child [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3976.3799999999997s)]
*  From the accident and he asks people in the crowd [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3983.8999999999996s)]
*  You know, where are the children and they tell him, you know [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3987.8199999999997s)]
*  They're at a military base up the road a minute up the road. They're at an East Jerusalem Hospital [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3992.4199999999996s)]
*  They're at this West Jerusalem Hospital [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=3998.54s)]
*  They're in Ramallah. They're in Nablus and he himself Abed has a green West Bank ID [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4000.58s)]
*  He can't go to most of these places to look for his child. He can't go to an Israeli military base [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4006.34s)]
*  He can't enter East Jerusalem or West Jerusalem [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4012.94s)]
*  so he goes to [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4015.7s)]
*  Ramallah and he calls on a relative who has a blue ID to go look into in the Jerusalem hospitals for his son and [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4017.22s)]
*  It's more than 36 hours before he finds out the fate of his five-year-old boy and [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4024.62s)]
*  we follow Abed through those 36 hours, but the the [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4032.1s)]
*  theme of the book is really more than just Abed's personal quest but really how these [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4037.06s)]
*  Jewish and Palestinian characters live these separate and unequal lives in very close proximity [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4043.9399999999996s)]
*  And and and how those lives come into collision on the day of this tragedy [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4050.74s)]
*  People ask what why people use the word apartheid. I don't if people have a better word to describe what you just [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4057.2599999999998s)]

*  Want to ask you though, you know you you talk about the Jewish and Palestinian [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4068.5s)]
*  Perspective in your book. I think the impact on Palestinians is pretty clear from what you just said [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4073.2999999999997s)]
*  What do you think has been the impact of the occupation on Jewish Israelis [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4077.98s)]
*  How how does [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4084.98s)]
*  Having a policy like that [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4087.94s)]
*  affect a country like Israel. Well, I think that [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4090.2599999999998s)]
*  people live with a kind of [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4094.8599999999997s)]
*  internal [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4098.5s)]
*  Contradiction a deep internal contradiction. They're told [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4099.74s)]
*  On the one hand that we have the most moral army in the world and that our cause is [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4103.58s)]
*  Just and on the other they see the deep injustice that's [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4109.82s)]
*  Undeniable and that's excused in different ways. It's the situation that's lasted more than a half a century now is described as temporary [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4115.86s)]
*  there are many kinds of [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4123.179999999999s)]
*  Excuses that people make and there are talking points that people go to so I think that [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4125.74s)]
*  living with that situation and justifying it to yourself and [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4131.68s)]
*  Telling yourself that you are a democracy and that you are [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4136.68s)]
*  Moral and liberal. I think that that is a terrible contradiction for people to hold in their minds [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4141.48s)]
*  that [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4149.48s)]
*  Tortures them and what would you say to somebody, you know who might be listening this interview and thinking, you know [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4150.599999999999s)]
*  Maybe there's some people just don't want to hear this [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4156.76s)]
*  It's probably a lot of people and don't worry. We'll get to that [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4158.72s)]
*  I'm gonna ask you about the reaction to your book in a second here [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4161.84s)]
*  But which are people who will say, you know what I've heard and I'm sure you've heard even more than me [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4164.84s)]
*  Which is that it's the Palestinians fault. They wouldn't make peace [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4169.0s)]
*  They elected Hamas and Gaza. They have this bad leadership the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. They [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4173.12s)]
*  You know when we pulled that back from places we got rockets [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4181.64s)]
*  That this is necessary this system you described is necessary so as to ensure that Israeli civilians aren't threatened [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4185.56s)]
*  What is it? You've heard all that what would be your answer to that that listeners who's probably thinking those things right now? [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4194.4800000000005s)]
*  So I think that you know, the fundamental issue [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4200.4400000000005s)]
*  is [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4205.12s)]
*  one of historical understanding and of framing and [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4206.6s)]
*  I think that for the vast majority of Israelis including the in particular this is less true of the Israeli right actually [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4210.84s)]
*  But the Israelis of the center at center left and most people in the US and certainly most US officials [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4218.679999999999s)]
*  Is a their framing of the conflict is a [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4225.84s)]
*  1967 framing there they basically believe that the [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4230.24s)]
*  Primary issue to be resolved is the occupation of Gaza and the West Bank and East Jerusalem that began in [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4235.12s)]
*  1967 and for Palestinians [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4242.36s)]
*  The occupation is the most egregious [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4245.72s)]
*  form of [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4249.36s)]
*  Oppression that they face today, but it is not the primary or sole issue that the conflict is about [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4250.84s)]
*  It is about [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4258.679999999999s)]
*  Zionism it is about a political ideology that began in [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4261.64s)]
*  putting Jews [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4266.320000000001s)]
*  settling Jews inside historic Palestine in 1882 at a time when the Jewish population was [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4267.92s)]
*  roughly five percent of [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4275.52s)]
*  historic Palestine and having a project to establish a Jewish homeland [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4277.84s)]
*  against the will of the native majority and that [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4283.76s)]
*  culminated in 1948 and the mass expulsion [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4287.280000000001s)]
*  and flight of [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4290.68s)]
*  750,000 Palestinians we're talking about within the territory of what became Israel [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4294.08s)]
*  78% of historic Palestine or came out 80% of the [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4300.4400000000005s)]
*  population is removed and overnight a [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4305.280000000001s)]
*  Palestinian majority was turned into a minority and they were not [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4308.68s)]
*  After the armistice agreements were drawn up. They were not allowed to return [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4313.360000000001s)]
*  That's what the conflict is primarily about for Palestinians and I think that at [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4317.72s)]
*  At the most basic level that is the cause of this huge [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4325.0s)]
*  perception gap between [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4331.68s)]
*  Palestinians and their allies and [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4334.92s)]
*  Israelis and their allies over [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4337.96s)]
*  What is a fair deal and who's at fault for there not having been a deal? [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4340.96s)]
*  Until now that's very useful context and you know further concessions, right? [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4347.08s)]
*  We're envisioned the demilitarization of any Palestinian state that kind of long-term Israeli military presence in the West Bank [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4353.56s)]
*  People should get a sense of just how? [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4361.04s)]
*  How far that the line continues to move even in more recent negotiations? I want to ask you obviously about the current situation [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4363.24s)]
*  And before again getting to the reaction your book [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4371.2s)]
*  You know, we've been talking a lot about Gaza and one of the reasons why I want to talk to you is you've obviously [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4374.2s)]
*  focused a lot on the West Bank [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4378.0s)]
*  and [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4380.08s)]
*  And the West Bank hasn't got as much attention recently, but there's been a huge uptick in violence in the West Bank [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4381.08s)]
*  We've had according to estimates at least 155 Palestinians killed in the West Bank since October 7th [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4386.599999999999s)]
*  Some of that by kind of Israeli settler violence kind of [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4392.959999999999s)]
*  vigilante type violence [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4396.759999999999s)]
*  What is your sense of the current situation in the West Bank and and what should people be looking for as the world's attention is [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4399.12s)]
*  On Gaza in terms of the potential for things to escalate in the West Bank. So [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4405.4400000000005s)]
*  while all eyes are on Gaza, it is an opportunity for [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4409.84s)]
*  Far-right settlers and settler militias to advance their old project of [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4416.4800000000005s)]
*  dispossessing [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4424.12s)]
*  Palestinians and [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4425.76s)]
*  We were already prior to October 7th looking at a situation of [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4428.12s)]
*  Record levels of displacement by settler militias in the West Bank from the beginning of 2022 [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4435.08s)]
*  until [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4441.64s)]
*  September when the UN issued a report saying that over [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4443.6s)]
*  1,100 Palestinians had been forcibly displaced in the West Bank in that period [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4449.08s)]
*  This is a level of displacement we had not seen in decades [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4453.88s)]
*  Just since October 7th an additional eight hundred [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4457.88s)]
*  People have been forcibly displaced largely by settler militias [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4462.64s)]
*  Palestinians entire communities removed the many articles in the press describing this as ethnic cleansing. So [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4467.76s)]
*  that is one of the main things that we should be looking at in the West Bank and the [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4476.76s)]
*  Other thing that we should be looking at is the potential for a [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4481.5199999999995s)]
*  collapse of the Palestinian Authority on the first [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4486.8s)]
*  Weekend after the October 7th attack. We saw mass [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4491.8s)]
*  protests in city centers in the West Bank clashes between [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4496.679999999999s)]
*  Palestinians and the Palestinian Authority, which is perceived as [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4501.0s)]
*  working hand-in-glove with Israel to [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4507.2s)]
*  solidify Israel's control and [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4511.88s)]
*  perpetuate the occupation and [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4514.48s)]
*  I have never seen prior to those images. I had never seen [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4516.719999999999s)]
*  anything that looked more like the beginning of the end of the PA and [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4522.639999999999s)]
*  We haven't seen something on that scale since but this is all very fresh and it's quite possible that we are going to see major [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4528.24s)]
*  disruption [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4537.679999999999s)]
*  And political collapse in the West Bank. Yeah, which would lead to a very volatile situation, right? Because you saw millions of Palestinians there and [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4538.92s)]
*  They'd lose all governing authority and and you've had settler militias unleashed it could get a lot worse there [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4546.0s)]
*  I want to ask about your book. So it comes out right before October 7th [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4551.76s)]
*  You told the Washington Post that you estimated that a quarter of your appearances [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4557.04s)]
*  Were canceled in terms of like your book tour mainly in the United States, but also in Europe, I think [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4561.24s)]
*  And that's run the gamut from you know [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4566.400000000001s)]
*  Arkansas having laws against BDS and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, you know [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4569.16s)]
*  condemning you and [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4574.12s)]
*  But even seemingly well-meaning people saying it's just not the time to have a conversation about this book because we're focused on [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4575.4400000000005s)]
*  What happened? I mean [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4581.200000000001s)]
*  What do you think how do you how do you react to? [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4583.280000000001s)]
*  The cancellations of your these types of events. What do you just say some of those audiences here? [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4587.4800000000005s)]
*  The Jewish American audiences it might be very interested in the store in your book and some of the the issues around the occupation [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4593.08s)]
*  But who felt after October 7th, I don't want to engage with that because I'm just feeling solidarity [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4599.72s)]
*  And I don't want to signal that I'm somehow not fully behind Israel in this moment [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4604.8s)]
*  I mean, how do you unpack that in your own experience and for other people? So there have been [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4608.52s)]
*  an array of reasons that [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4613.76s)]
*  different events of mine have been cancelled and [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4617.48s)]
*  Some of them have been [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4620.24s)]
*  You know by the UK police canceling of you know, 400 seat event in London [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4623.24s)]
*  citing [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4629.0s)]
*  public safety [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4630.2s)]
*  Others have been an entire conference of Palestinian Americans whose conference in Houston was shut down [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4631.4s)]
*  The pressure was put by a pro-israel organization on the Hilton hotel to cancel the conference and that was cancelled [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4639.36s)]
*  And others have been as you say [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4646.599999999999s)]
*  You know Jewish groups who for example progressive synagogue in New York that told me now is not the time [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4649.12s)]
*  You know our people are grieving and they're not prepared to [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4655.799999999999s)]
*  You know hear a story about occupation right now and and my response to them has been first of all [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4660.2s)]
*  I've spoken to many Jewish audiences since October 7th [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4667.32s)]
*  Those talks have all gone very well people have been going through a lot of trouble [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4671.12s)]
*  People have been grateful for it [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4675.56s)]
*  there's a way to talk about these issues with sensitivity and [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4677.8s)]
*  Acknowledgement of the terrible grief that Israelis and Jews are feeling after October 7th [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4682.8s)]
*  while also acknowledging the grief of Palestinians who [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4689.200000000001s)]
*  You know are mourning the loss of more than 4,000 children as as we speak today [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4694.400000000001s)]
*  And I've told them that not only have those events gone well and have the people been grateful to have this conversation [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4700.92s)]
*  But there has never been a more necessary [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4708.72s)]
*  and urgent [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4711.72s)]
*  Time to have these conversations [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4713.52s)]
*  we have seen round after round of bloodshed in Gaza and [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4716.24s)]
*  When that bloodshed occurs everybody says let's have calm [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4721.8s)]
*  Now this book is about calm this book is about what that quote-unquote [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4726.92s)]
*  calm looks like that calm isn't calm that calm is violent and it's oppressive and it leads to [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4732.5599999999995s)]
*  violence in reaction to it and [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4739.8s)]
*  unless we do more than call for calm unless we actually look at this system of [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4743.32s)]
*  7 million Jews [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4749.92s)]
*  7 million Palestinians all living under Israeli control the vast majority of those Palestinians living without basic civil rights [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4751.52s)]
*  Unless we address that and talk about it and think about how we're going to end that system [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4760.6s)]
*  We are doomed to see more and more of this bloodshed which I think all of the audience that I'm speaking to [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4766.68s)]
*  Want to see come to an end. Yeah. Well, that's [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4775.84s)]
*  another [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4780.120000000001s)]
*  Conversation for another time will be potential solutions in the back end of this. I want to ask you one last question [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4781.56s)]
*  You know you've become friends with Abed Salama through this through telling his story and his family story [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4787.72s)]
*  The tragic loss of his child and what it illuminates you also were traveling together [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4793.280000000001s)]
*  For this book tour when October 7th happened in the days after I'm just wondering what that was like [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4799.280000000001s)]
*  For you to be with this Palestinian whose story you've so deeply embedded through this [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4805.9s)]
*  horrific attack by Hamas and then through the [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4813.0599999999995s)]
*  Israeli strikes on Gaza what what was that like and what is that was that experience like for him? So [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4815.42s)]
*  It was extremely difficult for him to be away from his family [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4821.42s)]
*  during this time of war and he had to cut our book tour short because of [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4826.94s)]
*  The situation in the West Bank it really feels like the second Intifada right now entire communities are shut down [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4832.62s)]
*  Mobility is greatly restricted in Abed's community of Anatta after October 7th. They shut down the two exits [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4841.78s)]
*  There's one exit toward the rest of Jerusalem for those with blue IDs one exit at the bottom for people with both green and blue [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4848.98s)]
*  IDs and it just takes you know four soldiers to put down a gate or put up a couple roadblocks [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4856.0199999999995s)]
*  And they can shut down a hundred and thirty thousand people. It's like that all over the West Bank [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4861.86s)]
*  You know every Palestinian family is relying on [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4867.82s)]
*  higher paying jobs in Israel and the settlements and those jobs don't exist right now and [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4872.0199999999995s)]
*  Even Abed's son who works in Ramallah was told by his employer in Ramallah don't come because of all of the settler violence [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4879.0599999999995s)]
*  It's not safe on the roads. So [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4886.78s)]
*  he there is a [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4889.62s)]
*  situation of extreme violence right now and [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4892.78s)]
*  Economic constriction [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4898.82s)]
*  Abed's wife's cousin was just killed in al-bire while driving his car when Israel was doing a military [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4900.74s)]
*  operation to arrest some people there [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4908.179999999999s)]
*  And he just felt that he couldn't be away from his family [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4911.139999999999s)]
*  but prior to that when we were together and processing October 7th and [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4915.179999999999s)]
*  Watching the war unfold in Gaza, you know it it was [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4920.9400000000005s)]
*  for me [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4926.86s)]
*  You know an experience of us of us bonding even more over our shared [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4928.42s)]
*  horror at the killing of civilians [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4933.86s)]
*  and our [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4937.22s)]
*  joint, you know condemnation of of war crimes [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4938.62s)]
*  No matter who who commits them. And so I was I [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4943.22s)]
*  Never had any doubts that Abed and I saw eye to eye on that and and I was [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4947.860000000001s)]
*  You know grateful actually to be with him as as we were watching all of this unfold well look [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4954.14s)]
*  People should definitely check out the book [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4961.3s)]
*  It's an extraordinary window into daily life [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4963.34s)]
*  It's also just a profoundly human story a day in the life of Abed Salama. It reminds us that if you actually [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4966.860000000001s)]
*  put aside [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4972.22s)]
*  rationalization and [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4973.820000000001s)]
*  Competitive grievance and just focus on new humanity of the people involved in this things become a lot clearer [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVPU3ITnq-A&t=4975.22s)]
