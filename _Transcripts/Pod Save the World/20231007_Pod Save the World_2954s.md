# BREAKING: Israel Is At War Following Deadly Hamas Terrorist Attacks
**Pod Save the World:** [October 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY)
*  Welcome back to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Ben Rhodes and Ben and I we're hosting a special episode of Pod Save the World today on Saturday October 7th [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=0.0s)]
*  Following the news of this war breaking out between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza. So this is a developing situation [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=9.84s)]
*  We're recording at about three o'clock [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=16.88s)]
*  Pacific time Saturday because we just wanted to get you guys sort of the best information as we know it [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=19.56s)]
*  But you know Ben so far this is pretty horrifying [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=25.6s)]
*  Events and scenes coming out of Israel so far. Yeah, kind of a worst-case scenario situation Tommy. I really don't [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=28.96s)]
*  Look forward at all to the coming days here. Yeah, absolutely [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=34.72s)]
*  So what we know so far is that on the morning of October 7th [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=38.36s)]
*  There was a coordinated assault launched by Hamas on several different parts of Israel [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=42.28s)]
*  There were an estimated 2000 rockets fired those rained down from the sky and seemed to get through [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=47.64s)]
*  Some of the Israeli missile defense systems that had usually been a lot more capable at the same time militants entered more than 20 [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=53.559999999999995s)]
*  southern Israeli towns [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=61.16s)]
*  Killing and kidnapping civilians and soldiers. They reportedly took over an IDF headquarters that was in charge of military operations [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=63.16s)]
*  for Gaza for something like 12 or 13 hours [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=71.56s)]
*  These Hamas fighters they used explosives to break through the border fence. They crossed with motorcycles pickup trucks [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=75.24s)]
*  There were literally guys on hang gliders [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=81.72s)]
*  There were speedboats on the coast and these gun clashes the fighting is ongoing. There's hostage situations that are ongoing [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=84.96s)]
*  There are you know, this is all over social media. Of course, there's scenes of streets littered with bodies [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=93.56s)]
*  Hamas militants going house to house seemingly unopposed [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=100.12s)]
*  There are you know footage of Israeli soldiers being pulled out of a tank and taken hostage [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=103.92s)]
*  There's civilians being taken hostage. It's the worst situation imaginable [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=109.39999999999999s)]
*  Israel's wasted no time retaliating. They're launching airstrikes into Gaza [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=114.83999999999999s)]
*  There's videos already coming out of high-rise buildings being leveled [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  so according to Israeli officials the estimated death toll at the moment is [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=122.6s)]
*  250 Israelis killed and more than 1450 wounded. There's also an estimated 50 Israelis who have been taken hostage [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=127.88s)]
*  Again these were these numbers are going to go up and up unfortunately [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=135.76000000000002s)]
*  But the current estimates is that 234 Palestinians have been killed [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=139.32s)]
*  And at least 1600 civilians have been wounded in the gun battles or airstrikes and again the sort of [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=143.8s)]
*  Response from the IDF has just begun. So that number is going to go way up [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu said we are at war and he has told [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  Palestinian civilians to leave Gaza now because the Israeli military is going to quote turn all Hamas high-rise buildings [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  hiding places into rubble then no explanation from Netanyahu for how exactly [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=165.4s)]
*  Civilians are supposed to get out of Gaza given that there's a blockade [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=171.32s)]
*  You know the border with Egypt is closed, but you know there are videos currently of Israeli tanks heading south [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=174.48s)]
*  Towards the Gaza Strip, and it seems like a ground invasion could be imminent so Ben [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=181.76s)]
*  I mean the the comparison you're seeing a lot right now is that this is Israel's [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=186.5s)]
*  Equivalent of the 9-eleven attacks for us. I'm wondering if you agree and any sort of other first thoughts on what's been happening [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=192.06s)]
*  well, you know, I I guess [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=198.66s)]
*  It's not like 9-eleven in the sense that [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=201.46s)]
*  9-eleven to most Americans kind of came out of nowhere, right whereas [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=204.82s)]
*  This is the fifth Gaza war we've now seen since 2007 [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=209.78s)]
*  But it is like 9-eleven in terms of the scale of the loss [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=214.1s)]
*  You know per capita in Israel [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=219.54s)]
*  It's probably greater than 9-eleven and also in terms of the surprise at the complexity of the attack [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=221.26s)]
*  Just like Americans were surprised by the complexity 9-eleven attack. I think what stands out to me here [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=226.34s)]
*  First something on the attack and then on the timing of it. I mean, we've just never seen Hamas do anything like this [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=231.85999999999999s)]
*  We've seen them launch rockets into Israel. We've seen them, you know kidnap an Israeli soldier and galad shalit a few years ago [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=238.1s)]
*  We've seen them kind of launch [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=246.01999999999998s)]
*  Discrete attacks but to have this kind of multifaceted complex land air and sea invasion essentially of Israel is [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=248.62s)]
*  totally unprecedented and [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=256.3s)]
*  Would suggest months and months and months of planning that had to go into this and that there was clearly some degree of intelligence [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=258.14s)]
*  Failure in Israel which we can talk about. I mean that the failure to understand what Hamas was doing [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=264.7s)]
*  And the failure to have military resources in place to deal with that now part of the reason for that [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=270.58s)]
*  Is a lot of Israeli military resources it might be in the south. We're up dealing with [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=275.58s)]
*  protecting settlers who engaged in [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=280.54s)]
*  Tit-for-tat violence of Palestinians in the West Bank. So that that factors into it here, too [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=282.62s)]
*  I think the timing is is an interesting question. I think there are a few different possibilities here only Hamas knows [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=286.54s)]
*  The true answer. I mean one is it was the 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur war [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=293.1s)]
*  1973 when there was a surprise attract on on Israel from Arab states [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=297.65999999999997s)]
*  Second the Palestinian leadership is very weak. The Palestinian Authority is very weak. Probably the weakest they've ever been [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=303.02000000000004s)]
*  There's this kind of school radical man and Abu Mazen in charge of it [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=309.22s)]
*  They're not doing anything to advance Palestinian statehood. And so Hamas is also I think potentially making a bid here for [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=312.90000000000003s)]
*  You know really [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=320.06s)]
*  Establishing themselves at the vanguard of the Palestinians [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=321.5s)]
*  I do think that the far-right nature of the Israeli government, you know [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=324.70000000000005s)]
*  Hamas may have been looking at this and thinking not only are these people not at all interested in a political process [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=328.22s)]
*  But they seem divided at home. They seem perhaps focused on their own [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=333.14000000000004s)]
*  Democratic dysfunction that may have played into their calculus and then also the normalization that we've talked about [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=339.3s)]
*  Whether or not that was some asses intent [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=345.18s)]
*  It's certainly the reality that it's gonna be very hard for Saudi Arabia to conclude a normalization agreement with Israel [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=346.94000000000005s)]
*  After Israel does what it's likely to do in the coming days, which is gonna be I think probably a catastrophic [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=352.74s)]
*  humanitarian outcome for the Palestinians so a lot of reasons why [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=358.94s)]
*  You know, we've talked a lot in recent months about the desperation [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=362.94s)]
*  The growing violence the growing kind of far-right nature the Israeli government and obviously Hamas [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=367.02s)]
*  like a much more radical [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=373.53999999999996s)]
*  version of the Palestinian leadership than the Palestinian Authority [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=376.5s)]
*  The tinderbox has exploded here and I think we're just at the beginning of what's gonna be very complicated and tragic [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=379.22s)]
*  Series of weeks if not months. Yeah, and just one thing to add to this or why now question [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=387.9s)]
*  Which is that I've read somewhere a Hamas spokesperson saying, you know, this is retaliation for Israeli provocations at the al-Aqsa mosque again [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=392.7s)]
*  I I'm much more with you that only Hamas knows [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=400.62s)]
*  It's probably a whole bunch of different factors playing into what's happening right now including frankly perceived weakness [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=403.78000000000003s)]
*  among the Israeli military potentially and the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=411.38s)]
*  Israeli political establishment given all you know, the judicial coup that BB den Yahu's launched the ongoing protests [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=416.06s)]
*  I mean there have been lots and lots of reports warning after warning after warning from senior military and intelligence leaders about [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=423.5s)]
*  Their concern not only about military readiness and cohesion but about the perception of [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=430.5s)]
*  Israel's strength in the face of all this protests and dysfunction and [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=436.74s)]
*  What's been happening? But Ben, you know that you talked about this intelligence failure question [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=441.62s)]
*  I mean that is the number one question because Israel is known as having an incredibly capable military [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=445.66s)]
*  The Israeli intelligence services are considered some of the best in the world [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=451.18s)]
*  I mean they like us spend billions of dollars per year on signals intelligence collection spy satellites [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=454.5s)]
*  sensors cameras all around the border of Israel and I think most people assume that [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=460.42s)]
*  The Mossad head sources deep within Hamas deep within Hezbollah and other militant groups and yet as you pointed out like this [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=467.14s)]
*  Was not an isolated attack. This was a massive [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=474.3s)]
*  Coordinated assaults where I assume hundreds of militants [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=478.3s)]
*  We don't really know but they hit 22 different towns guys on hang gliders. I mean that require that naval assaults requires some incredibly [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=481.5s)]
*  Sophisticated planning and again, but like the hang gliders are these are based on videos [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=489.7s)]
*  We're all seeing on social media the naval assault the same way. So it's still hard to figure out [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=494.34s)]
*  What exactly is real and not and there's lots of different disinformation going around [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=499.38s)]
*  But I guess the Israeli government has already announced obviously they're gonna launch a major investigation into how it's possible [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=503.06s)]
*  They could have missed something like this [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=510.34s)]
*  but I'm wondering if you think there's a takeaway from an intelligence failure of this magnitude and sort of what it says about a [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=512.64s)]
*  Conflict like this you're right that I think it's gonna come out and it's certainly been the case that the military and the intelligence [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=518.9399999999999s)]
*  Community Israel has been warning and this isn't just us saying this [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=525.4599999999999s)]
*  I mean they have been warning that these divisions at home and [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=529.54s)]
*  The divisions in Israeli society and the kind of divisions between the civilian leadership and the military did put them at risk [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=533.5799999999999s)]
*  But even with those general warnings, they they clearly lacked specific intelligence and to put this into perspective [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=540.14s)]
*  Israel controls the entire internet access in Gaza. You cannot communicate on the internet in Gaza [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=548.3s)]
*  without interacting with Israeli technology and so [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=555.18s)]
*  Clearly in order to prepare hundreds of people to act in a coordinated way, right? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=558.4599999999999s)]
*  People have to fire these rockets people have to smash those barriers people have to get in the hang gliders [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=562.9s)]
*  Like people have to go out to sea [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=567.5799999999999s)]
*  To do that to attack 22 different sites inside of Israel towns settlements [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=569.62s)]
*  That requires, you know pretty sophisticated either counter surveillance [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=575.7s)]
*  Technology or maybe they threw you know, the Israel at the scent that is an intelligence fair. I do think look Hamas [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=580.66s)]
*  We're gonna have to say this probably a few times [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=588.38s)]
*  But Hamas is entirely responsible for a horrific loss of life that has no justification [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=590.36s)]
*  I [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=596.58s)]
*  Think though with Israeli intelligence failure. It's not just a failure of intelligence [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=598.02s)]
*  It's a failure of their entire Gaza policy because their entire Gaza policy policy is based on the premise [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=602.3s)]
*  That if you blockade this place and you squeeze it and you surveil it that you can get security and Netanyahu's [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=607.78s)]
*  Nickname was mr. Security and his argument was always I may be you know at times brutal with the Palestinians [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=614.38s)]
*  I may have all these security barriers and I may risk isolation from some countries because of how I treat Gaza [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=619.78s)]
*  But the trade-off is you get to be safe inside of Israel and and this is kind of certainly undermined that argument [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=625.18s)]
*  You know, I think it just demonstrates that the whole policy was vulnerable to this kind of attack as it built up [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=632.12s)]
*  Palestinian grievance and as the Hamas was built up its capabilities [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=639.36s)]
*  I do think unfortunately the Israeli response is likely going to be therefore. We just kind of need to flatten [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=643.8000000000001s)]
*  Gaza we need to destroy Hamas, you know not leave anything behind and and that's why I think this could be a really brutal [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=650.08s)]
*  I mean particularly if there are all these people who have taken been taken hostage [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=656.48s)]
*  You know, there will be a ground invasion of Gaza and we've seen in the past [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=659.96s)]
*  That's where the casualty numbers go way way up among civilians who are densely densely packed in there amidst [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=663.16s)]
*  Where Hamas targets are amidst where now Israeli hostages are so this has the potential [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=668.84s)]
*  To be much much worse than even the four Gaza wars we've seen [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=675.28s)]
*  Up to this point. Yeah, I mean look we'll get into what comes next in a second [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=680.6s)]
*  But you know, there's reports, you know, the Israeli military is not ruling [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=684.74s)]
*  Reoccupying Gaza, you know, they're not taking that off the table [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=689.6s)]
*  There's reports that Israel has cut off all power to the Gaza Strip [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=692.8000000000001s)]
*  So like drastic actions already being taken, but let's first talk about the the White House response Ben because obviously, you know [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=696.84s)]
*  When we were in government, I mean, I'm sure people were basically sleeping at the White House last night sort of monitoring [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=703.2s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=707.48s)]
*  President Biden [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=708.6800000000001s)]
*  Was at the White House. He didn't go home to Wilmington. He didn't go to Camp David this weekend [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=710.6800000000001s)]
*  He stuck around presumably to deal with this and he gave a speech on Saturday afternoon [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=714.64s)]
*  Talking about a call. He had just made to Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu. Let's play a clip of that [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=720.0799999999999s)]
*  You know when I spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu this morning [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=725.0799999999999s)]
*  I told him the United States stands with the people of Israel in the face of these terrorist assaults [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=728.12s)]
*  Israel has the right to defend itself and its people full stop [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=734.16s)]
*  There's never justification for terrorist attacks and my administration support for Israel's security [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=739.0799999999999s)]
*  Is rock solid and unwavering. So Ben there's reports during that call that that Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=744.56s)]
*  Netanyahu asked Biden for [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=750.96s)]
*  Emergency funding for the purchase of more interceptors for the Iron Dome missile defense system [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=753.6s)]
*  The Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said the Pentagon is going to work to give Israel whatever they need to defend themselves [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=757.64s)]
*  You know Alexandra from the crooked media [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=764.8s)]
*  Pots of the world discord we asked some of our discord users for questions to help us to sketch out this episode [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=768.4s)]
*  They sent in some great questions [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=773.56s)]
*  Alexandra asked what do you think about the response from Biden other officials? What was missing? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=775.5999999999999s)]
*  What would you guys do to respond if you were still working for the administration? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=778.92s)]
*  So I mean, I look I think the first point is, you know, Israel just suffered this horrific [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=783.16s)]
*  Terrorist attack, you know hundreds of people are dead and all these hostages are missing [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=790.1999999999999s)]
*  I think this is exactly the tone I would have expected out of Biden or President Obama really any other president in a moment [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=793.8399999999999s)]
*  Like this to express solidarity to pledge unwavering support [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=799.9s)]
*  And basically said Bibi I got your back, you know help you sort of fight back against terrorists [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=803.8s)]
*  I wonder if I I hope then that in the private messages on the phone call [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=808.4s)]
*  Biden is also [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=814.52s)]
*  counseling restraint [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=816.38s)]
*  And hoping that Netanyahu doesn't rush a response or sense a massive ground evasion because of the casualty concerns [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=818.4s)]
*  That you just referenced but I was wondering what you made a Biden speech [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=825.3199999999999s)]
*  And what else you might have wanted him to say? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=828.56s)]
*  I mean, I think it's exactly what you expect like you said [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=830.9s)]
*  And and I think look in terms of the policy response [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=834.82s)]
*  You know, the immediate effort is to call if you're in the White House right now. You're drafting those statements. You're [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=838.82s)]
*  Looking at those requests for additional Iron Dome [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=846.5s)]
*  Support there's obviously a lot of incoming rockets is Ross enough to deal with that [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=849.78s)]
*  What's clearly happened though is that when you fire so many rockets you kind of overwhelm the system [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=855.62s)]
*  Never mind the fact that the system itself can't defend against like dudes, you know hang gliding into Israel [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=859.88s)]
*  But still they'll be diminishing those stockpiles of willing to be replenished the US has I think some pre-positioned [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=865.32s)]
*  military reserve equipment in Israel that can be used [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=871.36s)]
*  Israel may request additional support. I think Israel will importantly want intelligence support [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=874.96s)]
*  For trying to identify what can wear these hostages are maybe to try to look at whether there was any [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=880.64s)]
*  Iranian support or Hezbollah support for this but in terms of the rhetoric [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=886.76s)]
*  the Biden statements familiar and I think part of what is [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=891.9599999999999s)]
*  Unsatisfying about it that I don't again. This is not to single out Biden because what I'm about to say is it that language sounds [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=895.72s)]
*  So familiar, you know [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=902.16s)]
*  Obama said stuff like that, you know Trump in his own way said stuff like that George W Bush said stuff like that [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=904.72s)]
*  Part of what's missing here and I I don't expect it in the first day [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=911.52s)]
*  But to your point, I think over time what's what's clearly broken down here is the status quo and the status quo is [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=915.34s)]
*  You know, you ignore the Palestinians [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=922.62s)]
*  You normalize relations with the other Arab states, particularly the oil rich Gulf states [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=925.46s)]
*  And you just kind of ignore this issue [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=930.86s)]
*  You maybe engage in like diplomacy with Mahmoud Abbas who's like, you know [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=932.7800000000001s)]
*  A million years old and has no credibility to the Palestinians like that's not working [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=937.82s)]
*  And it's been obvious that that hasn't been working for a while and I think a certain point like the language has to change to some [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=942.78s)]
*  description of what where is this going with the Palestinians like that this [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=949.38s)]
*  We're about to have a major war here probably [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=954.74s)]
*  That's gonna kill a lot of people Israelis and Palestinians tragically [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=957.6999999999999s)]
*  But I think you know, you don't you want to keep it from escalating [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=962.78s)]
*  So you want to keep this from being a regional war like I know if Israel is gonna be considering attacks on Iran [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=966.5s)]
*  I know if his was me considering getting involved the US is gonna want to prevent I think that kind of regional escalation [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=971.7s)]
*  To your point, I think you know, I hope that we're counseling restraint in terms of the kind of wholesale targeting of Palestinian civilian targets [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=977.34s)]
*  But I'm not sure how influential we're gonna be in the coming days given the mood in you know in Israel in the nature of this [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=985.1400000000001s)]
*  government [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=990.98s)]
*  But I just think at some point, you know, we have to break out of the [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=992.0600000000001s)]
*  Conventional language on this thing and find a new way of talking about and diplomatically approaching [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=996.46s)]
*  The Palestinian issue, you know that brings in these regional countries because this [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1001.74s)]
*  This unfortunately is just not a sustainable status quo anymore [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1007.0600000000001s)]
*  Yeah [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1010.38s)]
*  I mean [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1010.86s)]
*  I think the Biden administration has a very clear record and I think they've basically set it on the record that they think the way [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1011.1s)]
*  That they get BB Net and Yahoo to do things is not to publicly [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1016.62s)]
*  Criticize him or tell him what to do what to do it all behind the scenes with this quiet intensive diplomacy [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1020.58s)]
*  You and I I think in the past have expressed our disagreement with that approach as a general matter [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1025.6200000000001s)]
*  Though I do think in this moment that the the day of when a terrorist attack is ongoing is probably [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1030.34s)]
*  The least effective moment for that kind of public messaging you have to you're probably gonna be more effective privately [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1038.34s)]
*  So I understand it. It is interesting though how much politics in Israel are in flux right now [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1043.3s)]
*  I mean we've talked for months and months and months about how [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1048.26s)]
*  BB Net Yahoo is only the prime minister because he assembled the most far-right coalition in Israeli history with [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1051.1399999999999s)]
*  Lawmakers who were considered completely out of bounds because they were right-wing because they supported, you know [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1058.6200000000001s)]
*  It's basically terrorist attack against Palestinian communities [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1064.3400000000001s)]
*  Net and Yahoo has been battling, you know through this judicial reform judicial coup someone call it effort [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1068.02s)]
*  And been in in real trouble. You know, so is corruption corruption cases that are ongoing [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1074.8600000000001s)]
*  But today it looks like members of the opposition [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1079.54s)]
*  leaders like Yair Lapid and Benny Gantz [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1083.66s)]
*  Have expressed willingness to come back into government for a sort of larger unity government with Net [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1086.58s)]
*  Yahoo, if Net and Yahoo will agree to remove some of the most you know [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1093.78s)]
*  Disgusting right-wing ministers guys like it tomorrow Ben Gavir [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1100.26s)]
*  This there's sort of some some history to an approach like this a bunch of opposition leaders joined the government before the 1967 war [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1103.9s)]
*  Then what I mean, I know it's really early to tell was wondering what you made of [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1111.7s)]
*  Lapid and Benny Gantz making this announcement and kind of what it might mean for Net and Yahoo [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1116.5800000000002s)]
*  I mean, there's always this moment where a horrific thing happens on a leaders watch [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1121.8600000000001s)]
*  Does the country blame him or her for it or do they rally around him or her for it? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1127.02s)]
*  It's never clear where it's gonna go. Yeah, I mean, I thought it was interesting [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1131.22s)]
*  I think you know, first of all on the Palestinian side were reminded, you know [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1135.6200000000001s)]
*  What a bunch of assholes Hamas are, you know [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1141.7s)]
*  And how ideological they are. I mean, I think sometimes, you know, we can make the mistake of seeing them as this kind of governing [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1145.6200000000001s)]
*  corrupt governing [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1151.8600000000001s)]
*  Repressive entity in Gaza that occasionally fires rockets, but these are people that you know are committed [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1153.46s)]
*  You know don't recognize Israel's right to exist are committed to to armed resistance and they're acting on that in the most extreme way that [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1158.22s)]
*  they ever have [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1164.8600000000001s)]
*  if [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1165.8600000000001s)]
*  You know [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1166.38s)]
*  They're doing that in part because of the calculus of the divisions in the Israeli government, which I think is as we said quite possible [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1166.94s)]
*  My guess here is it that all of Israel rallies together like Israel has like a society [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1173.26s)]
*  That has kind of within its DNA. I think [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1179.9s)]
*  an ability when threatened [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1183.9s)]
*  to kind of put aside differences and rally together and for reserves to be called up and [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1186.78s)]
*  for politicians to put aside even really deep grievances and [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1192.5s)]
*  So I would expect you know some effort to pull together unity government. It will be interesting to see you know, whether [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1196.94s)]
*  You know if I'm BB I take that out, right? [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1205.38s)]
*  You know try to get rid of some of the more crazy people around you and stabilize the politics while you're doing this [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1208.02s)]
*  Even the more moderate Israeli politicians like Gantz you talk about a probably be supportive of a very brutal response here [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1214.54s)]
*  So that's my expectation now. It's possible that some of these far-right people [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1221.66s)]
*  You know are start challenging BB from the right, you know, like you should just completely destroy and flatten this place [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1226.14s)]
*  I worry about that. I also worry Tommy about like Israeli settlers going all vigilante and just attacking Palestinians [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1231.78s)]
*  Which was already happening by the way in the West Bank. So you could have a situation where Israel's rallying together and [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1239.54s)]
*  That may bring about a unity government of sorts [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1246.6200000000001s)]
*  But you also have the far-right kind of acting on its own or [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1249.1s)]
*  Israeli Palestinian clashes separate apart from kind of the action in Gaza and that that has the real risk of spiraling too [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1252.6599999999999s)]
*  So, you know even a more cohesive Israeli government doesn't necessarily mean that there won't be these fractures [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1259.4199999999998s)]
*  With some Israelis wanting to go even harder at the Palestinians [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1264.78s)]
*  Yeah, so speaking of the far-right before we get to some of the discord questions the far-right MAGA Republicans in the US [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1268.1799999999998s)]
*  Wasted not one second before [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1276.0200000000002s)]
*  politicizing this issue and using [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1279.7s)]
*  What's happening in Israel an ongoing terrorist attack to attack Joe Biden? Here's a clip from Donald Trump and [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1282.1000000000001s)]
*  What's going on with Israel right now people were shocked. I wasn't shocked because two weeks ago we gave him six billion dollars [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1288.7800000000002s)]
*  Think of it. So we get five they get five but the difference is we have to give six billion six billion [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1295.8200000000002s)]
*  Does anyone know what a billion is? [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1300.2600000000002s)]
*  So that was Donald Trump [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1303.26s)]
*  JD Vance [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1305.26s)]
*  Republican senator from Ohio tweeted as we watch this horrible situation in Israel unfold [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1307.14s)]
*  Americans must face the stark truth our tax dollars funded this money is fungible and many of the dollars we sent to Iran are being [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1311.54s)]
*  Used to now kill innocent people this must stop Israel has every right to defend itself [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1318.1s)]
*  I wish our friends well, but most of all, I wish they weren't fighting its weapons bought with our money. So just to clarify [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1322.42s)]
*  No US tax dollars went to Iran. I assume what JD Vance and Trump are referencing is [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1327.82s)]
*  the hostage negotiation that just got back a bunch of [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1335.22s)]
*  American prisoners from Iran in that instance money that had been frozen in a South Korean bank [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1338.78s)]
*  Was transferred to Qatar by the way [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1344.8600000000001s)]
*  That was Iranian money from Iranian oil sales that were made before sanctions locked them up in South Korea [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1347.14s)]
*  That money is now sitting in this Qatari Bank [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1352.7s)]
*  It can only be spent on non-sanctioned goods like food and medicine [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1354.98s)]
*  Medical devices things that are approved by Washington by the Treasury Department [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1359.34s)]
*  Qatar directly pays those suppliers the money doesn't go to Iran and by the way, none of that money has been spent [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1364.14s)]
*  That's so if you pretty important you want to claim that all money is fungible. Sure [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1371.6200000000001s)]
*  We can go into that sort of like, you know reductive it ridiculous place, but unspent money isn't fungible [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1375.46s)]
*  You fucking idiot. So it's just like it's so [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1382.54s)]
*  Disgusting then that these guys immediately would leap to politicize an ongoing terror attack [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1385.62s)]
*  And by the way, of course Iran does provide Hamas with money that they use for terrorist attacks [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1391.86s)]
*  That is true [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1397.74s)]
*  But none of this money that went from South Korea to a Qatari Bank [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1398.66s)]
*  Was used in what happened today and to suggest otherwise is just you're either an idiot or you're a liar [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1402.42s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you know, you've pointed out a number of ways in which it's stupid [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1407.74s)]
*  I'll just point out one more as we were saying this is really complicated piece of business [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1411.06s)]
*  They clearly were planning this for many many months [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1415.54s)]
*  There's just no way that they got together in a couple weeks and put this together, right? So [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1418.94s)]
*  They were planning this long before that deal was even done, you know [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1424.34s)]
*  So not only is the money not been spent it's kind of impossible that you know [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1428.1799999999998s)]
*  Eight months ago the mosque got together and was like we anticipate the that on you know, six months from now [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1431.8999999999999s)]
*  There'll be a deal for these hostage. It's just stupid and and I think what it speaks to is a couple things one is [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1438.18s)]
*  This entire issue much to the detriment of Israelis and Palestinians in the US is just there's these stupid [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1446.42s)]
*  Domestic politics around it right like Donald Trump is someone who wants to be president United States in year [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1454.26s)]
*  He has no policy. He has nothing to say about like what he'd actually do here what he'd do differently from Joe Biden [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1458.66s)]
*  Probably wouldn't be doing anything differently than Joe Biden [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1464.46s)]
*  and [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1467.24s)]
*  And he's just like, you know playing some old hits, you know [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1469.04s)]
*  And that's the other thing I'd say is that they get away with this crap, you know [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1472.06s)]
*  Like they they're rewarded for it. Like they they issue statements like this. The statements are reported on [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1475.76s)]
*  They're playing they're doing this because they think it worked for them in the past when they said Obama gave them money [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1480.72s)]
*  And that was responsible for every bad thing Iran did [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1485.84s)]
*  Or they say things like JD Vance saying it's American taxpayer funded [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1489.4s)]
*  Like, you know 99% of people consume that statement or it's just gonna be given to them with no fact-checking nobody saying it's wrong [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1493.24s)]
*  right, and so I [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1499.52s)]
*  Think part of the status quo I described that has failed is a status quo where in the US [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1501.0s)]
*  Like you're kind of rewarded for having like dumb takes that have the lowest common denominator partisan frame on this thing [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1505.9599999999998s)]
*  And and absolutely no [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1512.7199999999998s)]
*  Responsibility for actually solving this issue another [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1514.8s)]
*  Domestic talking point was that the Abraham Accords was a peace agreement [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1517.48s)]
*  It wasn't a piece it was a normalization deal with countries that Israel wasn't at war with [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1520.68s)]
*  It was not peace clearly but with the Palestinians who are the people that are in conflict with Israel [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1524.8400000000001s)]
*  So, you know our own politics and media is part of a status quo that is completely broken down [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1529.4s)]
*  Yeah, and by the way, I mean there's a clip going around now on Twitter of [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1535.68s)]
*  Fox News correspondent fact-checking these claims but when you share that with you know, sort of the MAGA people they they don't care [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1539.32s)]
*  They're like, oh you must be so naive, you know money is fungible [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1545.56s)]
*  You know a bunch of bunch of dudes with like Bitcoin eyes in there in there their Twitter their ex bio their ex bio [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1548.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, there's a bunch of crypto bros trying to explain the concept of fungibility to me. Anyway, so Ben [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1554.6799999999998s)]
*  Some some discord questions [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1561.2s)]
*  So Zach asks a major debate in the media will be between the this is an unprovoked attack [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1562.84s)]
*  Response or characterization versus Israel brought this on themselves due to their own actions [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1569.08s)]
*  Characterization, how do you think people should be thinking about fault and justification as this conflict unfolds? I think this is a really good question [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1574.72s)]
*  It's a really hard question [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1581.76s)]
*  Just a couple thoughts from me. I mean, I do think it's important to say as you did earlier [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1584.24s)]
*  This was a terrorist attack. I think it's important to [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1587.44s)]
*  condemn terrorist attacks and the murder of civilians always [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1590.8s)]
*  forever, you know, like there's just unequivocal condemnation of what Hamas did here [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1595.16s)]
*  But we also can't view this event in abstraction where there's decades of history in this conflict and I think [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1600.12s)]
*  Diplomacy and our job here on this show is trying to [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1605.48s)]
*  Understand and sometimes even have empathy for your enemy so you can figure out how to solve these problems and just we have to remember [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1608.4399999999998s)]
*  That you know Hamas has been in control of the Gaza Strip since 2007 in Israel has had a blockade on [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1614.1599999999999s)]
*  Gaza for the entirety of that time. It's led to [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1619.96s)]
*  really [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1623.56s)]
*  Deplorable conditions and there are regular IDF bombings on Gaza [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1625.12s)]
*  There have been several brutal extended wars that you mentioned earlier and Gaza's never really recovered from those [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1628.8s)]
*  So the conditions are terrible and again terrorism is evil killing civilians is never justifiable [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1634.74s)]
*  But you also have to try to understand how [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1639.96s)]
*  people who are desperate do awful things and how a brutal occupation can empower and radicalize [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1643.08s)]
*  The worst elements and militant leaders and so, you know, I think [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1650.94s)]
*  the reason people want to see [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1655.94s)]
*  Middle East peace talks lead to the creation of the Palestinian state is [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1658.82s)]
*  Because the only way Israelis and Palestinians are going to break this cycle of violence is through some sort of political solution [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1662.5s)]
*  And neither side is going to be able to solve it militarily, right? [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1669.8999999999999s)]
*  I mean even with an unbelievably powerful IDF all the resources that the Israeli government has for intelligence [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1673.46s)]
*  Like they can't prevent or solve this problem in that way. There's got to be some sort of diplomatic solution [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1678.62s)]
*  So that's the very long-winded but I think you know relevant context to think about [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1683.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean this is the question and I think like we ever you know, you look at [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1687.9399999999998s)]
*  This is a tough one to weigh in on on Twitter [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1692.82s)]
*  You know like it's hard to distill this and it and frankly like US politicians [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1695.2399999999998s)]
*  Like don't do a lot of nuance on this. I think we have a responsibility to do a little nuance in this [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1700.78s)]
*  Here not nuance in the sense of look what Hamas did there's no nuance there at all that that's wrong [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1706.42s)]
*  I mean the the decision to [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1712.96s)]
*  You know take civilians hostage to just start shooting people in Israeli [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1716.18s)]
*  Settlements and towns to launch rockets indiscriminately into Israel like that's horrific that should be condemned [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1721.5s)]
*  There's no justification for that [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1728.58s)]
*  at the same time [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1731.34s)]
*  Like we can't act like this is happening in some total vacuum where you know [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1733.34s)]
*  We have no idea why this is happening. The reality is first of all [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1738.28s)]
*  Things have been building in recent months [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1742.62s)]
*  I don't the exact numbers in front of me [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1745.02s)]
*  but hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of Palestinians have been killed this year by Israeli security forces and a [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1747.22s)]
*  significant number of Israel Israelis have been killed by [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1753.78s)]
*  Palestinian militants this has not been like a totally peaceful situation that just exploded [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1756.5s)]
*  There's been a lot of warning signs, you know from confrontations at holy sites to this violence around Israeli settlements in the West Bank [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1760.98s)]
*  to terrorist attacks in Israel [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1769.9s)]
*  So there's this is a massive massive escalation by Hamas [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1771.94s)]
*  But I think it has to be seen as an escalation of what has been an ongoing conflict in an ongoing low-level war [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1776.5s)]
*  And I also think we have to like acknowledge we say this every time [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1783.66s)]
*  This is the fifth Gaza war since 2007 and [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1788.26s)]
*  The idea that you can just squeeze these people blockade these people, you know occasionally go to you know [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1792.26s)]
*  Bombard them and that somehow that's going to lead this resistance to go away [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1798.94s)]
*  This is not even about assigning blame [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1804.62s)]
*  This is about just pointing out that that policy has not worked in preventing this from from occurring [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1806.86s)]
*  And so absent a political settlement that involves some kind of Palestinian state you are either going to have [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1813.1599999999999s)]
*  Continued flare-ups and escalations of a conflict like this or you're gonna have to have the kind of wholesale [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1821.48s)]
*  Destruction of Hamas and probably significant, you know dislocation of Palestinians and and there's not some third way [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1828.6399999999999s)]
*  I think people in the US keep coping that if they ignore this, you know, it'll just settle down and [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1835.36s)]
*  Know like that's that there are only a couple ways this can go and right now [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1841.48s)]
*  We're seeing the worst place it can go which is a lot of violence and loss of life [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1845.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and you know in terms of those negotiations in a possible Middle East peace [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1849.72s)]
*  Settlement, I mean we focus [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1853.72s)]
*  more on the Israeli side of those negotiations than the Palestinian Authority side because of the power dynamic, right because [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1855.76s)]
*  Because one is an occupying power the other is being occupied one side as the backing of the United States one does not [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1863.3600000000001s)]
*  But it's also worth pointing out that you know [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1869.3000000000002s)]
*  Mahmoud Abbas [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1871.1000000000001s)]
*  Released a statement about what happened this terrorist attack and he said quote the Palestinian people's right to defend themselves against settler terrorism and occupation forces [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1872.14s)]
*  Was the part of it? He stressed so, you know, I think that people who feel like [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1879.38s)]
*  The Israelis are lacking a credible partner to negotiate with when it comes to a boss are not wrong [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1885.94s)]
*  This is a guy who you know [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1891.48s)]
*  Basically lived with Arafat in Tunisia 60 years ago and that has led into this moment, but he has no actual authority [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1893.18s)]
*  among the Palestinian people or really ability to [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1901.42s)]
*  Negotiate I mean doesn't have a lot of space because it's just sort of an old man hanging on [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1905.54s)]
*  You know, everyone has some stake in that right Palestinians [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1909.8200000000002s)]
*  Have obviously responsibility for the nature of their leadership to some extent [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1913.78s)]
*  But so does everybody else right because Israel has kind of not allowed if you're like a [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1919.58s)]
*  Like a peaceful popular alternative to either Hamas or the PA [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1924.3799999999999s)]
*  like, you know [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1928.22s)]
*  there's not a lot of space for you to merge Israel has been in the scenario where they're comfortable having a [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1929.0s)]
*  totally corrupt broken Palestinian Authority and then a totally radical Hamas and and in the US same thing we fund the Palestinian Authority kind of [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1933.5s)]
*  Ignore like how out of touch it is how sclerotic it is [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1941.1399999999999s)]
*  You've got Iran and and and others who've obviously funded Hamas you've got Qatar that puts a lot of money in like nobody who has [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1944.4s)]
*  relationships into [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1952.36s)]
*  Palestinian leadership has done much to create some alternative to what we've talked about here [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1953.52s)]
*  Obviously some people have worse intentions than others in that regard [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1960.28s)]
*  So I'm not suggesting equivalency across the board [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1963.96s)]
*  What I am saying is the current state of the Palestinian leadership is not just the fault of the Palestinians [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1966.84s)]
*  It's the fault of the entire dynamic that has been created over the course of you know, the decades since Oslo. Yeah, well said [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1971.4399999999998s)]
*  So mark why from the Paz a the world discord asks net Yahoo and like who generally have entrenched themselves pretty deeply with American conservatism [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1978.08s)]
*  What does any kind of lasting peace deal look like in that world? How does Biden or any Democrat work for peace in that environment? [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1985.4799999999998s)]
*  You know, then I think we've talked about this a lot [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1992.6s)]
*  I mean, I think we've long questioned whether Netanyahu is really interested in Middle East peace negotiations [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=1995.76s)]
*  because any outcome would require concessions and giving up territory and [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2003.84s)]
*  Clearly his right-wing base of support sees those concessions as a non-starter [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2009.08s)]
*  I mean they they they viewed pausing settlement construction as a non-starter. So [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2013.4s)]
*  instead [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2018.76s)]
*  the Trump administration and [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2020.04s)]
*  And [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2022.1599999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu poured all their efforts into the Abraham Accords, which you mentioned earlier [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2023.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean these were not peace deals. There were deals where the US gave lots of stuff [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2027.76s)]
*  usually weapons to countries that were not at war with Israel and then [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2032.52s)]
*  Convinced them to announce the normalization of relations [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2038.0s)]
*  But you know those agreements had nothing to do with the Palestinians [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2040.92s)]
*  They they were arms sales and they just sort of left the Palestinian issue as an afterthought [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2044.12s)]
*  So [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2049.4s)]
*  How does Biden work for that? I mean, I don't know in this context [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2050.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean it every everything has changed in the last 48 hours and [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2053.76s)]
*  It felt like the Middle East peace process was completely dead before this [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2059.04s)]
*  It's worse now, but you know, I do think that [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2063.56s)]
*  what we've seen over the past couple years is just the slow erosion of the possibility of a Palestinian state because of settlement construction because [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2068.56s)]
*  of bad faith and politics, etc. The list goes on and on and [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2075.46s)]
*  I don't have a lot of hope for it getting better now [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2079.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean you know Trump in addition to normalization deals, you know [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2081.6400000000003s)]
*  They also moved the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. It kind of abandoned [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2085.2400000000002s)]
*  Like support for a two-state solution began to resolve final status issues like moving the capital [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2091.1200000000003s)]
*  You know Jews the status of Jerusalem and Israel's capital was a final status issue that was supposed to be negotiated between Israelis and Palestinians [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2096.8s)]
*  And so steps like that kind of [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2104.44s)]
*  Combined with the growth of Israeli settlements into the West Bank, you know [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2106.56s)]
*  Makes even talking about a Palestinian state seem ridiculous and absurd [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2111.32s)]
*  given the realities on the ground and and and and if you're Israel this attack is gonna make you know incentivize only [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2116.0s)]
*  And a focus on security which is gonna probably contribute to obviously less of a movement for peace [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2123.6800000000003s)]
*  and you know a lot of [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2130.76s)]
*  Destruction in the days ahead. What can you do though? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2133.0400000000004s)]
*  I just say a couple of things that I'll try to say things that are different than the obvious things that people say [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2135.5200000000004s)]
*  Get back to peace negotiations. I think one [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2140.48s)]
*  You know, there's been this effort in recent days to say we want normalization [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2144.88s)]
*  But maybe we can try to get some things for the Saudis for the Palestinians like some [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2147.84s)]
*  investment in Palestinian territories [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2152.32s)]
*  I think let's just you we have to start to bring the Palestinian issue much more into this kind of regional diplomacy [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2154.0400000000004s)]
*  I think the smart thing to do on the back end of what I hope is not that long of a military [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2162.32s)]
*  Confrontation would be to say like how do we all get together here and try to build an alternative and more coherent Palestinian leadership, you know [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2167.8s)]
*  There's a lot of money in that region. This is not cash poor people in the Gulf [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2176.92s)]
*  And so there's a true concerted sincere effort and look Israel [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2181.96s)]
*  You know would have to to some extent go along with this but to say, you know what? [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2186.1600000000003s)]
*  Like there is something unsustainable about Hamas and the PA right now [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2191.02s)]
*  What does it mean to develop inside of? [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2194.86s)]
*  Palestine a different kind of partner that can be dealt with and they can give some hope to Palestinians at the same time and some [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2198.38s)]
*  sense of the Israelis that [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2204.42s)]
*  We don't have to either rely on an old man [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2206.5s)]
*  Like you said some chain-smoking old man that used to hang out there fat and and then you got a mosque down in Gaza [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2209.04s)]
*  Right, that's one thing and but ultimately the only way this changes [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2214.34s)]
*  Is it's not something that the US can do there's no peace formula here that can change the politics [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2219.06s)]
*  Israel and and the Palestinians are gonna have to change internally and [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2225.46s)]
*  Decide that they want to make peace with each other. And again that that seems incredibly distant now [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2229.18s)]
*  Maybe maybe on the back end of what could be a horrific conflict [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2235.62s)]
*  Some people stand up and say we're tired of doing this but whatever the US can do to foster [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2239.74s)]
*  A [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2245.1s)]
*  Movement inside of these societies that is for peace and not this kind of protracted endless war or the complete, you know [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2246.2999999999997s)]
*  disregard for Israeli [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2254.8999999999996s)]
*  Safety or disregard for Palestinian aspirations like that's I think where you have to focus more attention [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2256.74s)]
*  Yeah, and a lot of people asked about what you know [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2262.62s)]
*  What the last couple of days events could mean for these US efforts to normalize relations between the Saudis? [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2264.8599999999997s)]
*  and the Israelis [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2272.4599999999996s)]
*  You know, I do think it's worth just pointing out that mob of insalmon during his Fox News interview said that any [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2274.46s)]
*  Normalization deal would require like meaningful progress towards the Palestinian state Tony Blinken [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2279.7400000000002s)]
*  Made similar similar comments to us when we interviewed him [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2285.82s)]
*  Then I do think that you know those concessions that would be required from Netanyahu probably get a lot harder politically for him [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2289.34s)]
*  After this attack, I would also just point out that you know, despite all this [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2297.78s)]
*  Talk of approach modern normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2302.5s)]
*  the [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2307.58s)]
*  Saudi statement about what just happened was not [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2309.06s)]
*  particularly supportive [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2313.58s)]
*  of the Israelis [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2315.8999999999996s)]
*  I mean they talked about sort of both sides the whole thing [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2317.3799999999997s)]
*  They called for a halt of escalation [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2320.7799999999997s)]
*  And then it says the kingdom recalls its repeated warnings of the dangers of the explosion of the situation as a result of the continued occupation [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2323.1s)]
*  The depravation of the Palestinian people of their illegitimate rights and the repetition of the systematic provocations against its sanctities again like [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2329.98s)]
*  Things that I think you know, we've talked about it in context in this show [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2338.1s)]
*  But it wasn't a statement that seemed like a future partner future ally showing support for a country in its sort of darkest moment [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2341.6600000000003s)]
*  In fact, it was seemed like [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2350.34s)]
*  The criticism more than anything else. Yeah [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2353.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I think that like a short-term consequence of this is probably going to be to [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2356.5s)]
*  You know make normalization impossible in the near term if the Saudi statement out of the gate on the day in which there's the maximum [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2363.34s)]
*  Horrific Israeli loss of life if they can't even focus on that and are already in a state where they're essentially casting [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2372.34s)]
*  You know most of the blame on Israel [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2379.52s)]
*  After there starts to be these images of what are probably gonna be like an enormous Palestinian loss of life [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2381.92s)]
*  MBS is capacity. I mean a man who doesn't worry that much about public opinion, but I mean to cut a deal with Israel [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2389.28s)]
*  In that context gets very hard for him [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2396.8s)]
*  Because there is such a thing as their public opinion now [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2399.64s)]
*  Also, like as you said for Netanyahu to make some concessions to a Palestinian state [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2402.0s)]
*  That would be necessary to get the deal done the first place well that also gets harder for him, too [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2408.36s)]
*  So it doesn't kill normalization forever because I think you know [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2412.6000000000004s)]
*  It's still something that MBS wants if he gets all this stuff from us [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2416.04s)]
*  but I think in the near term at least it pushes it forward and [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2419.0s)]
*  And the whole [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2424.7200000000003s)]
*  You know whole regions gonna have to digest this and you know [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2426.2400000000002s)]
*  Like I said, is there a bigger war with his blah or with or the Iranians or is there other violence in the region? [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2429.04s)]
*  Are there protests on the Arab Street like we just don't know and so I think the region's gonna have to take a minute here [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2435.28s)]
*  To see what happens and to digest it before kind of looking at where normalization stands [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2441.44s)]
*  We have to have her one more we're going a little long, but [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2446.32s)]
*  Katz dia from the discord asks [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2449.2000000000003s)]
*  To what extent can we blame BB specifically? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2452.2400000000002s)]
*  Meaning to the the [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2456.6800000000003s)]
*  Netanyahu's judicial coup efforts like to what extent was that? [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2459.44s)]
*  Responsible in some way for what happened today, and you know I think the short answer is you know [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2463.36s)]
*  Hamas is responsible for what happened today, but I think [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2468.12s)]
*  In addition to that there are lots of reports as we mentioned at the top of [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2472.1600000000003s)]
*  The Israeli military the Mossad again the Shin Bet [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2476.44s)]
*  warning about the military's readiness and this perception of weakness [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2479.56s)]
*  There was a I saw a reporter from yeti out a run out tweet about how on July 28th the IDF's [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2484.28s)]
*  Intelligence chief alerted the prime minister with four urgent letters [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2490.2s)]
*  Suggesting that Israel's adversaries perceived it as historically weak given all that context [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2493.7999999999997s)]
*  I think this was especially true in the Air Force [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2498.88s)]
*  And as you mentioned earlier Ben I mean there's all these reports that IDF units were in the West Bank [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2501.88s)]
*  Dealing with settler violence and that some of these bases in the south near Gaza that were overrun [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2507.4s)]
*  Were were understaffed so again. I mean I think there's a lot we don't know [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2514.16s)]
*  And there will be a lot of questions and investigations into how this happened and how these sort of like [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2519.32s)]
*  Really well armed bases were overrun and whether people blame that in Yahoo for that or not, but it's a it's a big question [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2524.76s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm glad you said it though. I mean look we are it's hard to find bigger critics of BB. You know [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2532.1600000000003s)]
*  And you know we've not shied from that on this podcast even but I mean this [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2539.36s)]
*  what happened today is Hamas's responsibility and [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2543.88s)]
*  You you know you have to [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2546.88s)]
*  Right now like feel a great degree of empathy for like look some of the Israelis who are you know? [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2549.56s)]
*  Being targeted here [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2556.2s)]
*  Are people that have been fighting against the judicial coup you know this is indiscriminate and nobody should be I mean like [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2558.2s)]
*  It's not okay to target anybody, but point is that this is indiscriminate violence. This is Hamas's fault [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2565.48s)]
*  This is who they are and I think we should all [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2570.3199999999997s)]
*  Think about and you know keeping our our thoughts obviously like the Israelis who are dealing with rockets and [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2572.88s)]
*  You know that people being kidnapped and it's me horrific images and stories that come out in the coming days [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2579.28s)]
*  I think the BB of it all though is it? [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2584.92s)]
*  Like there's this this presumption that there's not a consequence to [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2588.04s)]
*  Kind of this brand of far-right politics, and there's not a consequence to [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2594.76s)]
*  The provocations that we've seen the attacks on Palestinians [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2598.52s)]
*  the kind of complete [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2601.8s)]
*  Loss of any hope or even rhetoric or not you know words being mouthed about Palestinian state like [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2604.08s)]
*  That has not made Israel secure and that that was Netanyahu's core argument. Mr. Securities in the nickname. He gave himself, right? [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2611.1200000000003s)]
*  And and it will be fascinating to see whether Israelis kind of or will be able to [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2619.32s)]
*  Whether Israelis kind of are willing to sweep this under the rug and say let's rally around the flag that I think that'll be the initial [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2625.84s)]
*  Impulse but as the days go on people are gonna ask like how did this happen? [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2633.52s)]
*  Why did this happen and is this really the best way to protect Israel? [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2636.7200000000003s)]
*  I hope that that leads to a healthy debate and not just kind of a lurch to the right and and and and ignoring [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2640.48s)]
*  You know that [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2647.56s)]
*  That maybe having this kind of far-right government is a really unsustainable thing [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2649.08s)]
*  It's added to the kind of sense of a tinderbox it [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2654.08s)]
*  You know exploded bigger this time than it did the last time there was a Gaza war even two years ago and [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2657.7200000000003s)]
*  We'll see I think right now we should all like I feel so much for the Israelis who are in the line of fire [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2663.96s)]
*  I feel so much for the Palestinians in Gaza [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2669.32s)]
*  I mean, can you imagine just being a normal Palestinian family living in some high-rise apartment in Gaza? [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2672.32s)]
*  You didn't plan this attack you're not in Hamas [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2678.76s)]
*  You can't get out of Gaza like when BB Nanny houses evacuate and these are people that did nothing wrong [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2681.8s)]
*  They're gonna suffer a lot and that to me is the ultimate tragedy this whole thing [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2687.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean they're gonna suffer from essentially from the bombings [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2691.7200000000003s)]
*  They're gonna suffer from you know crumbling infrastructure the power getting set off cut off [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2695.4s)]
*  But also I think the Israeli government allows about 20,000 Gazans to cross the border [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2699.88s)]
*  And work in Israel and then bring that money home that is absolutely critical for the economy in Gaza [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2705.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm sure that will get cut off [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2711.32s)]
*  And to your point Ben. Yeah, I mean like there's reports that [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2714.12s)]
*  Hamas attacked a bunch of young kids at a music festival like I guarantee you those were kids who were out in the streets [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2717.44s)]
*  Protesting the judicial coup there's reports. I read this just horrifying story about a man whose [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2724.24s)]
*  Wife and two young girls were kidnapped and taken and they geo located her phone and it's now in Gaza, you know [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2731.24s)]
*  Right. So these are innocent people being terrorized by fucking evil terrorists [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2737.3999999999996s)]
*  I do think though, you know, the question will become just for basic accountability. Like how does this happen? [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2741.52s)]
*  How does it how do we prevent it from happening again? And I do wonder if Israeli citizens think Netanyahu? [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2747.0s)]
*  Created this political dysfunction that allowed for an event like this to happen or of Netanyahu [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2755.68s)]
*  Blames the protesters for this happening and is able to sort of make this politically advantageous to him. Obviously [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2761.3999999999996s)]
*  that kind of [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2768.72s)]
*  right-wing attack in the name of total security is something we're familiar with here and in the US and something that is [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2770.3199999999997s)]
*  Pretty powerful politics. Yeah, especially in politics in moments like this [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2777.2799999999997s)]
*  I think what to look for coming next is obviously the scale and brutality of the Israeli response [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2781.26s)]
*  Whether Hamas has any other tactics any other surprises up its sleeve [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2787.34s)]
*  Whether this escalates in terms of his bligging involved whether there's an escalation between Israel and Iran [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2792.1000000000004s)]
*  But also these hostages. I mean that's where this is going [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2797.34s)]
*  Gilad Shalit one Israeli soldier taken or you know [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2802.98s)]
*  A couple of Israeli soldiers taken by his one two and six led to a pretty major war one Israeli soldier taken led to [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2806.06s)]
*  You know Israel going into Gaza and ultimately a prisoner exchange in which a thousand plus [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2811.82s)]
*  you know for all the criticisms of Biden's prisoner exchanges a [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2816.58s)]
*  Thousand plus Palestinians were released in exchange for this one soldier if as it appears [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2819.98s)]
*  There are dozens and dozens and maybe even hundreds of Israeli hostages and Hamas is claiming that they have more than [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2824.62s)]
*  Than the Israeli government even said the Israeli government's acknowledged dozens that that could go on for years [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2830.46s)]
*  You know, I mean we you know, this could be a feature of this whole conflict for a long time. And so to me [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2835.66s)]
*  This that's where this is ultimately going is what where are those people? [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2844.2599999999998s)]
*  What is their fate does Israel try to just destroy Hamas militarily to get those people back or they stop at some point and negotiate [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2847.74s)]
*  You know some ceasefire and some kind of prisoner exchange [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2855.3799999999997s)]
*  We don't know but right now I have to say I [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2859.7799999999997s)]
*  Fear the worst in terms of at least the immediate loss of life for for Israelis and you know, frankly more [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2862.98s)]
*  Palestinians likely to die in the coming days and most of the people [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2870.0600000000004s)]
*  You know who are gonna die almost all the people who are gonna die [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2874.02s)]
*  Didn't do anything to deserve it and that's the real tragedy of this whole thing. Yeah. Yeah. Well said I [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2878.6200000000003s)]
*  Every subsequent thing I read about this gives me just a deeper pit in my stomach for what comes next [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2884.26s)]
*  As you said because yeah, I mean I think what's most likely is a horrific war in Gaza that could include [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2889.62s)]
*  ground forces and casualty counts that we've we've not seen the likes of in a long time or [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2897.3799999999997s)]
*  An occupation or something much broader in a regional war that could include some sort of direct conflict with Iran [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2903.14s)]
*  I mean, those are the things people are worried about right now. So all I can do is hope and pray and [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2908.1s)]
*  Wish for the best man, but it's bad [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2913.7799999999997s)]
*  Okay, I think that is it for us obviously we'll cover this again on Tuesday [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2916.0600000000004s)]
*  Thank you to everyone in the crooked discord for sending such great questions [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2919.02s)]
*  Really smart thoughtful people crooked comm slash friends if you want to check it out and that's it for us. Thanks for listening [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItvwosUtaKY&t=2924.02s)]
