# Pope Says He's Working on Secret 'Mission' to End War in Ukraine
**Pod Save the World:** [May 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI)
*  Welcome back to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Ben Rhodes. Ben, I was in Florida over the weekend [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=0.0s)]
*  You're in Germany now, you know, basically the same thing, right? Similar vibes [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=4.88s)]

*  We did a we just did a two and a half hour roundtable with young leaders [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=15.52s)]
*  It was kind of inspiring actually. How many how many leaders? We had 18 [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=19.740000000000002s)]
*  From like across Europe people trying to do the right thing trying to fix things that are broken [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=24.12s)]
*  So that made you feel a little bit better about things. That's cool [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=29.16s)]
*  So 18 kids from across when you say young like what's young these days? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=32.24s)]
*  I mean actually like the young is like in your 30s, right? Like these are people like we had like a member of the European Parliament [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=36.24s)]
*  We've got people fighting corruption and hungry [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=42.56s)]
*  We've got people we've had a couple of Pod Save the World guests [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=45.68s)]
*  The woman who does Hannah who runs a Green New Deal in the UK [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=49.24s)]
*  Like we had some good mix of activists and people in politics. It was great. Excellent. That's a great group [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=53.14s)]
*  I wish and next time let's just bring the mic to the roundtable and just let I know you feel I was singing that [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=58.08s)]
*  Like what good number of them said that to me there we had some world those in the in the crowd today [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  So like it's not a bad idea next time. We'll just stream the whole thing [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=68.24s)]
*  Well, we have a great show a great show for everyone today [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=71.56s)]
*  We're gonna keep talking about this ongoing crisis in Sudan how the Pope is [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=74.16s)]
*  Trying to make peace in Ukraine really interesting story over the weekend about his travels to Budapest [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=79.2s)]
*  King Charles's coronation is coming up [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=84.24s)]
*  There's an old but new phone hacking scandal for Rupert Murdoch a big election set of elections in Turkey [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=86.83999999999999s)]
*  the latest on the Pentagon discord leaks a star was born been at the Korean state visit in Washington and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  Then Rhonda santa's is foreign trip seems to have gone a little south. That's the window from here [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=99.56s)]
*  I think that's fair to say I heard you guys kind of [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  Deliver a few like body blows on positive America, and I'm happy to try to finish off on the same [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=109.22000000000001s)]
*  Are you saying he hasn't electrified Germany in the press over there? Not exactly. No, it's not [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=115.06s)]
*  There's not like a lingering sense of it's funny [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=120.5s)]
*  Actually, I'm staying in the hotel that we stayed at during the 2008 foreign trip when Obama spoke like 250,000 people here [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=123.30000000000001s)]
*  And let's just say that there's not a similar vibe that Ron DeSantis left behind here. There's more like a stench [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=129.58s)]
*  Rhonda fantasy you get 25 people at the Brandenburg Gate not [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=136.18s)]
*  But then let's start in Sudan [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=140.74s)]
*  Because the situation there seems to be getting worse by the day as we discussed last week [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=143.14000000000001s)]
*  There has been this power struggle between the Sudanese military led by general Abdelfatah al-Burnham [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=148.26000000000002s)]
*  In a paramilitary force called the RSF led by another general known as Hamati [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=154.38000000000002s)]
*  This is turned into an all-out civil war over the past several days [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=159.94s)]
*  There have been some partial ceasefires that have helped people escape the cities and escape some of the fighting [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=163.46s)]
*  But have not really been ceasefires. I mean there's been you know, like literally airstrikes and cartoon during the ceasefire [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=169.5s)]
*  So it's still incredibly unsafe [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=175.10000000000002s)]
*  The World Health Organization says that at least 500 civilians have been killed in the fighting [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=178.14000000000001s)]
*  That is almost certainly a drastic undercount [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=182.46s)]
*  At least 50,000 people have left Sudan since the fighting started and the UN assistant high commissioner for refugees [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=184.46s)]
*  Said they are planning for a scenario where up to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=190.62s)]
*  815,000 people flee Sudan into its neighboring countries. So that's just a massive exodus [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=193.98s)]
*  Millions are still trapped in Khartoum Reuters reported that some people have even walked [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=200.26s)]
*  250 miles to South Sudan to escape the fighting [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=205.46s)]
*  Most others are getting out by taking a very dangerous 500 mile drive to the port of Sudan [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=208.5s)]
*  Where they then can escape via boat if they're lucky [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=214.26s)]
*  The US has organized at least three convoys to help evacuate over a thousand US citizens from Sudan [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=216.82000000000002s)]
*  The Saudi government is also evacuating a ton of people. I think they've gotten 5,000 people out of many different nationalities [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=222.58s)]
*  That obviously does nothing for the Sudanese people who are trapped in them nowhere to go [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=229.3s)]
*  And the New York Times reported that Sudan's health care system is on the brink of collapse [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=233.14000000000001s)]
*  the World Food Program said 16% of the food it had stockpiled in the country has been stolen and [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=237.9s)]
*  That wasn't enough to begin with to feed the population that's already struggling because of a bunch of failed rainy seasons [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=243.78s)]
*  So, you know the latest is Hamedi told Western media that you know, the military is being controlled by Islamist leaders [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=248.54s)]
*  He says that he and the RSF believe in in democracy and civilian control the government [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=254.94s)]
*  I think we have a lot of reasons to be skeptical of those sorts of claims from a warlord [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=259.82s)]
*  But fingers crossed that maybe that will you know lead him to negotiate and do something decent the former Sudanese Prime Minister [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=263.94s)]
*  Abdullah Hamdok said that he warned that the war could turn out worse than Syria and Libya [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=270.62s)]
*  Because this is not a war between an army and a small rebellion [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=275.90000000000003s)]
*  It is almost like two armies was his quote and he's right. These are two like incredibly well-armed armies [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=279.3s)]
*  So before we started recording Ben the UN top envoy in Sudan said the two sides have agreed to negotiate finally [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=284.24s)]
*  Just curious if you're seeing any signs that you're reading in the press or anywhere else that those talks are real this time [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=290.90000000000003s)]
*  Have a hope of succeeding or these gonna be kind of on again off again ceasefires [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=296.9s)]
*  I mean, I think it feels really bad Tommy. I mean you summarized it well [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=300.85999999999996s)]
*  I mean first of all [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=304.85999999999996s)]
*  the only thing that as you point out that only thing that seems to kind of diminish the fighting for periods of time is like [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=306.26s)]
*  coordinated evacuations of foreigners [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=312.9s)]
*  Yeah [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=314.9s)]
*  Which on the one end it's good that you know [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=315.85999999999996s)]
*  There is a capacity to like, you know [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=318.21999999999997s)]
*  Pull a lever and reduce the levels of violence and to coordinate with both of these sides to get people out [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=321.3s)]
*  the bad thing about that in a way is [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=327.82s)]
*  There's almost like a feeling that the foreigners are leaving so that the Civil War can kind of go on [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=331.82s)]
*  You know that like they know that they're getting ready for [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=337.66s)]
*  Like a really intense and protracted Civil War and so they're kind of allowing [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=341.04s)]
*  For foreigners to get out of the way so that that's not an element that they have to worry about [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=345.66s)]
*  So that that concerns me the other thing that concerns me is that if you listen to the rhetoric from the two sides like it's kind of [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=351.18s)]
*  Zero-sum, right? So have meti the kind of warlord who? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=357.16s)]
*  You know controls [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=361.46s)]
*  upwards a hundred thousand people in arms [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=363.54s)]
*  Including like remnants of the John Dewey malicious that carried out that the genocide in Darfur [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=366.82s)]
*  You know, he's talking about you know, the army being fatally compromised by this Islamist presence [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=372.98s)]
*  It has echoes and nothing's like a direct parallel but it's kind of like has these echoes of Libya [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=378.74s)]
*  Yeah, you have a warlord heftar in Libya [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=384.82s)]
*  Who was also backed by the Emiratis in the same way that they've backed this guy in Sudan? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=388.14s)]
*  Taking on Islamists and then you have military that you know [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=393.74s)]
*  There's nothing that suggests that the Sudanese military wants to relinquish its control over the state [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=396.94s)]
*  So it's kind of zero-sum for both sides because if one side [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=401.74s)]
*  Concedes to the other [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=405.62s)]
*  you have to think that's that's it for them and Sudanese politics and [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=407.58000000000004s)]
*  It just feels like this is heading in a bad direction and and honestly like those estimates [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=411.66s)]
*  Usually, you know, they can end up being on the low end, you know, so 800,000 could be like a floor [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=417.42s)]
*  Now hopefully that's not the case. Hopefully there's a ceasefire that can hold and lead to a political process [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=424.18s)]
*  But like right now I think if we're looking at this candidly it does not look good. Yeah, and it's just [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=428.86s)]
*  It [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=434.14s)]
*  The suffering is just compounding because Sudan has been a place that is I think taken in a lot of refugees [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=435.34s)]
*  from places like Yemen and these individuals are now being driven out sort of anywhere they can go and you know a [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=439.86s)]
*  million refugees flowing into any country could be destabilizing but you know flowing into a neighbor like Libya or Chad or [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=445.65999999999997s)]
*  South Sudan, you know countries that have been sort of struggling on their own in part because of these five or six failed rainy [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=453.3s)]
*  Seasons in the Horn of Africa like that seems completely unsustainable [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=459.34s)]
*  It's also interesting that the US went from a little more of a defensive position about like sort of [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=462.38s)]
*  Their ability or inability or willingness to help get refugees out to leading all these convoys [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=468.58s)]
*  I know I know what Jake Sullivan was saying when he was talking about the US obligation [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=474.02s)]
*  To essentially rescue people from the Civil War was that like we can't like send in the military and get them out [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=479.42s)]
*  But that we would try to help them [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=484.58s)]
*  But it does seem like they've really sort of turned up the dial on getting folks out in the last week or two [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=485.86s)]
*  No, they have I mean what's also clear is I mean [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=490.38s)]
*  I've heard from a few people that are either in Sudan or have family there and like everybody wants to leave, right? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=493.78s)]
*  so this this connects the first question because [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=501.1s)]
*  you know the people who kind of have the best sense of this are the people that are like living in the middle of [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=504.06s)]
*  It and the people that are living the middle of this want to get the hell out of Sudan [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=508.86s)]
*  You know whether they're American citizens or have the US, you know [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=512.74s)]
*  Green card status or whether they're just Sudanese who want to get out and so I think the US is responding to an enormous [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=516.78s)]

*  Speaking of peace oxben so Pope Francis on Sunday said that the Vatican is working on a secret mission to stop the war between [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=875.74s)]
*  Russia and Ukraine he revealed this to the Vatican press corps on a flight home from this three-day trip [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=881.94s)]
*  He took to Budapest where Pope Francis discussed the war with [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=888.1s)]
*  Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and a representative of the Russian Orthodox Church in Budapest [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=892.22s)]
*  Previously the Vatican has helped facilitate prisoner exchanges between the two sides [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=897.62s)]
*  So I think there is some sort of you know like [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=901.2199999999999s)]
*  Previous work to build on while in Hungary Pope Francis gave a speech to a crowd that included Orban [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=903.62s)]
*  Where he called on listeners to welcome migrants? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=909.16s)]
*  Here's a quote how sad and painful it is to see closed doors the closed doors of our selfishness with regard to others the closed [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=911.8199999999999s)]
*  Doors of our individualism amid a society of growing isolation the closed doors of our indifference towards the underprivileged and those who suffer [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=918.4s)]
*  The doors we close towards those who are foreign or unlike us towards migrants or the poor [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=925.66s)]
*  Pretty direct shot at Viktor Orban's immigration policies [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=930.86s)]
*  Unfortunately, but I don't know if you saw this in your times was there for the speech [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=934.54s)]
*  They interviewed a bunch of Hungarians in the audience about the speech and sort of like their reaction to it [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=938.02s)]
*  And a lot of them didn't really view it as a shot at Orban at all and generally seemed to support [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=943.18s)]
*  Orban's immigration policies and said well the fact that the Pope has been here three times now [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=948.1s)]
*  Suggests that he really likes Orban so a little dispiriting, but I don't know. What do you make of this? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=952.2199999999999s)]
*  High wire diplomas here by Pope Francis the whole thing with this was really interesting to me Tommy because like [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=957.7s)]
*  Francis was clearly balancing the fact that he knows that going to Hungary [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=965.22s)]
*  Validates Orban in a way, you know that Orban can sit there and there's the image of Francis coming to him [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=971.34s)]
*  As you pointed out with the people in the audience like the main thing that's sick with most people is just that Francis is there [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=977.5s)]
*  And is there again and you have a substantial Catholic population there and Orban has cast himself as a [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=983.6999999999999s)]
*  You know kind of Christian [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=990.54s)]
*  Nationalist right so Christianity is pretty central to the way in which Orban has built his political movement [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=992.54s)]
*  They're like a return to traditional Christian values, etc, etc [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=997.48s)]
*  Now clearly Francis thought I'll balance this out by like taking some shots and he called out nationalism [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1000.98s)]
*  He called out the immigration policy [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1007.66s)]
*  And [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1009.1s)]
*  And look I think that matters to an extent but you know Orban also kind of controls the media there, right? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1010.3s)]
*  So if you're watching like television in Hungary [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1015.9399999999999s)]
*  You're probably seeing the video of Francis kind of meeting with Orban and shaking his hand or whatever [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1018.8199999999999s)]
*  That's good point [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1024.7s)]
*  And you're not really hearing the messages that he delivered [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1025.34s)]
*  The only thing that I can think is that there's a history in Eastern Europe of the Catholic Church playing a kind of subversive role [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1028.42s)]
*  Right, like so Pope John Paul who is Polish? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1034.8799999999999s)]
*  Famously, you know was like critical to the anti-communism movement of the 80s [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1038.22s)]
*  Like the question is whether Francis's message reaches down through the church locally and like reaches people in that way [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1042.1s)]
*  And so in that way, it's kind of a longer game by Francis [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1050.58s)]
*  But I think Orban is probably pretty comfortable with the visit for now. It does seem like Francis is getting older [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1053.58s)]
*  right [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1059.5s)]
*  he's had some health issues and seems like he's really trying to like [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1059.6999999999998s)]
*  Address his legacy and trying to like he's speaking more openly and forthrightly about these issues [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1063.34s)]
*  Because again, he was pretty like outspoken and what he said about nationalism and migration [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1069.8999999999999s)]
*  the thing that like jumps out of course is this kind of reference to peace talks and I [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1074.1s)]
*  Don't know [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1079.06s)]
*  I mean I as someone who like dealt with the Vatican diplomatically like they were the third party in our [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1079.62s)]
*  Normalization of relations with Cuba like I have tremendous respect for their capacity to be kind of a neutral party mediator [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1085.62s)]
*  And and over the years Francis has tried to build up ties to the Russian Orthodox Church, which is very close to Putin [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1092.76s)]
*  But at the end of the day [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1099.64s)]
*  You know Putin controls the Russian Orthodox Church. They've kind of become lackeys of him [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1101.76s)]
*  Yeah, and and their commentary about Ukraine has been pretty bloodthirsty. I think in the past [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1105.8600000000001s)]
*  Let's just say not exactly like the men of the cloth that you and I [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1110.3600000000001s)]
*  Justifying like war crimes, right? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1115.0800000000002s)]
*  so like I think in the short term or medium term even like the best this could do is kind of [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1116.48s)]
*  You know, like you said prisoner exchanges like facilitating kind of [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1122.2s)]
*  humanitarian type agreements between different sides like the notion the Vatican actually brokering like a peace deal like seems pretty [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1127.56s)]
*  Pretty far-fetched to me at this point, but hey, you know, like there's no reason not to try [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1135.0s)]
*  Yeah, I respect the hell out of Pope Francis for trying as you said, he's like 86 years old [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1139.5s)]
*  He just had some health issues. So it's like amazingly he's out there taking these visits. I also saw Ben that [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1144.14s)]
*  There was a Russian oil depot in Crimea that went boom [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1150.28s)]
*  The Ukrainians said that they hit it with the drone [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1155.4399999999998s)]
*  I think in preparation for this spring counter offensive that we've all been waiting for for a while [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1157.84s)]
*  It seems like maybe it'll start in May. Maybe it'll be a summer offensive and it'll slip to June [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1162.4199999999998s)]
*  I mean, I think listening to some military experts [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1166.54s)]
*  It seems like from a Ukrainian perspective the longer they wait the more time they have to get stuff like, you know [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1169.08s)]
*  American tanks and German tanks into the country. So [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1175.0s)]
*  Unfortunately for you know, these peace talk efforts. It seems like we're about to see the war ramp up not ramp down [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1178.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's no way on earth that there's any [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1183.48s)]
*  substantive peace talks before [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1188.6000000000001s)]
*  This Ukrainian offensive. I mean, there's just so much has been building to it so much momentum and the Ukrainians [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1190.68s)]
*  You know, first of all, the Ukrainians are are currently taking a position that they're not gonna negotiate until Russia's completely out of their territory [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1197.3400000000001s)]
*  Right including Crimea. I think at a minimum [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1203.8400000000001s)]
*  There's no way the Ukrainians would want to enter in a negotiation without taking back a pretty good chunk of additional territory [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1206.48s)]
*  That Russia's claimed right so particularly like breaking, you know that land bridge between Eastern Ukraine and Crimea [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1212.48s)]
*  So southern Ukraine around like Mariupol [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1218.1200000000001s)]
*  They're not gonna want to sit down and have peace talks as having lost territory since the Russian invasion [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1220.9s)]
*  So everything is kind of waiting for this offensive [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1227.6s)]
*  I do think like, you know, we you and I were like going back and forth on the Atlantic peace about this where [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1230.54s)]
*  Jeffrey Goldberg and Applebaum sat with [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1238.1000000000001s)]
*  Zolensky and kind of the senior Ukrainian leadership. What was interesting about that is that their rhetoric in that piece was [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1241.46s)]
*  Hey, we're not even a need to take Crimea like they're gonna be these kind of you know [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1247.3400000000001s)]
*  one-off strikes and we're gonna so decisively beat Russia in other places that [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1251.9s)]
*  Crimea will naturally kind of you know fall back into our sovereignty [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1257.5s)]
*  You never know what's disinformation [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1263.86s)]
*  Look, and I don't mean this in like a negative sense like if I was Ukrainians if I was Ukrainians [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1265.86s)]
*  I would be telegraphing that the offensive is coming and precisely the place that it's not, you know [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1270.18s)]
*  Which is what they did last time right? [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1275.56s)]
*  They they said they were gonna do a major offensive in Kyrgyzstan and then they did this lightning offensive in the north around Kharkiv [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1277.08s)]
*  I only say that to make the point that like we don't know whether Crimea is in their crosshairs right now or not [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1282.94s)]
*  And they have every reason and I support it to kind of confuse us all about what they're gonna do [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1289.46s)]
*  That's funny. You said that I've not read that long Atlantic peace yet because it's it's hefty [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1294.7s)]
*  But I had the same thought I had the same thought when I saw them say [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1299.66s)]

*  Is this a real deal? Is this just hitting supplies? Like, I don't know. We'll all find out very very soon [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1307.42s)]

*  what's in it for them is [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1689.16s)]
*  you don't get that many moments to try to like break through and connect with the public and so [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1690.64s)]
*  how this goes how [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1696.8400000000001s)]
*  Charles comports himself how you know Harry whether he shows up and talks to his brother like everybody's gonna watch all this stuff really closely [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1699.16s)]
*  Let's just say that if they screw this up like they don't get another shot at it [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1707.3600000000001s)]
*  You know I actually think there's like some stakes involved here. Yeah, not until his funeral [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1710.96s)]
*  It is imagine just being your Australian [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1714.8600000000001s)]
*  You're like one day you wake up and now King Charles is the head of state for Australia. You're like wait what how are we still doing? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1716.66s)]
*  This what's happening this guy's the head of state [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1722.48s)]
*  I mean look I and it's no disrespect to Charles. He's like you know has admirable qualities, but like I [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1724.8s)]
*  I keep looking like the the British pounds. I have like Queen Elizabeth all over the money [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1730.36s)]
*  I'm like is is Charles gonna be on all this money like how are people gonna feel about that like yeah [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1734.84s)]
*  How are people in Canada and Australia gonna feel about him being the head of state? [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1740.28s)]
*  I mean I really do and again [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1743.32s)]
*  It's not a shot at this guy and the Queen had some other stuff going for [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1745.72s)]
*  Above all that she'd kind of been around forever [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1749.16s)]
*  I do wonder whether more Commonwealth countries are gonna go you know the the way of their own exit [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1751.92s)]
*  Yeah, not brexit, but like a monarchy exit. I think we might see [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1759.52s)]
*  You know the next five years or so some more countries be like yeah [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1764.24s)]
*  Yeah, we might move to not have the moniker of the UK be our for sure Ben [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1767.1200000000001s)]
*  So speaking of the royal family I noticed that there was a recent court filing where Prince Harry [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1773.48s)]
*  Alleged that Rupert Murdoch's British newspaper group had paid quotes a huge sum of money to Prince William back in [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1779.3600000000001s)]
*  2020 to settle a cell phone hacking case presumably of William's phone at some point along the way [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1787.04s)]
*  Harry's bringing this case against the Sun newspaper and other tabloids for hacking into his voicemail at some point [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1793.52s)]
*  Listeners might recall that back in the day [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1800.3600000000001s)]
*  The Sun hacked and released voicemail messages between Prince Charles and his then mistress Camilla Parker Bowles [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1802.36s)]
*  When they were having an affair I will spare you the details of some of the most atrocious [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1809.6s)]
*  Awkward dirty talk you've ever heard but don't go history of humanity [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1815.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean you know rereading it. I was just like Jesus Christ. I wrote it out, and I deleted it [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1819.76s)]
*  It was interesting to read about that case [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1825.1999999999998s)]
*  Knowing that he's going to the to the coronation and then to read a report in Semaphore that [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1827.8s)]
*  Rupert Murdoch had called the Ukrainian president Vladimir Zelensky earlier this year [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1833.6399999999999s)]
*  Lachlan Murdoch spoke to Zelensky too. There was some speculation [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1838.24s)]
*  About whether he discussed Tucker Carlson's views on the war if that got him fired Semaphore said they did not but anyway [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1842.04s)]
*  The whole thing was just it was weird. It was a throwback. What's old is new again Murdoch's in the news just odd [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1847.3999999999999s)]
*  First of all the the whole concept that they like basically is a business model like hacking the people's voicemails is insane [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1854.4s)]
*  Like that's just something like you know like a lot of the ugliness in British media [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1861.92s)]
*  Thanks to Rupert Murdoch has like crossed the pond over here to the US [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1866.6000000000001s)]
*  but like like that not not that I'm aware of in the hacking voicemail thing, but like the [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1869.6000000000001s)]
*  Zelensky thing did jump out to me and [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1877.0800000000002s)]
*  It's the kind of thing that like drives me fucking crazy about Rupert Murdoch and Lachlan Murdoch as the kind of you know [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1880.08s)]
*  Kendall Roy CEO bros [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1887.84s)]
*  in charge now because every now and then you'll see these stories like oh Rupert Murdoch didn't like you know Trump's election denials and [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1890.72s)]
*  Rupert Murdoch's uncomfortable with like, you know the stance that people on Fox again Ukraine [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1898.3999999999999s)]
*  Well, like you fucking own Fox News, bro [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1903.52s)]
*  So like if you really wanted to change this [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1907.0s)]
*  Like you could do something other than calling Zelensky and telling him like you're with him, right? [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1909.8s)]
*  Like what would be more important is the lens key and Ukrainians is to not let a bunch of like America first like nativist [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1913.6000000000001s)]
*  xenophobic [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1921.04s)]
*  isolationist garbage be on your airways all day and like sure firing Tucker Carlson's like a first step [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1922.08s)]
*  But we all know that's like a drop in the bucket of what needs to happen to Fox [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1927.84s)]
*  So like the fact that I know the fact that Murdoch felt compelled enough to like join the kind of cavalcade of [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1931.6s)]
*  Celebrities and CEOs who like go kiss the Zelensky ring tells you that he felt kind of peer pressure in his own circles [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1938.8799999999999s)]
*  To like do this outreach, but I don't for a minute think that it means that Rupert Murdoch would ever put [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1945.6s)]
*  Ukrainian sovereignty and lives over his bottom line, you know, yeah [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1952.08s)]
*  No, I I totally agree. It was just a very strange conflict events [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1956.9s)]
*  I wonder what more we're gonna learn if Prince Harry goes through with this case because it seems like [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1960.84s)]
*  Harry's in a place where he's not looking for a big settlement. He's looking to punish these papers. I [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1965.52s)]
*  Have to say like if there's something you have to say for Harry like he's just willing to burn it all down [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1969.9599999999998s)]
*  You know, and I do think his rage is like well targeted at the uglier aspects of tabloid media [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1973.76s)]
*  Yeah, you know like and if I were advising him what I'd say to is like don't like focus [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1981.6799999999998s)]
*  Don't attack the entire media, you know, like because sometimes he slips into this like [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1987.9199999999998s)]
*  Everybody who's in the in the media everybody who's a journalist like is like in his crosshairs like no pick the egregious examples of [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=1993.04s)]
*  tabloid filth like voicemail hackers and just go all in against those guys, you know [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2001.36s)]
*  because he'll get the attention if he does it and [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2007.24s)]
*  Hopefully it can curb the excesses in like what is legitimately a gross tabloid culture in the UK disgusting tabloid culture [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2010.36s)]
*  So Ben Turkey has a presidential and parliamentary elections coming up on May 14th [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2017.8s)]
*  President type Erdogan is hoping for a coronation like his buddy King Charles [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2023.3999999999999s)]
*  But he's facing a tough challenge from this kind of low-key opposition candidate named Kamal Kilikster Ulu [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2027.84s)]
*  Erdogan is facing general political headwinds that are pretty serious [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2035.12s)]
*  Turkey was hit with this catastrophic earthquake in February. The government response was abysmal that came on top of runaway inflation [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2039.12s)]
*  That reached as high as 85% in Turkey [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2046.48s)]
*  Erdogan has been around he's been president since 2014. He was prime minister from 2003 to 2014 [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2049.7599999999998s)]
*  He was the mayor of Istanbul in the late 90s. So he's like been the face of Turkish politics for a very long time [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2055.52s)]
*  He owns these political problems in a big way and the coalition of opposition parties that oppose him [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2062.08s)]
*  argued that he has harmed Turkey's democracy in the economy by basically being an authoritarian and [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2068.2s)]
*  They want to they have promised to return Turkey to a parliamentary system and undo this power grab Erdogan [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2073.36s)]
*  Executed in 2018 to give himself more more control. So, you know, these two candidates are very different Erdogan [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2079.96s)]
*  He's like, you know been this on the scene for decades in power. He's seen as authoritarian [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2086.84s)]
*  He's pissed off a bunch of other countries in the region by supporting Islamist parties [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2092.46s)]
*  Kilish to rule is this former economist kind of low-key guy with a record of as a corruption fighter [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2096.84s)]
*  who's trying to hold together a [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2102.2999999999997s)]
*  Weird motley diverse coalition of these six opposition parties if elected. He's promised only to serve one term [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2104.66s)]
*  So obviously this election is important for Turkey's future. It's important for NATO. It's potentially important for the European Union [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2111.4599999999996s)]
*  On Sunday Erdogan announced that Turkey's intelligence forces had killed the leader of ISIS in Syria. This was very random and weird [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2118.06s)]
*  You know, he made this announcement after being off the campaign trail for a few days with some illness [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2125.4199999999996s)]
*  He described his stomach flu, but then you know this opposition coalition reminds me a little bit of the unsuccessful effort to [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2129.72s)]
*  Defeat Viktor Orban in Hungary. Yes. Yes. Okay [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2137.0s)]
*  How are you feeling about the odds of this of this Erdogan losing here? [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2140.2799999999997s)]
*  No, that's so interesting you said that because there are a lot of commonalities, right? [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2144.12s)]
*  So the Hungarian opposition decided to pull all the parties behind one person and the person they chose was kind of yeah low-key [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2147.3599999999997s)]
*  Like not a not a hugely charismatic figure it was more like let's return to democracy [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2154.96s)]
*  Let's return to normalcy and that that seemed like an interesting idea and it it totally didn't work [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2160.6s)]
*  and and so here I [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2168.08s)]
*  Guess the bet is like Erdogan has been around for even longer than Viktor Orban, right? [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2171.4s)]
*  So the bet may be that there's just more fatigue with Erdogan [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2175.92s)]
*  Keep in mind that like the structural challenges to the system that this guy's talking about like the return to democracy [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2179.88s)]
*  Erdogan came up as prime minister back when being prime minister used to be the most powerful role in the Turkish government [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2186.28s)]
*  He then changed the Constitution essentially to make the presidency the most powerful office when he became president [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2192.2400000000002s)]
*  And so he's completely rigged this system to suit himself [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2199.2s)]
*  And he's like caused like there's a little bit more negative impact on [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2202.44s)]
*  Ordinary Turks and even Hungarians have experienced in the sense that like there's just been this insane runaway inflation [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2207.6s)]
*  Largely because of mismanagement. This isn't like the normal European cost of living crisis [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2213.84s)]
*  This is like everyone doing crazy shit with the economy. So I guess the bet is Erdogan is more autocratic [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2219.08s)]
*  He's been around for longer people are more tired of him [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2225.1600000000003s)]
*  The economy's really in the shitter and if we just have this kind of guy that can unite these different factions [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2228.32s)]
*  Present himself as like basically the opposite of Erdogan. He's not a cult of personality [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2235.92s)]
*  He's like a more reserved personality who will return things to democracy [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2240.32s)]
*  Did that might pull things together and and like this keep in mind like this is a coalition that's gonna include everybody from kind of [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2243.7200000000003s)]
*  like the Istanbul [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2250.6400000000003s)]
*  cosmopolitan types to like Kurdish voters who are like [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2252.8s)]
*  Obviously turned off by Erdogan's approach in those areas [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2257.2s)]
*  You know, it's worth a shot [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2261.56s)]
*  I do I kind of just feel like the the hungry example which kind of [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2263.3999999999996s)]
*  Sits in my mind just because we followed that election closely is like you might want a little more [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2268.8399999999997s)]
*  Kind of charisma and energy from the opposition like, you know a little more vision [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2274.12s)]
*  articulated for the future but [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2280.04s)]
*  It's gonna be a real choice for Turks, I mean they they can see where everyone's leading them. It's not great [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2281.96s)]
*  There's this person basically pledging to like unite the rest of the country who are not Erdogan dead-enders [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2288.4s)]
*  In a return to democracy and you know, it'll be a real test [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2296.32s)]
*  I mean the test one is does Erdogan allow for a free election or we see kind of incidents of fraud or [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2299.48s)]
*  intimidation or efforts to control the outcome [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2306.6800000000003s)]
*  Then the second thing is just like whether this kind of message can work, you know [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2309.24s)]
*  Because it didn't work in Hungary, but obviously Turkey's quite different country than hungry [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2312.56s)]
*  Yeah, fingers crossed and we'll be watching this one our next couple weeks [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2316.9199999999996s)]
*  a few more updates been on the the hundreds of documents leaked onto the social media site discord by an [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2319.52s)]
*  International guardsman named Jack Tishara [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2326.52s)]
*  So we now have learned that to share his job in that the job of about 1200 people on his base in [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2328.3599999999997s)]
*  Massachusetts was to support the Pentagon's drone programs around the world a bunch of outlets did deep dives into [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2335.68s)]
*  To share his job and how the military drone program has expanded since 9-eleven where there were about I think 200 drones in service in [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2343.92s)]
*  2001 to [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2351.48s)]
*  11,000 in the US military in 2019 when Tishara joined and how the Air National Guard units like the 102nd Fighter Wing in [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2353.08s)]
*  Massachusetts now are like more actively in support of that drone program [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2360.4s)]
*  So in short 9-eleven and the global war on terror is why Tishara had access to the materials that he leaked [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2364.78s)]
*  We know that for sure [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2371.1400000000003s)]
*  In terms of the reporting on the leaked documents themselves [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2372.82s)]
*  The Washington Post ran a piece about how the US found evidence that the Chinese government's [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2376.0600000000004s)]
*  Continuing construction on a military facility in the United Arab Emirates [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2381.1000000000004s)]
*  Despite the UAE claiming to have halted it because of US concerns [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2385.7400000000002s)]
*  This information was part of this like I think a broader Intel report on China's efforts to build military bases overseas [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2389.58s)]
*  The concern is that you know China could use these installations to monitor interfere with US naval movements or whatever [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2396.54s)]
*  I think the Chinese respond like hey you guys have hundreds of bases abroad. We're trying to have like five [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2402.98s)]
*  Can everyone chill out, please? But anyway, no surprise there, but then [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2407.3799999999997s)]
*  Stepping back like it is fascinating to me how often the UAE is popping up in these leaks so far [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2411.14s)]
*  The reputation that the UAE has bought in Washington with investments [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2417.1s)]
*  By buying lots of arms by having kind of a glitzy ambassador who knows everyone at Morning Joe [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2421.8999999999996s)]
*  And throws parties. It's very different than the reality that's being laid out in these documents is notable [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2428.7s)]
*  I'd say so [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2435.8599999999997s)]
*  I mean first of all the drone thing is is [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2437.3799999999997s)]
*  Interesting because to me like it explains a lot and you're right like there's a war on terror origin story here [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2439.4599999999996s)]
*  And just to be clear like not all these drones are like the drones that people have in their minds that take out terrorists [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2444.7s)]
*  I mean we do a ton of you know surveillance reconnaissance in the air drones [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2450.96s)]
*  Yeah, most are unarmed, but I still like don't understand why [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2456.18s)]
*  That would require this guy to be like reading [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2459.82s)]
*  Essentially general Milley's briefing book so it's just still like feels like an unanswered question to me [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2462.82s)]
*  There's just got to be a way to compartmentalize these systems [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2467.7599999999998s)]
*  but the UAE thing is like super noteworthy to me because [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2470.38s)]
*  Part of what again we are learning from these leaked documents is what are the priorities of the US intelligence community and [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2474.34s)]
*  Those priorities reflect things that they're seeing they're like worry them [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2480.62s)]
*  You know like so back when I was an intelligence consumer you were an intelligence consumer [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2484.82s)]
*  Like if something you could kind of tell something was wrong somewhere if you started to get like a lot of intelligence reports about it [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2489.06s)]
*  It's like this is their way of warning you like hey [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2494.62s)]
*  This is not going in the right direction and everything we've seen from this UAE stuff is [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2496.98s)]
*  Suggesting that they're just not on the level you know that because it's a Chinese building [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2502.2200000000003s)]
*  It's a Chinese building a military installation. It's the Russians thinking they can literally enlist the Emirati's to their side [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2508.26s)]
*  in spying on the United States [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2515.1000000000004s)]
*  like these are not like small deviations from Washington foreign policy and [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2517.7000000000003s)]
*  We pointed this out before [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2522.98s)]
*  But like the point is there's a massive influence operation from the Emirati's on the American [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2524.94s)]
*  Establishment and the American elite and it's every faction of that elite right so it's American businesses [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2531.34s)]
*  That like investments from the Emirati sovereign wealth fund and the fact that the Emirati's are liquid [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2537.54s)]
*  They can put a lot of money in all kinds of things [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2542.7400000000002s)]
*  It's the American national security establishment that you know when people are out of government [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2545.02s)]
*  They do lucrative consulting gigs for the Emirati's or they do lucrative speaking gigs in the Emirates [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2550.14s)]
*  And it's as you point out like go look at like the history of you know [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2555.42s)]
*  Who is spotted in political playbook you will find the Emirati ambassador in Washington? [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2560.3399999999997s)]
*  frequently in [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2567.14s)]
*  You know cafe Milano [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2568.54s)]
*  You know like the always gross Georgetown hangout of the Washington elite or like throwing birthday parties for like American media personalities [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2570.14s)]
*  Or I'm sure he was all over the Washington Correspondence Center and like there's just such a coziness and chumminess [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2579.44s)]
*  between the American establishment the Emirati's and [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2586.36s)]
*  Meanwhile underneath the hood while that's happening [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2589.1200000000003s)]
*  like there's there the Chinese are building like military bases or at least what could become military bases and [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2592.32s)]
*  And the Russians feel like they have a potential partner in the Emirati's like something is happening here [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2598.96s)]
*  The intelligence community seem to be trying to warn policymakers of this and it will be interesting to see like what becomes of [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2604.3599999999997s)]
*  This information being public or whether it just kind of conveniently gets kind of you know cast aside [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2613.24s)]
*  By people in Washington who don't want to believe that the Emirati's or anything other than you know [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2618.7999999999997s)]
*  the people that throw nice parties and say the right things and [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2624.52s)]
*  You know like we we build up into these close [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2628.72s)]
*  partners now I [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2633.38s)]
*  remind me of a funny story I was like so bad at interacting with that kind of like [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2635.38s)]
*  Cool more adult class of people that I actually got seated like one of the years [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2639.98s)]
*  I went to the White House Correspondence Center is like 2010 [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2643.98s)]
*  I think me and Favreau went with like Politico we were at that we happen to be at the same table [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2645.94s)]
*  And I think we were supposed to be seated around [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2650.14s)]
*  Yousef al-attiba the ambassador of the UAE and we switched the place cards [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2653.3s)]
*  We can like sit on our own in the corner and just like slam drinks instead of talking to this guy [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2658.3s)]
*  Which is a very childish thing to do [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2663.5s)]
*  But I don't regret it especially because he was he was hugely like I mean I said to you said didn't like I got to [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2665.1s)]
*  Know did not like about but I remember saying them like one point [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2670.66s)]
*  So I think this is an important point like I kind of don't blame him right like that's his job [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2673.06s)]
*  He's very good at his job. Yeah, I said to him once I think you're like you're because I used to get these arguments [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2677.94s)]
*  I'm like you're doing your job and you're doing really well like it's on us [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2683.54s)]
*  It's on Americans like of course foreign ambassadors want to come here and like get build influence, right? [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2687.1s)]
*  So this is like ultimately this comes back to whether like people in Washington care more about like, you know [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2691.94s)]
*  Preserving a certain social scene and then they care about national interests [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2698.2599999999998s)]
*  I know well so people the press career obviously kind of takes the bait on blaming the US for like other countries foreign policy decisions [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2702.34s)]
*  So like this Washington Post story included this graph an Emirati political analyst said the UAE began exploring other [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2708.18s)]
*  Security partners after what the nation saw as America's slow response to missile attacks against Abu Dhabi by Iranian backed Houthi rebels in Yemen [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2713.54s)]
*  And it's like guys you by all means head your bets [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2720.22s)]
*  You know like you're going with the Chinese going with the Russians if you want UAE [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2722.94s)]
*  But China's not gonna fight your fucking war in Yemen for you [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2726.46s)]
*  So I don't know what you think this quote does to advance the story [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2729.46s)]
*  Well, and before that it was the Iran deal and before that it was like Mubarak and Egypt like there's always something that it's the US's [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2732.7s)]
*  Faults that like are we were forcing the royal family of the Emirates to become autocratic? [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2739.46s)]
*  you know, that's like they always have been like they just [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2745.78s)]
*  so yeah, I like the blame America for [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2749.7400000000002s)]
*  What other countries choose to do thing, you know? [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2753.54s)]
*  Always greats in even more so in this it's a little much. Let's just allow every country some agency [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2757.1s)]
*  One alliance it seems pretty solid at the moment then is the US and South Korea [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2762.1s)]
*  So President Biden welcome President Yoon of South Korea to the White House last week for a state visit [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2765.98s)]
*  The key deliverable from their meeting was basically to reaffirm the US security guarantee for South Korea in the face of [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2770.34s)]
*  Continued North Korean aggression than their nuclear program and their missile program, etc [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2777.6600000000003s)]
*  And there was a specific promise for more consultation with South Korea about strategy on nuclear weapons use [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2781.5s)]
*  Which was billed as this big deliverable and I'm like, yeah, I guess but like I would hope we wouldn't nuke the shared peninsula [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2788.86s)]
*  They live on talking to the to the rocks first [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2795.9s)]
*  But anyway, um, it's a hell of a lot better than developing nukes on their own [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2799.26s)]
*  I guess but yes, so this seems like a bit of a repackaging of current policy [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2802.46s)]
*  But what stole the show in Washington was when President Yoon took the mic at the state dinner and decided to sing [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2807.2000000000003s)]
*  Here's a clip [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2814.82s)]
*  February made me sure [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2816.82s)]
*  really paper I deliver [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2819.06s)]
*  Bad news on the doorstep I couldn't talk one more step I [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2822.02s)]
*  Can't remember if I tried when I [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2828.74s)]
*  rather bowries we go bright [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2832.34s)]
*  Something touched me deep inside [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2836.1s)]
*  the day the music [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2839.42s)]
*  I [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2841.82s)]
*  Can't imagine having the guts to grab the mic in front of the president United States a bunch of fucking fancy people at a state [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2848.98s)]
*  Dinner essentially go acapella until the Marine band kind of comes in with a little bit of keys to help now [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2856.1400000000003s)]
*  It's singing American pie there. But apparently it's his favorite song Biden gave him a signed guitar. I don't know gutsy move [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2861.7400000000002s)]
*  I mean, there's a great karaoke culture in South Korea. Let's be clear. Oh, yeah, you and I have participated in it [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2868.42s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, like certain night in Yokohama comes to mind and where was it 2010? [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2874.2200000000003s)]
*  and [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2879.66s)]
*  I just want to say though that like [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2881.02s)]
*  Look, I like American pie as much as the next guy. I'm not sure that that's that's not my karaoke go-to [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2884.62s)]
*  Slow no energy there, you know, like he's not like [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2889.86s)]
*  It's not energy and there's not like irony right because when I go slow karaoke I go like [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2893.46s)]
*  Greatest love of all by Whitney Houston and like patience by Guns N Roses. Yeah, I mean the guy has some game [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2897.94s)]
*  I mean, he's got pipes. I listen. Yeah, Don McLean is [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2903.7400000000002s)]
*  You know singular person in terms of songwriting, but that was a pretty good rendition. I thought [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2908.2200000000003s)]
*  He hung in there for at a state I certainly never saw anything quite like that [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2914.7400000000002s)]
*  The only time I saw something kind of that crazy was at the [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2918.2799999999997s)]
*  ASEAN dinner in Indonesia in 2011 when Quincy Jones got up and saying [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2924.04s)]
*  We are the world and invited Obama and the Chinese premier to join him on stage and singing that remember that and [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2930.08s)]
*  And let's just say they didn't get on stage. But look, I mean to be serious for a moment like that [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2937.3599999999997s)]
*  This stuff matters the symbolism of seven years of the South Korean Alliance [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2943.24s)]
*  There's always political division in South Korea about the Alliance or people there that kind of don't like the heavy [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2946.36s)]
*  You know the heavy footprint of the US military [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2953.76s)]
*  People there that obviously like feel like China is right next door and maybe we should be drawing closer to them [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2957.1200000000003s)]
*  And so like you you constantly have to tend to this alliance and [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2965.2000000000003s)]
*  It was important to have that kind of state visit [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2970.1600000000003s)]
*  It was important to have that kind of state visit I do agree with you like the the nuclear thing felt kind of like [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2972.52s)]
*  you know, we [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2979.3599999999997s)]
*  Named you know, we kind of put a label on something that we already do right? [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2981.68s)]
*  We just consult with them about nuclear use in the Korean peninsula. What I take away from that is [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2986.04s)]
*  two things one as you reference like a slight concern that if the South Koreans feel like [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2992.2s)]
*  They can't really count on us and they don't know where this is going and people like Trump are crazy and [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=2999.36s)]
*  That maybe they could get their own nuclear weapons, which technologically they could probably figure out how to do pretty fast [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3004.6800000000003s)]
*  And so I think this was an effort to try to like mitigate those [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3009.7200000000003s)]
*  impulses in South Korea and also just like a sense that like [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3013.6800000000003s)]
*  You know, there's an understanding that in South Korea [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3018.52s)]
*  People are looking at this and thinking [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3022.44s)]
*  You know is this the best long-term bet for us or should we make our own kind of deals with China, you know [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3024.8s)]
*  And right now you have a conservative [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3030.52s)]
*  President South Korea all the an unpopular one [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3033.6s)]
*  But I think it's smart to try to like hug them as tight as we can and and I think we should [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3036.28s)]
*  Substantively consult more with them on all this stuff. So there's a feeling of equal partnership in the in the relationship [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3041.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3046.62s)]
*  I mean look it's pretty good a little life hack there from President you and if you're going to Washington and you're deliverable is some scary [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3046.84s)]
*  nuke thing and [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3054.0s)]
*  All the questions coming in or about why the Americans spied on you so much you just started singing and that's all that [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3055.56s)]
*  I'm gonna focus on that's a story [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3060.6s)]
*  That's exactly right. The person who could have taken this advice Ben is Rhonda Santis who has been traveling abroad [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3062.84s)]
*  It has not gone great. So [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3069.92s)]
*  Politico interviewed some business leaders who went to a dinner. He attended with him in London. Here are some of the quotes [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3072.16s)]
*  He definitely looked spent but his message wasn't presidential [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3079.12s)]
*  He was horrendous one said it was low wattage and that nobody in the room was left thinking this man is going places [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3082.38s)]
*  It felt a bit like we were watching a state-level politician [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3089.02s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised if people came out thinking that's not the guy there wasn't any stardust [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3092.1s)]
*  it felt like the end of an overseas trip, which it was so [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3096.92s)]
*  You and I talked last week about Ron's specific itinerary like why do you go to Japan South Korea the UK and Israel? [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3102.06s)]
*  Technically it was called a trade mission, but everyone knows he was campaigning my question today is [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3108.78s)]
*  After watching this thing is is the juice worth the squeeze on these trips? [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3114.14s)]
*  I mean to the extent anyone is talking about this trip. It was the weird reaction he had in Japan [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3118.86s)]
*  It was how bad this meeting was in the UK. It was how pissy he seemed at the press conference in Israel [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3124.66s)]
*  There's now a big controversy in Florida about who the hell paid for his flights because he won't release [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3131.02s)]
*  The donors who paid for this private charter flight he took which must have cost like half a million to a million dollars [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3137.58s)]
*  So I like I obviously care a lot about foreign policy like I think when you're running for president [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3143.58s)]
*  It's actually unquestionably though the place where you have the most freedom to act so we should really vet these things [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3148.22s)]
*  But if I was advising a candidate, I don't think I would advise them to go overseas [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3153.8599999999997s)]
*  I'm just like not sure it's worth it. Where do you where do you land? [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3157.98s)]
*  Definitely not I mean first of all like for him to like whiff in the UK like that [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3162.18s)]
*  I mean he was meeting with like business leaders like these people want Rhonda Santis to be good [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3165.74s)]
*  The reason those quotes matters like these people are basically Republicans. It's your base. Yeah, you know, yeah, there's base [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3170.9799999999996s)]
*  There's like rich British banker type guys, right? [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3176.8199999999997s)]
*  They don't like Trump [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3179.22s)]
*  They think Trump is weird and a little crazy and like what they feel uncomfortable about America about but Rhonda Santis [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3180.2999999999997s)]
*  These guys desperately wanted him to be good [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3185.66s)]
*  they want like a [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3187.9799999999996s)]
*  You know more country club kind of Republican that they recognize show up and tell them it's all gonna be okay [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3188.8599999999997s)]
*  We'll just cut taxes and regulations like we used to and the fact that he fucking with this hard [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3193.82s)]
*  With like what should be his like base like in the entire world [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3198.6600000000003s)]
*  Rhonda Santis is base should be a bunch of like Eden educated Oxbridge educated rich white guys in London [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3202.34s)]
*  You know and like the fact that these guys are like just like throwing haymakers at him after he was there [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3209.44s)]
*  Like he must have just totally fucked it up and you're right about these trips [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3214.78s)]
*  I mean again, like this is a bit of a Obama derangement syndrome because [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3218.6800000000003s)]
*  There wasn't really a tradition of like candidates going on foreign trips like this high-profile [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3223.86s)]
*  And then Obama kind of crushed it in 2008 [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3229.6000000000004s)]
*  I mean, I'm here Tommy like I said like I can throw a rock and and and [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3232.98s)]
*  Hit the place where like two hundred and fifty thousand Germans were in the streets and he was meeting with foreign leaders [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3237.1800000000003s)]
*  And that was like undeniably like a boost to him and you've seen these Republicans try to replicate this Mitt Romney [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3242.7200000000003s)]
*  Disastrously like flubbing his way through the UK and Israel and Poland like up to DeSantis like I don't I don't get what these people think [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3251.06s)]
*  They're achieving there. They're like playing at being president. They're like, you know, maybe they want to go see BB in Israel [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3258.98s)]
*  But you could just meet BB when he comes to the US [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3264.7799999999997s)]
*  like I don't I have no idea what the hell Rhonda Santis is thinking like other than the fact that Rhonda Santis seems to [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3267.04s)]
*  Look in the mirror and see president to Santis and apparently nobody else really does [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3272.58s)]
*  And like DeSantis even in Israel kind of rolled into a giant [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3276.8599999999997s)]
*  Constitutional crisis. I think Kevin McCarthy is there now [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3281.02s)]
*  Undercutting Joe Biden saying it's disgusting that he hasn't invited BB Nitanyahu to Washington yet [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3284.06s)]
*  And like which is absurd given what they're going through. Um, and even but even that Obama trip, which I think [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3289.12s)]
*  unquestionably went well the minute we got back the [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3295.46s)]
*  The McCain campaign greeted us with this big ad campaign comparing Barack Obama to Paris Hilton and calling him a celebrity [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3300.22s)]
*  Who likes, you know needs big crowds and it like I don't think it was a good attack [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3306.7s)]
*  But it reframed the debate it got in our heads, you know [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3312.1s)]
*  No, that's right. It kind of worked like for them [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3315.5s)]
*  It kind of blunted the momentum and but just even that goes straight like Obama executed that trip like and I wouldn't say this about [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3318.1s)]
*  Everything we did like he didn't make any mistakes and he basically got endorsed by multiple world leaders [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3324.1s)]
*  And he gave a speech to 250,000 people and even that they're like McCain campaign [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3329.3799999999997s)]
*  You're right like he's the world's biggest celebrity, but is he ready to lead? [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3333.54s)]
*  I remember that was the ad and it kind of like the press was ready for that narrative [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3337.5s)]
*  They're like, oh, yeah, why was he out of the country? Like I don't get these trips [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3341.58s)]
*  I other than placating the size of these guys egos like I don't I don't really know what they're accomplishing [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3345.06s)]
*  I don't either. I don't either. Yeah, you're right. I do think it sort of boils down to like [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3350.98s)]
*  Looking in the mirror and seeing a president and deciding that the way to do that is to be on the world stage [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3354.9s)]
*  on a Florida trade mission [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3359.06s)]
*  Well, did you notice like Trump years like the Trump family seemed to kind of like their favorite part of being president was like [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3361.74s)]
*  Just like knowing these were leaders, you know, like Jared Navonka would show up at all these summits for certain [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3368.34s)]
*  Trump loves to this day [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3372.58s)]
*  Trump is still talking about how top of the line all these autocratic buddies of his were like there's something like see for all the Republicans [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3374.22s)]
*  Xenophobia, there's some weird, you know [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3380.34s)]
*  Complex about foreign leaders and stuff that like get like more than Democrats [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3383.02s)]
*  They get they get like a little too excited about [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3387.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, little too excited Ben. Thanks again. What time is it in Germany right now like 1030 p.m. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3391.76s)]
*  It's 1030 and I like I try to bring my highest energy [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3397.7200000000003s)]
*  But like it's 1030 and I don't even know like what time I technically woke up this morning [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3401.44s)]
*  But like it's nicer you seem shockingly awake to me if we're being honest [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3406.1200000000003s)]
*  And if I were you I would go get another pint [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3410.9s)]
*  I'm gonna get a pint and you know, like I'm like riding the high of like seeing young [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3412.72s)]
*  I mean I like to be serious for a moment [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3418.3599999999997s)]
*  like it's pretty cool to meet like activists and people running for office and and people [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIm4LUpvKEI&t=3421.3599999999997s)]
