# Israel is on The Brink of Democratic Catastrophe... How Did We Get Here?
**Pod Save the World:** [May 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk)
*  Welcome back to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Ben Rhodes. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2.0s)]
*  Max Fisher. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2.88s)]
*  Back in the studio, the three of us for a special bonus episode of Pod Save the World [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3.84s)]
*  to talk about a very special topic, the roots of the judicial crisis in Israel that has led to [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=9.28s)]
*  massive protests, societal upheaval, and a lot of hand-wringing in this studio, I will say. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  The quick backstory on what's happening is Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu is trying to jam through [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=20.64s)]
*  changes to Israel's judicial system that would essentially strip away its independence [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=24.88s)]
*  and allow the coalition running the government to control judicial appointments and give the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=29.52s)]
*  Knesset, Israel's parliament, the power to override Supreme Court rulings that find laws [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=34.16s)]
*  passed by the Knesset unconstitutional. For reasons we'll explain in a second, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=39.36s)]
*  that is a massive change in Israel's system. But today we just want to step back a bit and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=44.32s)]
*  not necessarily talk about the headlines of the day, but examine some of the deeper structural [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=50.16s)]
*  forces that got Israel onto the brink of this crisis. Those structural forces include unresolved [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  questions about the founding identity of Israel, Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu himself and sort of [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=60.72s)]
*  how he's a singular individual in the country's history, and then the U.S.-Israel relationship. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=66.24s)]
*  So, Max, over to you. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=71.6s)]
*  So, I think nothing brought about this conversation at all. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=73.36s)]
*  Yeah, right. Yeah, it's easy stuff. Just rip a little, we'll put it out. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=76.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=80.96s)]
*  Not a big deal. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=81.44s)]
*  Bonus episode, yeah. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=82.0s)]
*  I'm glad we're talking, because I know it's something that we all think about a lot. We [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=83.2s)]
*  see each other in the hallways and talk about this. The future of Israeli democracy, I think, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=86.64s)]
*  is a really live question. And the future of the Palestinians and the future of the relationship, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=90.48s)]
*  it's a really live question that I think really demands a lot of scrutiny right now. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  To me, everything that is happening right now, this big threat to Israeli democracy, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  all traces back to this unanswered question from the country's founding in 1948, which is, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=104.4s)]
*  are we a democracy, or are we a state of and for one group in particular? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=110.8s)]
*  And the country's founders were very aware of this tension. They knew that the democratic world [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=117.36s)]
*  was, as was happening, just then waking up this idea that you can't be a democracy for one group, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  because a democracy for one group will inevitably become a dictatorship of the majority, probably [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=127.92s)]
*  just a dictatorship. But Israel's founders felt they weren't ready to answer that question of [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=133.44s)]
*  what kind of country are we just yet, partly because there was this large population of [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=139.6s)]
*  non-Jews, of Palestinians within Israel. So they never really finished constructing a government. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=144.32s)]
*  Israel has no constitution. There's no Bill of Rights. There are no formal checks and balances, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  because the convention that formed in 1948 to write that constitution couldn't decide how to [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=154.64s)]
*  define who is an Israeli citizen. What is the Israeli state? What are our basic rights? So that [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=160.32s)]
*  convention just converted itself into the Knesset, that legislature, which is still basically the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=164.72s)]
*  entire government. And it's out of that gap where the state was supposed to be that the Israeli [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=169.44s)]
*  Supreme Court, which is at the center of all this, rose up. And it became the main check [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=175.04s)]
*  on the power of the legislature, also gradually defined those basic rights that had never been [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=179.04s)]
*  set by constitution. So it became the main vehicle for advancing the version of Israel that is built [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=183.6s)]
*  on individual rights, liberal institutions, and the like. But this unresolved question of whether [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=191.2s)]
*  Israel is firstly a democracy or firstly a state for one group was still there. And it got heightened [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=196.64s)]
*  in 1967, of course, when Israel conquered the West Bank and Gaza, territories that were supposed to [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=201.67999999999998s)]
*  be Palestine. And it's forgotten now, but there was this moment that I think is really important, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=206.64s)]
*  where the country's founding leader, David Ben-Gurion, came out of retirement when that [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=211.67999999999998s)]
*  happened and said, you have to give these territories up, or it will put such a pressure [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  on that contradiction of Israeli democracy that it will destroy it. And I think he was right, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=219.83999999999997s)]
*  but it was actually this slightly different but related contradiction that has put the Supreme [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=224.0s)]
*  Court at the center of what's happening now. And this starts in the 1990s when the courts began [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=229.04s)]
*  asserting more protections for individual rights, chiefly for women and LGBT people. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=234.88s)]
*  And this is just for Israelis. It's not touching Palestinian rights, but it angers right-wing [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=240.56s)]
*  religious Israelis who feel the court is pushing the country too far away from the traditionalist [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=245.76s)]
*  Jewish identity that they want. And that starts this very familiar story for us Americans here. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=251.6s)]
*  Right. Yeah, exactly. I think this also sounds really great. Or like 20 other countries. Yeah, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=257.12s)]
*  remind him. It reminds me of your book a lot. And it starts this movement to take away the court's [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=261.52s)]
*  power altogether. And in doing so to say, we've decided what kind of country we want to be. We're [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=266.0s)]
*  for one group first, and we are democratic second. And that movement against the courts really takes [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=270.32s)]
*  off in the 2010s, when the Netanyahu government wants to roll back a bunch of basic rights in the [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=275.36s)]
*  name of national security, things like ban foreign NGOs, deport some rights workers. The courts stop [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=280.48s)]
*  him from going further. And that is when the big nationalist, often secular right, joins with the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=285.68s)]
*  smaller religious right and saying, we need to new the court. We need to make the prime minister [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=292.40000000000003s)]
*  all powerful. And that was precisely what Netanyahu was trying to do in March, and to a protest stop [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=295.92s)]
*  him because Israelis know that this court is the foundation of their democracy in a way that it's [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=301.52000000000004s)]
*  not in other systems. But at the same time that Israelis will fight to keep their democracy, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=305.76s)]
*  they have still not really collectively decided what kind of country they want to be. I just [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=312.4s)]
*  reconcile this contradiction that's built into their founding. And you see this in polls. When [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=316.32s)]
*  asked explicitly whether Israel should be democratic first or Jewish first, Israelis used to say both. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=320.48s)]
*  But now they mostly say it has to be one or the other. And the people who say it should be Jewish [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=326.15999999999997s)]
*  first outnumber the people who say it should be democratic first by like two to one. And that to [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=331.28s)]
*  me is kind of the core of all this. And I believe that until Israelis are able to resolve that [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=337.67999999999995s)]
*  question, which is also going to mean addressing the occupation, there's always going to be another [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=344.0s)]
*  crisis in waiting like this. That's like very well laid out. And I mean, I agree with everything you [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=348.0s)]
*  said, Max. I think so I'm here to kind of make the case that BB has been singularly important to this [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=353.67999999999995s)]
*  drift away from democracy. And the Israeli public opinion is both representative of like [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=359.68s)]
*  25 years of BB Nenyo politics as much as it is impacting it. And here's how I describe it. I [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=369.44s)]
*  mean, I really like how you brought Ben-Gurion into this because part of what had happened [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=374.40000000000003s)]
*  since Israel's founding is that periodically, yes, the founding generation was balancing this [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=379.44s)]
*  identity as a democracy along with this identity as a Jewish state. And by the way, there used to [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=384.8s)]
*  be almost like a socialist identity to write the ideology of the kibbutz put that aside. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=390.16s)]
*  But at critical moments, they and usually often late in their careers in the way, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=395.6s)]
*  they would break in the favor of the democracy. Yeah. So if you think about it, you mentioned [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=402.48s)]
*  Ben-Gurion, Rabin, obviously making this this this military leader and hero making this really [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=408.88s)]
*  hard turn towards peace before he's assassinated. Shimon Peres obviously got there pretty early. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=414.32s)]
*  Even, you know, Ariel Sharon, who's an interesting guy to contrast with BB, the hardest ass in Israeli [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=419.52s)]
*  history in some ways, being this guy is like, you know, we got to pull out of Gaza, pull up stakes, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=424.88s)]
*  give up this land in part because we have to accept that to be a democracy in a Jewish state. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=428.96s)]
*  And that's what Nenyo has never been willing to do. And I think you have to understand BB, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=434.56s)]
*  his political scent kind of takes off in that moment after the Oslo court, right? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=440.47999999999996s)]
*  Where Rabin has kind of laid down the marker, we're going to do this. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=444.71999999999997s)]
*  It feels like the momentum is moving in that direction. BB is a part of a really kind of [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=448.32s)]
*  brilliant anti-Rabin anti Oslo campaign. Rabin is assassinated. And I'm not going to go as far as [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=453.28s)]
*  some people say and kind of laying some of that at BB's feet. But he was no doubt a part of the [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=459.28s)]
*  criticism. Right? Yeah, you could. A little bit. You could if you wanted to. But remind listeners [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=463.52s)]
*  who don't know maybe what the Oslo process was. Yeah, the Oslo process basically sets the outlines [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=468.56s)]
*  for a two state solution between the Israelis and Palestinians. And so in mirroring the kind of [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=473.44s)]
*  mutual recognition agreements have been made with Egypt and Jordan, the Palestinians formally [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=478.88s)]
*  recognized Israel, which they had not yet done. The Israelis recognized the Palestinian authority [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=483.04s)]
*  is like the governing authority of the Palestinians. And they made all sorts of agreements to [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=488.8s)]
*  facilitate kind of more autonomy of Palestinians, but also a lot of security control for the [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=495.04s)]
*  Israelis. And they punted on what we call the final status issues. Right. What's the capital? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=500.0s)]
*  Is Jerusalem capital for both? What are the borders? What are the long term security [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=506.32s)]
*  arrangements? What happens to Palestinian refugees? Now, so BB kind of, you know, he gets elected. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=510.32000000000005s)]
*  Rabin gets assassinated. Shimon Peres kind of flames out. He's just not as good a politician. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=516.48s)]
*  BB defeats him. His first 10 years. You know, we see some of what we got familiar with later. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=522.32s)]
*  Didn't get along with the American president, kind of backsliding on Oslo. But it's really when [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=527.7600000000001s)]
*  BB comes back to power in 2009 that I think that he becomes a real accelerant in liberalism in [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=531.6800000000001s)]
*  Israel. And the way I try to think about this is it's not unlike what we've seen with other [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=538.4000000000001s)]
*  authoritarian populists and ethno nationalist populists. Trump, you know, Orban, Bolsonaro. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=543.6s)]
*  It starts as rhetoric and performance. Right. But over time, the rhetoric and performance and the [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=551.12s)]
*  political style and the political kind of pugilism actually become substantive. And this is like my [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=556.16s)]
*  core argument, because I remember going to Israel with Obama for Shimon Peres funeral in 2016. And I [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=562.24s)]
*  was lamenting that Shimon Peres had this huge legacy for Israel, right? Helping to literally [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=568.72s)]
*  build the country and its scientific and military base and probably its nuclear weapon. But what's [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=573.28s)]
*  BB's legacy? You know, oh, yeah, I get to be prime minister forever. And Obama said, well, his [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=579.2s)]
*  legacy is he destroyed the Israeli left. But actually bigger than that, if you step back, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=582.64s)]
*  you know, he comes in and what does he do? Well, he he defends settlements at the same time that [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=588.16s)]
*  that enterprise is growing and that enterprise is making a Palestinian state less and less possible. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=595.04s)]
*  And the same time that settlers are beginning to assert themselves in different ways, like [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=600.24s)]
*  violence against Palestinians. And so suddenly, like the substantive embrace of some settlers [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=603.36s)]
*  over time kind of begins to have a real substantive impact on the map itself and on the nature of [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=608.72s)]
*  Israeli society. You know, he mailed these words about a two state solution, but by the end, he's [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=614.48s)]
*  just against it, basically. But importantly, like his conspiracy theories about NGOs at first, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=619.76s)]
*  they were kind of, you know, we've joked about them, like the the State Department funding, like [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=625.6800000000001s)]
*  Israelis and Palestinians playing basketball, he's blaming his like political interference in the [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=630.08s)]
*  election. But lo and behold, like then that become restrictive laws being introduced against NGOs, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=633.84s)]
*  or he really stressed Jewish identity over democracy and his rhetoric. And yeah, nationality [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=640.72s)]
*  laws start to show up. And suddenly, maybe you can get your citizenship revoked. And he crossed [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=647.44s)]
*  certain taboos and third rails that Israelis, they didn't used to like to talk about the fact that it [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=652.1600000000001s)]
*  actually is already a multi ethnic state without even say the occupied Palestinians. There are a [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=656.96s)]
*  lot of Arabs in Israel. Well, when BB comes out on election day in 2016, and starts talking about [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=661.52s)]
*  the Arabs are voting in droves, as if they're foreigners, as if they're not Israelis, that was [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=666.8s)]
*  a seismic moment. It's like, okay, we're now on the other end of, you know, of somebody saying this [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=671.52s)]
*  and normalizing this. And then we start to see laws that create second classes of citizenship. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=676.88s)]
*  You know, he always was kind of cozy with like the guy who on the newspaper or whatever. But then [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=682.3199999999999s)]
*  it starts to become like actual corruption. Like if you don't report what I want, you might lose [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=687.12s)]
*  your license, right. And so over time, we're seeing rhetoric become laws become like settled [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=691.12s)]
*  political questions. And the frustration he said over time with these really legal systems, same [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=698.88s)]
*  way it started, like it does here, like, activists judges suck, you know, he uses the same kind of [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=704.64s)]
*  rhetoric. And now we're like looking to defang the Supreme Court. So I think he's one of those guys [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=709.76s)]
*  who's kind of, he's fooled a lot of people over the years, because he didn't come out at the [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=714.64s)]
*  beginning and say, I would like to transition Israel to a not a democracy, like Orban did on [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=718.0s)]
*  Hungary. But the effect of everything he's done and unleashed has has brought us there. And once [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=723.04s)]
*  you get to contrast him again with the founding generation, once you get a leader who's willing [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=728.88s)]
*  to put his own political interests over over anything, that's what accelerated this devolution [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=732.96s)]
*  in Israeli democracy. And, and Tommy, leads to the question we're gonna talk about, because the two [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=738.64s)]
*  points I'd say that to tee up the US relationship pieces, this identity question, first of all, is [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=745.04s)]
*  very uncomfortable, because I know how it's for you, Max, in my house, this was a settled question, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=749.76s)]
*  right? Israel was a democracy, and we were super, super proud of it as a Jewish state, but we were [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=754.8s)]
*  more proud because they had built this democracy. And, and so I think a lot of American Jews just [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=760.0799999999999s)]
*  take it as more settled than the poll you cited for me. And they think, what do you mean, this [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=765.8399999999999s)]
*  is a question. And so in a weird way, they were less alarmist about BB, because they thought, well, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=769.8399999999999s)]
*  he can't really destroy Israel's democracy, because that it's, you know, it's, it's, it's kind of [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=773.76s)]
*  written in stone. That's one issue. But the other issue is the extent to which Americans like to [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=778.3199999999999s)]
*  hear, like, whatever shred of an inkling of something BB says, it sounds reasonable, they grab onto and [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=784.16s)]
*  they ignore all the rest of it, you know, he gave one half ass speech about a potential two state [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=790.08s)]
*  solution in some completely impossible future in like 2009. And I can't tell you how many times I [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=794.88s)]
*  heard, you know, as he was killing yet again, another peace process. Well, remember, he took [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=800.16s)]
*  that courageous step in 2009. It's like, no, yeah, he's an interesting guy, because, you know, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=804.64s)]
*  BB, whose brother was killed, the only Israeli commando killed in this daring rescue operation [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=809.68s)]
*  in Uganda in like the 60s. And I think that relationship helped him rise to fame and rise [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=817.52s)]
*  to power. And then I thought the way you laid it out was really interesting in that all his sort [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=824.0s)]
*  of darkest rhetoric becomes policy and sort of corruption spirals. And he creates all these [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=827.84s)]
*  political and legal problems for himself that he has to solve, or has to that he tries to solve by [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=834.1600000000001s)]
*  tacking further and further to the right and getting more power. Yes, you can see this judicial [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=840.0s)]
*  coup as Haaretz calls it as a process to help his coalition pass a law that will make it so he has [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=844.08s)]
*  a get out of jail free card and can't be prosecuted for these laws. Or this judicial coup is an effort [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=850.64s)]
*  to forge a coalition with right wing forces in Israel that previously were seen as completely [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=856.08s)]
*  out of bounds, essentially were viewed as terrorists. But now he needs them as part of his coalition. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=862.64s)]
*  And so he's willing to go to these really dark places and defang the courts to in essence to do [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=867.6s)]
*  the policy bidding of some of these far right groups. And a weird way he's done that to like, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=874.8000000000001s)]
*  and now I'm just going for it to AIPAC, because like, their defenses of Israel and their attacks [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=880.08s)]
*  on Israel's critics have kind of mirrored the increasingly pugilistic politics of [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=890.8s)]
*  Bibi in a way. Part of what you're saying is like, he's kind of just been this gravitational pull [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=899.76s)]
*  towards, but over time, that gravitational pull like fundamentally changes the character of the [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=905.84s)]
*  organization to the point that now AIPAC is doing something it never did before, which is it has a [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=910.32s)]
*  super PAC that's like, literally trying to take out Democrats. Democrats, liberal Democrats. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=914.24s)]
*  Well, but let me ask you about something you said, because I think that it's a really important [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=918.96s)]
*  point you made that Netanyahu has, he started out just opportunistically exploiting these kind of [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=924.08s)]
*  fissures and unanswered questions in Israeli society, and then that ends up becoming reality [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=929.52s)]
*  because he's so effective at widening those divisions, which of course is something you see [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=934.4s)]
*  in like, one country after another, where you see these right wing populists where there's not, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=938.0s)]
*  they don't have like a master playbook for like, here's how I'm going to bring about dictatorship, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=941.92s)]
*  but it just like they take step after step, and then they weaken themselves and they paint [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=946.0799999999999s)]
*  themselves into a corner like Netanyahu has. I think the question that I wrestle with is, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=949.84s)]
*  is it too late to untangle that, to roll that back? This show is sponsored by BetterHelp. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=956.0799999999999s)]
*  How do you balance time for yourself in a given week and time for others? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=960.88s)]
*  I'm gonna say like, exercise fully, me time. So I do that. Let's be honest, you know, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=966.7199999999999s)]
*  when you go to work, like you work in a little bit of time for yourself. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=974.0799999999999s)]

*  I was actually sending a thank you note. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=980.56s)]
*  Oh, that's some you time too. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=983.04s)]
*  To yourself? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=984.48s)]
*  Yeah, I did a little pat on the back. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=985.6s)]
*  Listen, listen to that gratitude. It's so easy to get caught up in what everyone else needs from [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=988.16s)]

*  It feels too late on the Palestinian issue in a lot of ways. Just like there's a territorial [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1302.96s)]
*  problem now like with with the extent of settlements and in terms of Israeli democracy, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1308.1599999999999s)]
*  I think you know part of what he's done, this is Obama's point about destroying the Israeli left, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1314.24s)]
*  is they've not had a leader come along in a long time who's made really really made the alternative [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1319.0400000000002s)]
*  case. You know, they've had, you know, Yar Lapid kind of tried to they all tack to the center and [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1324.24s)]
*  the center has moved to the right. You know, like we've seen this. Beny Gantz was just like, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1331.44s)]
*  breath of fresh air. We've seen this story, right, but and I'm not saying they have to be some kind [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1335.2800000000002s)]
*  of left-wing progressive but we have just not seen a charismatic, compelling Israeli political figure [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1339.0400000000002s)]
*  really challenge this narrative of kind of like we don't care if we have to become more authoritarian [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1346.48s)]
*  so long as you know we are like the the Jewish state, challenge that identity points and like [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1351.68s)]
*  really make the case for why it's better for Israel to be a democracy and a Jewish state. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1357.92s)]
*  I mean I know people would say they had you know, Buzi Herzog at times did and Zippy Lizzini at [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1362.24s)]
*  times did, but like nobody's really been in the way class of Bibi on that question. Yeah. And that [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1367.3600000000001s)]
*  may be the only thing that could reverse it. Right. Max, to your point though, I mean one challenge for [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1371.6000000000001s)]
*  the Israeli left is I imagine the people, the types of people who are moving to Israel, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1375.04s)]
*  right? I mean you're- And the demographics, he's being born in Israel. Right, it's not, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1380.8s)]
*  look I don't know this for sure, I'm not looking at data right now, but I hear less about these [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1385.68s)]
*  sort of socialist vision on the kibbutz than you hear about like hardline rabbis in Brooklyn moving [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1389.2s)]
*  to Israel to live on settlements. Right. Well let me read some stats because I think it's both like [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1395.44s)]
*  where's the pro-peace left? I think it's both a demand side and a supply side, the problem. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1400.72s)]
*  Yes, yeah. Well said. 62% of Israeli Jews identify as right-wing, but if you ask Israeli Jews who [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1405.44s)]
*  are between the ages of 18 and 24, it is 73%. Wow. So just like right-wing- It's getting more [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1415.5200000000002s)]
*  right-wing. It's getting much more right-wing. It's kind of counter to what that looks like. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1422.0800000000002s)]
*  Right. And even if you talk to, there's this really interesting poll that the Israeli Democracy [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1424.72s)]
*  Institute does where they kind of test like revealed preference around democracy versus [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1428.88s)]
*  Jewish identity where they say, do you think everyone who is an Israeli citizen or just [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1433.92s)]
*  Israeli Jews who are like three quarters of the population should be involved in big national [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1438.8000000000002s)]
*  decisions? And if you ask about security policy, 80% of Israeli Jews say that only Jews should be [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1443.8400000000001s)]
*  allowed to set those policies. But you know what's so ironic about this, Max, is like if there's this [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1450.3200000000002s)]
*  kind of trust in the kind of securitized part of the state, but the people who've raised their [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1456.32s)]
*  voices in the most alarmist tones for the last decade or more have been those guys, the security [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1461.76s)]
*  guys, the people in the military or in the Shin Bet warning about a two-state solution disappearing. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1470.56s)]
*  Right? I mean, it's kind of- Yeah, it's a good point. Yeah. And they were really trusted institution [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1479.04s)]
*  and like also has been really vocal on the Supreme Court and stuff, which is both heartening and is [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1483.28s)]
*  also like, it's a little worrying when the military is the one getting involved as the like vanguard [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1489.04s)]
*  or like safeguard of democracy. Absolutely. Absolutely. It's never great when you're like, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1494.24s)]
*  yay, army. Rarely ends well. Yeah. The question of what will reverse it is an interesting one [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1497.76s)]
*  because they've tried, if you think about what's been, they've tried a lot of different things, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1503.52s)]
*  right? So they did try a kind of military, Benny Gantz was the product of, right, a bunch of [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1507.44s)]
*  military guys essentially getting together and being like, the politicians are not working in [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1513.1999999999998s)]
*  standing up to Bibi. So who's the best guy to kind of be the front of a new movement? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1516.6399999999999s)]
*  That's Benny Gantz. That didn't work. Lapid was kind of this like the telegenic, you know, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1522.9599999999998s)]
*  new Israel, like entrepreneurial. And he's like the face of that, like the centrist personality, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1530.6399999999999s)]
*  who's going to stand up. That doesn't work. Then they tried like everything. They're like, okay, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1536.0s)]
*  we'll grab Bennett. We'll grab our own Jewish nationalists and we'll have Benny Gantz and [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1541.2s)]
*  level of peace. So we've got like the military and we've got like the kind of Tel Aviv, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1546.96s)]
*  broadcasting types and we've got young, more liberal entrepreneurs. And then we've got like [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1551.6000000000001s)]
*  Natalia Bennett, who just hates like, he's a never Bibi-er, you know, he just hates Bibi. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1557.68s)]
*  And that like didn't hold, you know. And to your point, how much of that is, because Bibi Netanyahu [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1564.24s)]
*  shaped Israeli politics for so long, how much of that is the demographics of Israel changing, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1572.8s)]
*  between not just people moving there, but the people who have more kids over the last 20 years [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1578.8s)]
*  tend to be, you know, obviously more conservative. How much of that is the U.S. enabling all this and [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1582.88s)]
*  not like doing anything to arrest it? That's the tough question, right? [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1589.12s)]
*  Yeah. Well, let's get into this U.S. piece. I want to talk about sort of the official Washington to [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1593.36s)]
*  Israel relationship. But first, I had a cultural question for you guys, because you may or may [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1599.6799999999998s)]
*  not have noticed, but I'm a bit of a wasp. These bounding identity of Israel questions weren't [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1603.76s)]
*  happening in my dinner table. Goldemeier wasn't like an extra presence at your dinner table. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1608.1599999999999s)]
*  I think if you could name seven Israeli political parties, you get some points. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1613.4399999999998s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. So I've been reading this great book. It's called Our American Israel by [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1617.52s)]
*  Amy Kaplan. She's a scholar. She does this deep dive into cultural ties between the U.S. and Israel [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1620.48s)]
*  and sort of the founding narratives of both countries. It's interesting because like the [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1625.28s)]
*  short version is that both countries want to tell a story about themselves as throwing off the yoke [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1628.56s)]
*  of their colonial rulers in both cases, the British and being these underdogs while ignoring [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1635.44s)]
*  conversations about indigenous communities that were displaced in that process, right? They want [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1640.8799999999999s)]
*  half of that story to be highlighted. If not, Kaplan also highlights the fact that the sort of [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1644.96s)]
*  collective American ego was so damaged in the 60s by the lack of clarity or moral victory in [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1650.5600000000002s)]
*  Vietnam or any victory in Vietnam that when Israel kept pulling off these incredible, daring military [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1659.1200000000001s)]
*  victories like the Six Day War, it was seen as like what we aspire to be. That's interesting. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1664.48s)]
*  Yeah. And she also highlights the influence of the book in film Exodus, which I think the film came [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1668.5600000000002s)]
*  out in 1960. It portrays Israel's founding as basically like a frontier western founded by [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1673.52s)]
*  like the most sort of handsome, telegenic people you could find, like Paul Newman, sort of the lead. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1679.8400000000001s)]
*  And I just wondered, did you watch Exodus? Did you read the book? Did you hear about these narratives [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1685.1200000000001s)]
*  at the dinner table? In my family, because we were not particularly religious and not just kind of [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1690.88s)]
*  by the time it got to me, even my full-on synagogue every Saturday, relatives were not [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1696.8s)]
*  that religious. You're like my mom's parents kind of thing. And there was this kind of weird guilt. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1705.2s)]
*  We came here to New York and we're living in Manhattan and they're out fighting against [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1712.72s)]
*  the Palestinians. They're out building this country. Facing down Arafat. I think deep in the heart of [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1720.24s)]
*  particularly American Jews who came of age in the early years of Israel when it wasn't like this, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1726.08s)]
*  it was like, well, they're over there fighting. We were just over here trying to make it in the US. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1730.8799999999999s)]
*  So that was part of the culture of it. Then there was definitely like a massive heroic narrative [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1737.28s)]
*  around both the military victories and these political leaders, just giants like Ben Gurion [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1741.68s)]
*  and Golda Meir and Rabin and all these people. They were like, you knew about them as much as [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1749.44s)]
*  you knew about American presidents in some ways. But then there was always also a discomfort [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1754.48s)]
*  about the Palestinian piece of it because I think people understood the unfairness. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1764.48s)]
*  But there was these other events that moved in the other direction like the Aggression 73, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1770.4s)]
*  the Munich Olympics. I remember being very aware of that in my house. So they discredited. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1775.8400000000001s)]
*  The view of Israel's military abd inflowed. I think during the 1982 evasion of Lebanon, [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1780.8799999999999s)]
*  there was a lot of condemnation of the Israeli military. Although when the Palestinian leadership [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1788.24s)]
*  was seen as embracing terrorism, I think that revolted most of it. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1793.04s)]
*  It started to turn. The other thing that happened over the course of my... We're all about the same [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1796.8s)]
*  age. So growing up in the 80s and 90s, the awareness and methodical and necessary, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1805.68s)]
*  entirely necessary commemoration of the Holocaust actually kind of grows in some ways. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1814.16s)]
*  I felt like my awareness of that event and its centrality to kind of view history actually grew. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1820.0s)]
*  It grew in the 80s. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1825.2s)]
*  Yeah. And then by the time you get to Schindler's List, that wasn't happening in the 60s. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1826.16s)]
*  Carter commissioned the Holocaust Museum. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1832.24s)]
*  The Holocaust Museum. They weren't making Schindler's List or opening Holocaust museums [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1833.92s)]
*  in the 60s. And that also associated Israel with that event in a way it always has been, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1837.44s)]
*  but it kind of refreshed that piece of Israeli legitimacy. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1845.2s)]
*  Which is... I'll talk about later why that's a complicated piece of business, but [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1848.96s)]
*  the way in which the Holocaust commemoration interacted with this issue is in American Jewish [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1856.24s)]
*  thought is interesting. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1862.0s)]
*  It's a story that I think about a lot from my family that I think represents for me the kind [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1862.8s)]
*  of shift that's been happening more recently in American Jews' attitudes towards Israel. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1868.32s)]
*  In 2014, my sister and I took our dad to Israel. My sister had worked a little bit in the West Bank [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1873.68s)]
*  on water issues, so we both felt very strongly about it. And my dad, most Jews of his generation [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1879.92s)]
*  were just like, these Israelis are the good guys. They're us, but stronger and better. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1885.04s)]
*  And the Palestinians are the bad guys. And he talked about growing up, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1889.76s)]
*  they were passing a cup around at synagogue to raise money for IDF uniforms in New Jersey. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1894.72s)]
*  And they used to send money to the kibbutz's and stuff like that. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1901.28s)]
*  Right, right, right. So this was his association and what he expected to see there was that, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1903.8400000000001s)]
*  okay, we're going to take you to Israel because he'd been asking to go for years, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1907.92s)]
*  but we're going to start by going to Bethlehem and we're going to go to Hebron. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1911.2s)]
*  And Hebron, for people who don't know, is just like, it's ground zero for the occupation. It's [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1916.72s)]
*  a divided city where half of it is controlled by a very small number of very extreme Israeli [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1922.72s)]
*  settlers and the other half is a large number of Palestinians who live under really horrible [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1928.48s)]
*  conditions. And our dad came away from it just completely reversing himself, just saying, this [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1932.88s)]
*  is unsustainable. This is crazy what's happening. I can't believe this. And even walking around [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1939.5200000000002s)]
*  the beautiful parts of Tel Aviv, he was seeing the kind of occupation projected onto it. And the [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1944.56s)]
*  Gaza war broke out two weeks later. So it ended up being a very fateful trip. And obviously, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1951.04s)]
*  most American Jews are not going to Hebron and seeing it firsthand. But I think that year in [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1956.6399999999999s)]
*  particular, and a lot of what has happened since in the occupation of the West Bank and especially [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1961.6s)]
*  conflicts in Gaza, I feel like a lot of Jews, and I think you see this in polls, are starting to [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1966.6399999999999s)]
*  really change how they see Israel and are not seeing it as an extension of themselves or their [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1970.96s)]
*  identity or their values anymore. So that's a fascinating sort of cultural window into the [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1975.28s)]
*  conversation. Let's talk about politics, official Washington to the Israeli government. So these [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1981.6000000000001s)]
*  days, I think most observers feel like there is very little debate or more recently, there's some [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1988.72s)]
*  debate. But for the last couple of decades, there has been little debate in Washington about the US [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1994.32s)]
*  Israel relationship to the extent there was debate. It was usually politicians are jockeying [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=1998.88s)]
*  to one up each other to declare their support for Israel to be more pro Israel. Here's a couple of [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2003.2800000000002s)]
*  rhetorical examples. The connection between the Israeli people and the American people is bone [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2008.16s)]
*  deep. Let me be know that we are with you. We are with Israel 100% Israel and America are connected [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2014.8000000000002s)]
*  now and forever is a true friend. It is our greatest ally in the region. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2024.24s)]
*  I stand with Israel because of our shared values, which are so fundamental to the founding of both [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2029.52s)]
*  our nations and our nation's friendship with Israel is not negotiable. So that was Biden, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2036.48s)]
*  Trump, Pelosi, Obama, Vice President Harris and Mitch McConnell. But that, you know, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2043.28s)]
*  the completely united opinion wasn't always the case. And the big picture question I want to ask [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2048.8s)]
*  you guys are in this section is to what extent is America's shift to total and complete unquestioned [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2054.8s)]
*  support for Israel and Israeli policies in a lot of cases contributed to the crisis we see today? [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2059.6s)]
*  So first, a quick bit of history. The US was the first country to recognize Israel as a state in [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2064.2400000000002s)]
*  1948, as you mentioned, Max. And for many years, many decades, really, the US Israeli relationship [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2069.36s)]
*  was normal with ups and downs based on events and interests. For example, in 1956 and 57, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2075.68s)]
*  President Eisenhower put enormous pressure on Israel to withdraw its troops from Egypt [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2081.6s)]
*  after Israeli troops occupied the Sinai Peninsula. The US even joined a UN resolution condemning the [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2086.24s)]
*  occupation in privately threatened sanctions and to cut off private assistance to Israel. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2092.08s)]
*  And it's just as someone who worked in government during the Obama administration, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2096.96s)]
*  it's unimaginable that any president would do that today. But again, in 1981, after Israel [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2100.72s)]
*  bombed an Iraqi nuclear reactor, President Reagan suspended delivery of fighter jets to Israel. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2106.56s)]
*  And the US again voted in support of the UN Security Council resolution condemning that strike. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2112.3199999999997s)]
*  President George H.W. Butch threatened to withhold loan guarantees from Israel until [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2118.16s)]
*  the Israeli government assured him that those funds wouldn't go towards building Israeli [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2122.64s)]
*  settlements in Palestinian territories. And listen to Bush's former Secretary of State Jim Baker [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2127.36s)]
*  venting his frustrations about the Israeli government's failure to constructively [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2133.6800000000003s)]
*  engage in peace talks. Here's a clip. It's going to take some really [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2138.88s)]
*  good faith, affirmative effort on the part of our good friends in Israel. And if we don't get it, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2143.92s)]
*  and if we can't get it quickly, I have to tell you, Mr. Levine, that everybody over there [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2151.04s)]
*  should know that the telephone number is 1-202-456-1414. When you're serious about [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2159.44s)]
*  peace, call us. So that sounds a little less bone deep than Biden's take. So the question is, [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2168.56s)]
*  what changed and when? Max, do you have a theory? [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2174.32s)]
*  I actually do. I think that this history, the bone deep history is way shallower than people [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2178.0s)]
*  think or that we recite to each other. I think it really, it starts, I think, very superficially [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2186.0s)]
*  with Bill Clinton, who has this idea that turned out to be, I think, really wrong, that in order to [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2191.92s)]
*  get the Israelis to go along with the two-state solution and to go along with Oslo, you have to [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2198.24s)]
*  just hug them really closely and just give them whatever they want and make them feel really [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2202.88s)]
*  secure and really confident. Dennis Ross there. Right. Yeah. Quite literally. Right. Right. Yeah. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2206.64s)]
*  And Martin Indick had this line about hug BB close, BB Netanyahu. And then, of course, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2210.56s)]
*  he just pocketed all that. And I think it becomes cultural and does become a little bit deeper with [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2216.0s)]
*  George W. Bush and September 11 and the second Intifada, which is the uprising and very violent [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2223.52s)]
*  conflict between Israelis and Palestinians in the early 2000s, that I think leads to this view [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2229.92s)]
*  among a lot of Americans that we're fighting the same fight and we're like two countries that are [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2235.04s)]
*  like-minded. And when you talk to like Israeli political scientists, they will say like that is [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2240.16s)]
*  actually really when it starts. So it's, I think it's so much more recent. I do too. I mean, just [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2244.56s)]
*  to add to what you said, George H.W. Bush was obviously famously hard on the Israeli government. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2248.96s)]
*  You heard those clips. Bill Clinton then got 80% of the Jewish vote in the next election and 78% [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2253.2799999999997s)]
*  in his re-elect. So I imagine that sends some warning flags up in Republican political headquarters [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2259.12s)]
*  to be like, oh, shit, we got to get some of these votes back or else we're going to keep losing. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2263.84s)]
*  I also think, to your point, after 9-11, the Israelis understood terrorism in our minds as [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2267.76s)]
*  well as we did. So it securitized that relationship. But there was also the rise of the evangelical. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2272.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, this is where I was going to go. Yeah, go ahead. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2277.44s)]
*  Yeah, because Baker's a fascinating example of this. So Baker also famously literally, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2279.1200000000003s)]
*  to connect to Beck Netanyahu, he barred Netanyahu from the State Department. He was so like- [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2284.7200000000003s)]
*  That's so incredible. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2290.08s)]
*  He was so sick of this kind of like mid-level or upper diplomat, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2290.8s)]
*  kind of messing around our policies, like he barred from the State Department. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2295.52s)]
*  If you fast forwarded 20 years, Jim Baker is controversial in the Republican Party in part [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2299.28s)]
*  because he's seen as having this legacy in Israel. Jim Baker, who literally delivered multiple [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2304.0800000000004s)]
*  White Houses to the Republican Party, is far less popular in the Republican Party today than [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2309.28s)]
*  the man that he once barred from the State Department. And I think part of that is that [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2317.04s)]
*  the evangelical movement at some point, and 9-11 may have had something to do with this, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2320.08s)]
*  but somehow Israel just became more important. And I'm not, this is a culture I don't know much [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2326.56s)]
*  about, but it's undeniable that Republicans used to be the party where there was a little bit more [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2331.04s)]
*  internal debate about Israel. Now with the evangelical movement and the securitization [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2335.44s)]
*  of the Republican Party of 9-11, what you were saying, Max, that's like a perfect storm of just [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2340.16s)]
*  uniformity of support for Republicans, for Israel. And then Republicans figure something out, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2345.7599999999998s)]
*  they particularly figure out in the Obama years, which is that this is a good issue to divide [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2352.48s)]
*  Democrats on, because they understand that in the Democratic psyche, we share a lot of identity with [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2355.9199999999996s)]
*  Israel, like most, almost all members of Congress are Jewish or Democrats and they're liberals. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2362.64s)]
*  But we also, our values tend to make us sympathize with Palestinians. And so that dynamic kind of [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2368.72s)]
*  pulls support for Israel to the right. And it also makes it harder for anybody to step out of line. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2375.6s)]
*  And as someone who had to write those speeches you're playing, like I'm deeply familiar with [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2384.4s)]
*  how the language. Well, I want to ask you about that, because I was talking with Jeremy Ben-Ami, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2388.24s)]
*  who was head of JSTRI, and we talked about Obama's Cairo speech, which for those who don't know, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2392.56s)]
*  it was this famous speech Obama delivered in June of 2009. It was an attempt to reset relations [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2397.6s)]
*  with the Muslim world after the Iraq war and post 9-11 war on terror hysteria. And in that speech, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2402.7999999999997s)]
*  Obama said, quote, America's strong bonds with Israel are well known. This bond is unbreakable. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2408.96s)]
*  It is based on cultural and historical ties and the recognition that the aspiration for a Jewish [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2413.8399999999997s)]
*  homeland is rooted in a tragic history that cannot be denied, meaning the Holocaust, obviously. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2418.08s)]
*  And I was wondering if you remembered where that unbreakable formulation came from, [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2422.88s)]
*  because maybe it had become sort of pat at that point. But I guess saying that to that room or [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2427.92s)]
*  to that audience does sort of say to them, like, hey, I'm reaching out to all of you, but this [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2433.6800000000003s)]
*  relationship is still a special tier. And you're never going to hit that level. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2438.96s)]
*  Oh, man. It's a fascinating story. So I mean, first of all, there were [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2444.4s)]
*  always suspicions of Obama that he wasn't sufficiently pro-Israel despite having a [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2449.68s)]
*  relatively conventional record on Israel, you know, like came out of the Jewish community in [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2454.16s)]
*  Chicago in a lot of ways, voted pretty mainstream on things in Congress. And I always thought, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2458.64s)]
*  I'm just going to name this, like there was something kind of racialized about it, you know, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2465.68s)]
*  like, oh, yeah, well, the black guy is going to sympathize more with the Palestinians, you know, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2468.88s)]
*  which is kind of a tell, right, that you're not treating the Palestinians. The Palestinians are [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2472.8s)]
*  treated in the same way that the blacks have been treated in this country. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2477.76s)]
*  Interesting. There was sort of like Black Panther solidarity with the Palestinian cause [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2480.64s)]
*  very early on. And it was sort of seen as part of this like Che Guevara Cuba, like sort of [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2484.7200000000003s)]
*  anti-colonial zeitgeist, which I don't know, culturally cool. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2489.84s)]
*  And you remember from 2008, right? They would go out to like Rashid Khalidi because he was kind [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2496.32s)]
*  of like a scholar that came out of that movement or Edward Said, you know, people that Obama [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2500.56s)]
*  expressed admiration for. But anyway, to get to Cairo, I think everybody knew going into that [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2504.64s)]
*  speech that he was going to be, you know, trying to reset a conversation with Muslim audiences. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2509.2s)]
*  And so there was great concern that would he like throw Israel under the bus and [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2516.56s)]
*  and played into these fears that Obama was this kind of quiet radical. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2520.7999999999997s)]
*  Actually, we started to ask one of the main asks a member from APAC before that speech, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2526.16s)]
*  because they came in and said what they wanted to hear in the speech like that actually happens, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2530.88s)]
*  was that Obama demand that the that the Muslim world recognize Israel and recognize it as a Jewish [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2536.32s)]
*  state, which was a super interesting ask because, you know, to get into the weeds, that's basically [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2543.52s)]
*  asking the Muslim world to renounce the right of return for Palestinians. Like it's an interest. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2551.92s)]
*  That's not how they framed it. And the rights of Palestinians in Israel. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2556.1600000000003s)]
*  Israel. Yeah. So we didn't go there. So then it's like, I remember being like, you know, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2559.6s)]
*  we're going to we're going to just we're going to hug. But what we can do is state what Obama [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2564.4s)]
*  thought was the truth, which culturally, like for a lot of reasons, we had this bond that's bigger [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2570.56s)]
*  than me, essentially. It's it's it's a bond between our countries. And that's going to be a tough [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2575.52s)]
*  message to that audience. By the way, to fast forward, he then talked very specifically about [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2580.64s)]
*  the occupation in ways that American president never had. And so there was plenty in it, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2586.48s)]
*  you know, for that audience. But the interesting one was the Holocaust because [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2590.16s)]
*  Obama, I remember part of that speech was supposed to be like hard truths, telling hard truths. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2595.2s)]
*  So we were trying to call out Holocaust denial. And after the tragic history, he then has some [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2599.92s)]
*  language condemning Holocaust denial, got a tremendously negative reaction from Israel. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2606.48s)]
*  Why? Because rooting Israel in the Holocaust undermines the idea that this is the historical [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2611.6800000000003s)]
*  moment of the Jewish people is fascinating. Max, right. Like I got a lot of angry phone calls. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2618.96s)]
*  What is this Holocaust stuff? I'm like, wait, I thought you'd like that. You know, like it actually [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2623.6800000000003s)]
*  know. But this is it was such an interesting moment because it lifted the hood on the difference [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2629.28s)]
*  between like a secular American Jewish mindset. It is like, well, of course, Israel's history is [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2632.7200000000003s)]
*  in part rooted in the Holocaust. Obviously, it dates back to ancient times. But like, you know, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2637.6s)]
*  it was founded right after the Holocaust and the mass migrations and the world feeling like, you [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2642.72s)]
*  know, we have to get behind this. Well, it's a break from Israel's own secular Zionist founders, [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2648.24s)]
*  I mean, even the ones before the Holocaust, who saw it as a creation of this like 19th century [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2654.56s)]
*  world. You have to have like a homeland for Jews that is rooted in modernity and that like [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2658.64s)]
*  picked this place where Jews had been before. But the I mean, to your point, the idea that it is a [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2662.72s)]
*  like continuous 3000 year homeland, which is often furthered to mean that like, therefore, [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2667.6s)]
*  the West Bank should be all right. Exactly. Right. Yeah. Is something that is like kind of out of [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2672.3199999999997s)]
*  step with a lot of their own national founders. It is that represents a movement to the right of [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2677.44s)]
*  the rhetoric. And there really was a couple people will take everything I see out of context, but [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2681.68s)]
*  I was not playing this sensitive issue. But the point is that like people watch your language on [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2688.32s)]
*  this stuff very carefully and they will let you know if they don't hear unbreakable bond or bone [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2693.36s)]
*  deep, they will complain to you that they didn't hear it. But at the same time that that's happening, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2697.76s)]
*  right, you have a situation where like Israeli politics is moving to the right. So what is [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2702.96s)]
*  expected of American politicians in terms of the rhetoric is also moving to the right. And there [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2709.84s)]
*  was another thing that happened in the violence first year, Tommy, you remember Obama met with a [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2714.56s)]
*  bunch of Jewish leaders and they got into a very brief dispute that ended up being this thing that [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2718.7999999999997s)]
*  dogged us for eight years about whether the U.S. could ever show any daylight from Israel. And Obama [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2725.12s)]
*  said, sometimes it's actually useful to Israel if the U.S. has a little daylight, because we have [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2731.7599999999998s)]
*  some credibility as an independent voice. And actually the position in that room and then [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2736.72s)]
*  became something was hung around Obama. And if you remember these debates, Tommy, like, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2741.84s)]
*  I can't believe Obama ever said there should be daylight. The idea that we would never have [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2745.36s)]
*  daylight with another country on anything. You don't outsource your decision making to another [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2749.44s)]
*  country. Is it sure. But you lived through it on the I mean, we have to unpack each of these, [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2752.8s)]
*  but the flotilla, the Goldstone report, there's always something where it's a don't show daylight. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2757.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And look, this sort of this unbreakable formulation ultimately is backed [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2762.4s)]
*  by Obama, at least with a 10 year, 38 billion dollars security assistance guarantee [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2766.48s)]
*  that I think speaks to the Holocaust narrative of never again and making sure that Israel has [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2771.28s)]
*  got this qualitative military edge. And over there was a CRS report, Congressional Research [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2776.8s)]
*  Service report from February 2020 that totaled up the assistance in the U.S. has provided Israel [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2782.5600000000004s)]
*  with 150 billion in bilateral assistance and missile defense funding since its founding. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2788.48s)]
*  So it's a ton of cash. So here's the big question, Max. To what extent do you think [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2793.1200000000003s)]
*  the U.S. owns some of the kind of political twists and turns in Israel [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2798.48s)]
*  that led them to the brink of this judicial coup? I think it's a I think that's a really [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2803.0400000000004s)]
*  important question for figuring out what should America do towards Israel right now. And also, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2808.5600000000004s)]
*  what should America do towards countries that are maybe going down a similar path? Like there are [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2814.4s)]
*  real lessons here for how do we think about America's relationship to India, for example, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2818.2400000000002s)]
*  which is like really, you know, different context, but like following a similar path. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2823.52s)]
*  I think that if you look, if you go a little further back in the 90s, I think there's a lot [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2827.92s)]
*  of ownership in the 2000s. I think there's a ton of ownership, especially as Israel is pushing [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2833.2000000000003s)]
*  so far to the right during the second Intifada. My kind of contrarian take on this, but which I do [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2837.84s)]
*  come to through reporting and talking to a lot of security analysts and political analysts is that [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2845.84s)]
*  while it would be the right thing to do for the United States to say this is no longer going to [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2851.6s)]
*  be unconditional, we are now going to condition this on democracy and on rights for Palestinians [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2856.8s)]
*  in the West Bank and Gaza, whether that means a two state solution or a one state solution. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2862.72s)]
*  I don't think that America has that much leverage anymore. If you talk to military analysts, they [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2866.96s)]
*  will say, you know, for a long time, Israel depended on American weapons, but all those [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2873.36s)]
*  capabilities are indigenous now, which they did very deliberately so that they would not suffer [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2877.6s)]
*  militarily if the U.S. one day cut off aid. Economically, the military aid used to be [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2882.0s)]
*  equivalent to 10% of their GDP. Now it's equivalent to about 1% of their GDP, so it's just not as much [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2887.44s)]
*  of a hit. And political analysts will tell you that Israeli politicians used to pay a big price [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2891.92s)]
*  domestically for being seen as not having the Americans on board. And that was Netanyahu's big [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2897.04s)]
*  asset. He was like, he gets the Americans, he can talk to them. And now they, Israeli voters don't [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2902.16s)]
*  really care as much about that because they kind of think like America just doesn't matter for us [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2906.88s)]
*  as much anymore. And they very carefully cultivated a lot of other allies, which has been this very [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2912.1600000000003s)]
*  deliberate diplomatic campaign they have called the Other Friends to like bring in other countries [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2917.6s)]
*  that can be allies for them to offset their reliance on the U.S. So I think that there [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2923.04s)]
*  was a window when we had a lot of leverage that could have forced things in a better direction, [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2927.92s)]
*  but I think that window might have closed. What about the diplomatic shield, Max? [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2933.04s)]
*  That's probably the biggest one. The Security Council veto. The UN Security Council will [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2939.6s)]
*  occasionally have resolutions condemning Israel for bombing Gaza, for the occupation of Palestinians, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2945.12s)]
*  things like that. And the United States has basically a policy of down the line vetoing [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2952.56s)]
*  anything, which does an enormous amount to shield Israel from international consequences. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2957.04s)]
*  And the UK and France, which formerly participated in that veto, have basically backed away from it [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2964.24s)]
*  in the last 10 years or so. And it's now just the U.S. that is the one saying, [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2968.48s)]
*  the UN, we're not going to protect Israel at the UN. And it extends to the ICC, [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2972.16s)]
*  the International Criminal Court, and all these other pieces of the international system too. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2976.0s)]
*  Right. Then Max, I think, raises a really interesting question, which is, [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2979.04s)]
*  why is it that the United States will move heaven and earth and send hundreds of billions of dollars [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2983.92s)]
*  to countries like Ukraine or Taiwan that are being invaded to protect those democracies, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2988.96s)]
*  but seemingly doesn't have a lot to say when the world's biggest democracy, India, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2993.76s)]
*  or the democracy in Israel, are doing things to harm themselves? [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=2998.5600000000004s)]
*  This is such a big question. We may have to do another bonus episode on this. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3002.6400000000003s)]
*  This has been really interesting. The obvious starting point is we care about democracy when [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3006.0800000000004s)]
*  our geopolitical interests suit it and not when they don't. Right. And that's the hard, [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3011.6s)]
*  these are the politicians, the only time they talk about democracy. And this is part of my [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3016.0s)]
*  challenge, frankly, to even the Ann Applebaum kind of view of it's Venezuela, Iran, Russia. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3019.92s)]
*  It's easy to oppose autocracy in these countries. India, Israel are harder. And Turkey even has [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3026.64s)]
*  been hard for us because they're in NATO. That's the problem. I think the corollary to that problem [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3033.7599999999998s)]
*  is in the Cold War, we supported all kinds of right wing dictators. But the end goal was [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3039.84s)]
*  democracy. Right? The end goal was open society, capitalism, and democracy so that when we were [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3049.44s)]
*  achieving our objectives in the 80s, we started abandoning support for all those right wing [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3056.32s)]
*  dictators and they all collapsed basically almost every one of them. And then you have this democratic [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3060.88s)]
*  tide in the 90s. We've never lived through a period of where there's a democratic recession, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3064.96s)]
*  among our allies like this before. It's a new thing for Americans to deal with. And we haven't [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3069.68s)]
*  found the tools. I focus on the diplomatic shield because I think in some ways you can suggest that [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3076.0s)]
*  there are certain security interests that when states get involved, it's more complicated for [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3081.7599999999998s)]
*  them to be completely values based. But what you say and how you vote and what you emphasize in [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3090.08s)]
*  the national community, that is in your control. And that's what like a Modi, bringing Modi into [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3097.76s)]
*  this is useful. It's very different in some ways because Modi's obviously not dependent on us for [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3104.88s)]
*  billions of dollars in security assistance in the way Israel is. But he thinks that at the end of [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3110.0800000000004s)]
*  the day we need him somehow more than he needs us or something and so therefore we'll never [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3114.7200000000003s)]
*  criticize him and we'll do nothing. I think we have to kind of, the first step is to not self-censor. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3119.2000000000003s)]
*  I'd just like to see us try that on these issues with Israel a little bit more. And this is where [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3125.44s)]
*  we got in a bit of a different place in the administration on the quiet intense diplomacy [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3129.44s)]
*  around Gaza. But like so part of it is just like I'd like it to us to find a legitimate voice and [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3134.08s)]
*  to at least name this discomfort instead of standing up and saying the platitudes about Israel being [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3139.84s)]
*  the only democracy in the Middle East and we share all these values without like saying and we're both [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3144.7999999999997s)]
*  struggling with them. It's not just Israel. So that to me that's the biggest thing. And as someone [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3149.52s)]
*  who does care about Israel, I think they're wrong. If I'm going to bet that I can like ultimately [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3155.2s)]
*  somehow risk the US relationship because I'm making agreements with like the Gulf Arabs and [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3163.7599999999998s)]
*  we were getting along pretty well with Putin there for a while and maybe we, the Indians like buy our [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3171.68s)]
*  defense equipment. Like given the history of the Jewish people, that's I'd much rather bet on America [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3177.12s)]
*  and so I actually worry that they're making a miscalculation because I think you're right Max [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3183.6s)]
*  that their judgment is oh we actually don't need this as much. But I don't know man it's like it's [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3187.8399999999997s)]
*  a better insurance policy to me than thinking you can cobble together some other semi-autocratic [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3194.0s)]
*  friends. Well I feel like this gets back to this like core question because the countries they're [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3198.88s)]
*  choosing to partner with are not Europe. Right, right. It tends to be the like right-wing populist [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3203.04s)]
*  ethno-nationalists and it's like a microcosm of the same choice. Do you partner with the [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3210.4s)]
*  ethno-nationalists who love you because you're being really horrible to minorities in your country [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3215.04s)]
*  or do you partner with the big liberal democracy that expects you to have a liberal secular state [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3219.44s)]
*  but also has a vision of that that at least in the US works pretty well for Jews? Yeah, the self-centering [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3223.68s)]
*  frustrates me to no end. I mean I re-watched in preparation for recording this episode and just to [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3230.0s)]
*  drive up my blood pressure Bibi Netanyahu's speech I think 2015 to the US Congress announcing his [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3236.0s)]
*  opposition to the Iran nuclear agreement and when you juxtapose that with calls to or scolding of [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3242.56s)]
*  Obama for suggesting there might in fact be times when there's daylight between the United States [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3250.32s)]
*  and Israel policies and saying I mean imagine if imagine if Joe Biden went to the Knesset and [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3254.56s)]
*  delivered a speech about the Israeli judicial system and then maybe you should yeah yeah yeah [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3259.36s)]
*  I would love it. Now their response would be like those are internal affairs. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3265.12s)]
*  How dare you. Yeah yeah yeah. But like you know what the Iran nuclear agreement and you know [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3269.2s)]
*  preventing the Iranians from getting a nuke matters to all of us equally I would argue. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3273.84s)]
*  And where that issue was in American politics at the time was it was like an identity politics [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3277.6s)]
*  right right right. So just to close us out here Max you got an idea for us on how to secure the [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3281.3599999999997s)]
*  future of Israel's democracy? I honestly I know that's a like let me give you my like 3,000 word [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3288.56s)]
*  answer. I actually think that in some ways it is deceptively simple which I think they have to [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3294.8799999999997s)]
*  solve the occupation. I think that the occupation puts so much pressure on all of these questions [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3301.3599999999997s)]
*  at the securitization of the state the pressure that it puts on identity versus democracy. I think [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3306.64s)]
*  that it is the thing that makes this so unsustainable and that's not an easy thing to just snap your [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3312.48s)]
*  fingers and solve. They did withdraw from Gaza not so long ago so it's at least theoretically [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3318.16s)]
*  possible but I think until that is solved this is going to keep coming back. But I think if they can [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3322.48s)]
*  figure that out which countries have figured out harder problems than this then I think you could [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3328.16s)]
*  have Israeli democracy prosper for a long time. I'm glad you said that Max because like and to [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3332.72s)]
*  tie back to like what you said at the beginning about your dad I had a much like less vivid [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3338.8799999999997s)]
*  experience but I remember when we went to Israel in 2013 I was in a motorcade that's what so this [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3346.0s)]
*  is not like out walking around but we drove through the security barrier right and so for people [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3353.3599999999997s)]
*  to know there's what's been described as a security barrier that's been built in basically the 21st [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3358.72s)]
*  century and it's been you know it's described as security barrier or a fence you know it's a big [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3362.8799999999997s)]
*  debate over what the color of the shed. When you actually drive through it it's a prison wall it's what it looks like it is a giant giant very very thick wall [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3367.3599999999997s)]
*  with like 50 feet yeah yeah it is enormous in some places and I remember even in a presence of motor [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3375.68s)]
*  gate we had to drive through it and I remember just being incredibly uncomfortable driving through that [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3380.9599999999996s)]
*  wall and then getting on the other side and the standard of living dropped hundreds of percent you [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3386.08s)]
*  know when you're in Palestinian Bethlehem and this is like the richest this is where there's tourism and [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3390.72s)]
*  you can't live on the other side of that wall and not be impacted by that you know and the [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3397.36s)]
*  securitization and the rationalization around the occupation I think is a cousin of everything we've [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3404.32s)]
*  been talking about or sibling I guess I'd end as my speechwriter which I don't normally but like the [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3411.12s)]
*  reality is like the reality is that this can change if Israelis enough Israelis want to change you know [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3417.2799999999997s)]
*  and keep marching they really can change things like they have tremendous agency it's it is still [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3424.08s)]
*  a democracy where they elect their leaders and and Max your point part of what's so troubling is we [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3429.3599999999997s)]
*  all see the writing on the wall in the polls that it looks like actually it's kind of 60 40 for this [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3434.0s)]
*  direction but we've seen that kind of politics change and pendulums change swing back and [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3437.92s)]
*  frankly we've seen Jewish people do far more extraordinary things and you know in just Israel's [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3444.48s)]
*  history so you know to me that it's as simple as that in so far as the U.S. can play any kind of [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3450.96s)]
*  constructive role in that that's important I think enabling Israel's all the things is [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3456.0s)]
*  is not been helpful so yeah it's just a question people have to think that they have agency on this [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3464.0s)]
*  and that includes in this country there's a there's a pretty focused effort to make people think that [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3470.1600000000003s)]
*  that all these questions are just settled or it's not worth engaging in any conversation about it [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3474.6400000000003s)]
*  and or it's too complicated or it's too complicated understand right and or like you'll get the shit [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3479.28s)]
*  kicked out of you online yeah like like we will yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no but I think [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3483.28s)]
*  that's exactly right I mean well said both of you and and you know just to close this out I mean do [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3489.52s)]
*  you think from a from a U.S. perspective I think it's fair to say that going from Obama to President [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3492.64s)]
*  Biden is a bit of a step back in terms of more of a traditional no daylight yeah U.S. Israel policy [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3500.16s)]
*  and I'm sure that probably frustrates some people out there but there is also I think a growing [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3506.4s)]
*  coalition of progressives on the left who are left who are willing to say who are willing to like [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3512.56s)]
*  have rational debates about the U.S. Israeli relationship and to say no absolutely not the [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3518.2400000000002s)]
*  U.S. should not you know allow U.S. aid to Israel to be used to annex the West Bank that is obviously [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3523.6800000000003s)]
*  not what is intended to do and so you know I think listening to those voices propping up organizations [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3531.5200000000004s)]
*  like J Street that are taking a more thoughtful approach to the relationship than say APAC has [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3536.88s)]
*  is important and I think will benefit everybody totally all right well we solved it we solved it [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3543.28s)]
*  good for us 1948 to April 26 is when we recorded this check all right well thanks everyone for [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3548.5600000000004s)]
*  listening if you like these deeper dive issues tell us some more topics you want to hear about [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3554.4s)]
*  because we like doing them yeah we've gotten some good ones all right that's all we got [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3559.6800000000003s)]
*  you [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4itpCf3t3Tk&t=3577.76s)]
