*  I remember I went out to brunch that day and then I came home to my house and Michael O'Neill friend of the pod [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=63.0s)]
*  one of the greatest people we've ever known was my roommate at the time had multiple roommates and Michael O'Neill had [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=68.5s)]

*  Yeah, and I remember turning to people who are there [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=87.58s)]
*  I was like do you guys think I can wear this in or is that just too douchey? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=89.46000000000001s)]
*  No, you should have worn the Jersey. That's too douchey [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=91.74000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I changed yeah, and then I walked into the situation room and there was a photo of bin Laden's face with the bullet in it [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=93.74000000000001s)]

*  Yeah, you know, I remember that week before that was I remember [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=111.66000000000001s)]
*  You had been working on some speech and Dennis kept like that's right desperately trying to find you [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=114.86s)]
*  Yeah to tell you something but you were a hold up writing the speech [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=119.42s)]
*  You were stressed about the speech and then all of a sudden you weren't stressed about the speech [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=122.34s)]
*  I knew it wasn't done. It was like postponed [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=125.54s)]
*  Yeah, that was actually interesting because I I had been trying to work on this speech for days and I couldn't find time then finally [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=127.30000000000001s)]
*  One day I'm like I'm just not gonna come into work at all [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=133.58s)]
*  And it disappeared in a coffee shop and like somehow Dennis found me [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=135.58s)]
*  He's got way I guess if you're in the White House [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=139.9s)]
*  Yeah, you know and he called me in for like some meeting with him and Brennan and [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=141.7s)]
*  It was the most stern they could close the door behind me. I thought I was gonna get like killed [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=146.18s)]
*  I thought I might get rendered somewhere. I mean it was really scary. It was like in that basement office [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=150.34s)]
*  John Brennan like, you know stone face that closed the door behind you and instead they were like we have a lead on bin Laden's compound [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=155.14s)]
*  You know like very dramatic. That's cool. Well, this is better than the speeches. That's way better than writing speech [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=161.94s)]
*  I remember going to Brennan's office in hindsight and seeing a [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=167.1s)]
*  binder this thick on his desk that said something on the cover like a bad about compound rate [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=170.94s)]
*  In hindsight, I knew what that meant. But at the moment, yeah, I didn't know what about about was creative labeling anyway [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=176.85999999999999s)]
*  Probably Nick Shapiro labeled that puppy. Just kidding. We know you didn't do that [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=183.42s)]
*  Anyway, we got a great show for you guys today. No bin Laden operations [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=187.33999999999997s)]
*  No, but we're gonna talk about some hopeful news for once been about a possible ceasefire in Gaza [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=190.66s)]
*  We got some sound from protesters at some of these campuses in New York that we will bring to you [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=195.62s)]
*  There's interesting reports of intelligence on whether Vladimir Putin ordered the killing of opposition leader Alexei Navalny [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=201.64000000000001s)]
*  The major news will talk through the major news out of Tony Blinken's visit to China [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=208.18s)]
*  There has been more reporting on assassinations abroad or attempted assassinations abroad by India's intelligence services [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=213.18s)]
*  Why our Iranian rapper was sentenced to death a major leadership change in Scotland? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=219.58s)]
*  And then you're gonna hear my interview with John McDermott from The Economist [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=224.54s)]
*  We both have known for years that my other roommate during the moment of the bin Laden operation Cody Keenan. Yes. Yes [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=228.26s)]
*  Yes, they met at Harvard. I think Kennedy School smart kids. Yeah. Yes, my guys smacking smack kids. Anyway, I've had economists [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=234.62s)]
*  John's the chief Africa correspondent for The Economist and we talked about South Africa's upcoming election [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=243.06s)]
*  The 30th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide and the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda and how that might work out [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=249.29999999999998s)]
*  So super interesting interview from a very very smart and thoughtful journalist. I I still have good bow hunting [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=256.88s)]
*  My head now, how about that apples? Do you like apples? I? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=262.86s)]
*  Have like one friend who went to Harvard and me and my other buddies would go into the Harvard bars underage and act like we [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=267.38s)]
*  Were like local town toughs, but you know kids went to like Cornell or something. It's all relative, you know nerds [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=273.52s)]
*  Nerds is what we were and they were too. All right, Ben [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=279.42s)]
*  But it was very easy to drink underage in Cambridge for some reason [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=282.5s)]
*  It was very easy to drink underage growing up in New York City [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=285.90000000000003s)]
*  Well, yeah [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=288.46000000000004s)]
*  so his Irish bars actually you could be like 16 years old and sitting at the bar and [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=289.5s)]
*  Then some off-duty cop would come like alright all the kids go out the back door [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=292.98s)]
*  Because the cops would call off and tip off before they'd raid these bars [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=296.62s)]
*  Oh really and so you're just gonna go hang out outside for like 15 minutes and then they're like quote unquote raid the bar [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=299.62s)]
*  And then you just come back in corruption for question was good [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=304.42s)]
*  In like the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=307.62s)]
*  Underage drinking scene where was the upper East Side? I guess I get canceled for this but yeah, I pretty side up or side [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=310.9s)]
*  I was gonna cancel you for a drink in when you're 19. I'm not gonna break. Yeah, come on. He's a New Yorker. Yeah [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=315.53999999999996s)]
*  Who's on first that was a great bar [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=322.62s)]
*  That's it. Where was that that was on like First Avenue and like 89th Street or something. Okay, that was okay. Yeah [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=324.86s)]
*  Pat O'Brien's sure there's some good ones a trillion of those. Yeah [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=330.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=334.70000000000005s)]
*  Okay, let's get to the show so Ben like we tease at the top so some good news out of Gaza for once [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=335.90000000000003s)]
*  Hopefully there's all these reports that Israel and Hamas are close to agreeing on a temporary ceasefire and hostage release deal [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=341.34000000000003s)]
*  It would involve Hamas releasing 33 civilian hostages in exchange for a 40-day ceasefire in [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=347.46000000000004s)]
*  Israel releasing some number maybe thousands of Palestinian prisoners being held in Israel [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=353.82000000000005s)]
*  there also seems to be some sort of agreement about [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=358.86s)]
*  Allowing Gazans to return to northern Gaza [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=362.09999999999997s)]
*  Which is a change and hopefully a breakthrough so, you know for months there's part of this is pretty grim for months [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=365.3s)]
*  Israel had demanded the release of 40 hostages as part of this deal [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=371.41999999999996s)]
*  But they have since I think come to the very sad conclusion that some of those hostages died in captivity and they lowered the demand [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=374.58s)]
*  To 33 but Biden's been pushing very hard to get this done on Sunday and Monday [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=380.47999999999996s)]
*  He talked with the leaders of Israel Qatar and Egypt [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=385.02s)]
*  Tony Blinken is in Secretary of State Tony Blinken is in Saudi Arabia or was on Monday [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=388.26s)]
*  For meetings and had this to say about the negotiations a major effort that's been made [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=393.53999999999996s)]
*  Over the last couple of months to get to that ceasefire to get the hostages out and right now as you said [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=398.34s)]
*  Hamas has before it a proposal that is [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=404.82s)]
*  Extraordinarily extraordinarily generous [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=409.21999999999997s)]
*  On the part of Israel and in this moment the only thing [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=412.58s)]
*  Standing between the people of Gaza and a ceasefire is a mosque [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=416.86s)]
*  So Ben obviously, you know the US wants the hostages to come home because we want them to be home. We want to also [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=419.7s)]
*  Flood Gaza with aid during any ceasefire [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=425.34s)]
*  But there's also reports that the Biden team hopes that a ceasefire [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=428.58s)]
*  Could lead to kind of a de facto end of the war or at least make it so so politically difficult for Netanyahu to start [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=432.14s)]
*  Things back up or do a pursue this Rafa invasion [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=437.9s)]
*  Of course right on cue Netanyahu said today that he will invade Rafa with or without a hostage deal again for those who don't know [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=441.38s)]
*  Rafa is a city in southern Gaza where about a million people are sheltering some estimates say up to 1.4 million [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=448.53999999999996s)]
*  so Ben I hope this is just posturing from Netanyahu to appease kind of the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=454.41999999999996s)]
*  right-wing crazies in his coalition who want a Rafa invasion no matter what I was wondering what you made of that comment from [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=459.41999999999996s)]
*  Netanyahu and I don't know where it's like the hope meter on [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=465.86s)]
*  This ceasefire leading to a permanent end in the conflict [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=469.21999999999997s)]
*  Well, it's the first time in many weeks that there's been any positive messaging coming out [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=473.14s)]
*  It seems to me in this makes sense for them to be doing it that part of what's happening is all the other parties [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=480.21999999999997s)]
*  You know because you saw a bunch of Arab states in these talks [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=487.46s)]
*  you saw a bunch of Europeans in these talks that everybody is trying to take this window and [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=491.26s)]
*  Really press Hamas to [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=497.62s)]
*  Accept the terms that Israel's offering [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=500.82000000000005s)]
*  And so there's you know pretty coordinated effort to kind of say [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=503.3s)]
*  This is now a reasonable offer you should take it and sometimes the optimism is a part of that [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=506.38s)]
*  It's like we're putting out there that there's a deal [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=511.1s)]
*  It's you know, just and I think good vibes only that the good vibes only [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=513.4200000000001s)]
*  you know, cuz they've tried bad vibes and [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=518.46s)]
*  and the you know the question on the Hamas side is [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=520.78s)]
*  You know who is making this deal, you know [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=524.86s)]
*  Because it could even be that they've really squeezed the kind of quote-unquote political leadership in Qatar who are [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=527.78s)]
*  people with their own vulnerabilities, you know, there's [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=534.9s)]
*  Money that can be you know gotten it. I should be anyway, obviously [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=537.98s)]
*  We should be cutting off that financing but it's not entirely clear whether those guys [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=542.1800000000001s)]
*  Can reach down into some tunnel and and Rafa and deliver something? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=546.94s)]
*  And so part of what's being tested is both Hamas's [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=551.6600000000001s)]
*  Willingness to make a deal at that political level and then their capacity to at this point in the war, you know [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=555.7s)]
*  implement that deal [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=561.26s)]
*  And and I think the urgency is in part around the Rafa invasion [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=562.86s)]
*  You want to try to this is the last window perhaps to do this [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=566.48s)]
*  I think there's an assumption that a bunch of those hostages are probably in Rafa [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=570.02s)]
*  And so once you start a military operation there that you know [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=575.58s)]
*  The chaos and violence of that obviously makes it, you know more difficult to negotiate something and may put the hostages at risk [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=579.02s)]
*  We don't know how these hostages have been killed [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=584.9399999999999s)]
*  Let's hope it works out. I think we should have like a heavy dose of caution [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=587.42s)]
*  With the optimism because so many things can go wrong here. The only thing I want to say [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=592.1s)]
*  That [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=598.66s)]
*  Off of Tony's clip. I obviously agree [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=599.78s)]
*  With the onus being on Hamas in the terms of this negotiation [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=602.9s)]
*  I get a little uncomfortable when the there's a underlying [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=606.3s)]
*  Logic that if Hamas doesn't agree to the deal [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=611.18s)]
*  Well, then the Rafa thing will go forward in the sense that the Rafa invasion shouldn't go forward anyway [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=614.3s)]
*  it's a bad idea and this is and this is we've gotten into a bit of a challenge here is that [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=620.24s)]
*  The the it's not as if this military operation is all well and good [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=625.3s)]
*  If Hamas doesn't agree to these hostage releases because again purely on the equity the hostages it's not resting the hostages [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=630.3s)]
*  Never mind. Obviously the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. And so I do worry a little bit about [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=637.06s)]
*  Like a logic train [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=642.4599999999999s)]
*  Maybe unwittingly being set up that if there's no deal [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=644.3399999999999s)]
*  Well, then, you know, there's no choice but to continue this pretty cataclysmic military a good point [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=647.5s)]
*  And it's worth remembering that you know [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=652.9s)]
*  The last temporary ceasefire deal was in November and then Hamas released 105 hostages in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=654.58s)]
*  That was the last time there was any significant release of prisoners and over the weekend Hamas released a hostage video [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=662.14s)]
*  Featuring two hostages as proof of life. So it does there are some sort of like this stuff [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=667.5400000000001s)]
*  There's clearly stuff that they're circling closer to some kind of deal [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=672.0200000000001s)]
*  Which would again would be great and and in addition to getting hostages out and getting aid in I [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=675.58s)]
*  The rationale does hold that you know [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=682.0600000000001s)]
*  You want to use that calm to try to make something more durable in terms of a ceasefire [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=684.9000000000001s)]
*  The other deal that's being constantly circled in the press is this potential normalization of relations between the Saudi government and the Israeli government? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=689.4200000000001s)]
*  This deal as reported would include the US providing like a NATO like security guarantee to defend Saudi Arabia in the end of a tech [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=698.0600000000001s)]
*  The US would also provide them with some sort of civilian nuclear program in return the Saudis would normalize relations with Israel and generally [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=706.0600000000001s)]
*  agree to reduce their ties with China and Russia and then [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=713.1800000000001s)]
*  Israel is supposed to commit to what the New York Times described as a quote concrete plan for an eventual Palestinian state [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=716.34s)]
*  We don't know exactly what that means [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=723.0600000000001s)]
*  We you know, you and I pressed Tony Blinken on this on this show a while back before October 7th [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=724.4200000000001s)]
*  You know, he seemed to really want to assert that it was a firm commitment of some sort [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=730.0600000000001s)]
*  But wouldn't say what exactly? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=735.14s)]
*  Here's where things get weird Ben [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=737.18s)]
*  So ha ha Retz reported that Saudi Arabia has already decided to normalize relations with Israel [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=738.5s)]
*  But it's trying to decide whether to do it during the Biden administration or to wait for Trump to be back in office [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=744.3199999999999s)]
*  Basically, the sourcing is very thin on this article [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=748.86s)]
*  It's to an unnamed foreign diplomat and then there was a report in the Times that suggested sort of the opposite [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=752.1s)]
*  It said that the Saudis are eager to get a deal done and they want to do it as soon as they can [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=758.5s)]
*  Because they're worried about getting it through Congress and if Trump is elected, they don't think Democrats will vote for a Saudi normalization deal [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=762.5s)]
*  But everyone is waiting for Netanyahu to agree on whatever concessions are required around the Palestinian state [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=770.1s)]
*  So then a couple things like one, I mean, I guess I still I'm call me a cynic [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=776.0s)]
*  I still don't really see the political path for Netanyahu to get these real concessions [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=780.54s)]
*  Because I think his ultra right-wing ultra religious [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=785.5s)]
*  Coalition cares more about controlling the West Bank than they do taking a trip to Mecca Medina [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=789.52s)]
*  You know relations with with Saudi Arabia. But second, I mean, I'm trying to put aside my [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=795.0s)]
*  my anti-netanyahu [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=801.2399999999999s)]
*  anti-MBS derangement syndrome, which I have [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=803.3199999999999s)]
*  and just [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=806.16s)]
*  figure out what [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=807.88s)]
*  Makes this deal worth it sort of in in US interests because obviously agreeing to a security guarantee for Saudi Arabia [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=809.56s)]
*  Is no small thing nor is providing them civilian [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=817.16s)]
*  nuclear infrastructure [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=821.24s)]
*  Obviously if this deal [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=823.76s)]
*  Got Israel to agree to the creation of a Palestinian state with borders and territory and concessions and all the things we think it would [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=825.88s)]
*  Take to make it workable. That would be amazing. But how does that get decided without any Palestinian input in these talks? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=832.48s)]
*  So that's my big question [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=837.76s)]
*  Yeah, I on this one. I you know another [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=840.0799999999999s)]
*  Heavy dose of caution because we keep hearing that we're on the precipice of this agreement [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=844.36s)]
*  I do think that in before times right before October 7th, I think you know, Saudi Arabia did want this deal [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=850.12s)]
*  I mean that was pretty clear because they were gonna get so much out of it, you know [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=857.8000000000001s)]
*  They were gonna get a NATO security guarantee. They're gonna not NATO but a NATO like security guarantee [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=861.4s)]
*  They're gonna get a nuclear program [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=867.32s)]
*  They're gonna get probably a whole bunch of arms and shipments and things like that [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=870.08s)]
*  Kind of the permanent get out of jail free card for MBS not that he needs it [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=874.08s)]
*  And I do you know, I heard from a variety of people [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=878.32s)]
*  Over the last year that the Saudi logic was the thing that was in the Times report that essentially if they're ever gonna make these deals [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=883.6400000000001s)]
*  That require congressional approval and it has security guarantee would certainly require congressional approval [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=891.32s)]
*  Their judgment was it better to do with the Democratic president because if you know Democrats are less inclined [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=898.12s)]
*  I think to vote for we have a good government gene [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=904.84s)]
*  Yeah, you have a gene of like do we really want to commit to the defense of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=907.08s)]
*  forever and [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=912.28s)]
*  And so they they felt that Democrats wouldn't want to go against the priority of a Democratic president [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=914.2s)]
*  Republicans would want to just circle the wagons with MBS and [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=920.8000000000001s)]
*  Better do it now it does just feel like they're trying to hit some crazy air gap here though, right because [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=924.8s)]
*  It's you're not gonna do this right before the election. It's already May like what landing this plane [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=930.9599999999999s)]
*  Feels tough tough [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=938.24s)]
*  Because number one I'm not sold that we should be giving the Saudis all these things number two [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=940.48s)]
*  I just don't see BB is not at for Palestinian state [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=945.8399999999999s)]
*  And so I just don't understand what credible formulation he's gonna agree to and then [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=949.68s)]
*  Absent any formulation of Palestinian state. I [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=955.92s)]
*  Begins to be hard to see what the Saudis are gonna get. I also don't know what the US can [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=958.68s)]
*  Substantively get on this China Russia point neither [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=963.12s)]
*  I mean they could make statements like we'll be friends with you better than them [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=965.3599999999999s)]
*  But you know [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=969.04s)]
*  They're gonna align with the Chinese and Russians on things that they think are in their interest and they certainly kind of can't give us [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=970.0s)]
*  Permanent guarantees, maybe they can be like well, we'll stop buying Huawei for a little while [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=975.88s)]
*  But you know five years from now they could buy it and so I just think that this whole thing. I'm I [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=980.0s)]
*  We've always been Abraham Accord skeptics here [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=986.32s)]
*  If we've learned one thing [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=989.52s)]
*  I think what we've learned is that the pathway to peace and harmony in the Middle East is not through the Abraham Accords a bunch [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=991.02s)]
*  of normalization deals between a far-right Israeli government and some autocrats like I [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=997.2s)]
*  I'm less than enthusiastic that this is the place to be putting all our chips [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1001.6800000000001s)]
*  But hey, we'll see if they pull a rabbit out of a hat [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1005.44s)]
*  Yeah, if TDS is Trump derangement syndrome is MBS derangement syndrome MBS DS [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1007.9200000000001s)]
*  So we have [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1014.2800000000001s)]
*  Maybe yes D. Yes, it is [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1016.96s)]
*  Well, but like this makes it pointed like success here is giving like a NATO like security guarantee to Saudi Arabia [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1021.24s)]
*  Which like you know before October 7th, I think a lot of us were like, yeah, I'm not so sure about that, you know [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1029.12s)]
*  Just feels like a lot feels like a lot and complicating all of this are reports that the International Criminal Court or ICC [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1035.32s)]
*  Maybe on the cusp of issuing arrest warrants for top Israeli leaders including maybe Netanyahu along with several Hamas leaders [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1041.06s)]
*  So we'll keep an eye on that [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1048.9199999999998s)]
*  We should note that there are reports that more aid is getting into Gaza, which is good [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1050.0s)]
*  It is still too early to say if the famine concerns have gone away [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1054.16s)]
*  But there are reports that more trucks are getting in also the u.s [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1058.06s)]
*  Has started building that floating pier to deliver relief to Gaza which is projected to cost about 320 million dollars [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1061.16s)]
*  Would be nice if BB would let us save that money and spend it on just you know [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1067.56s)]
*  Yeah trucks [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1072.8400000000001s)]
*  Also been on May 8th the president Biden has to certify to Congress whether Israel is complying with us and international law [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1074.52s)]
*  With respect to the use of us provided arms [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1080.44s)]
*  There's a lot of reports out there that lawyers are skeptical that they are [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1084.0s)]
*  Politico reported that there's a bunch of lawyers including 20 people that work in the Biden administration [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1087.8s)]
*  That are calling on Biden to halt aid BZ IDF is not complying [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1092.2s)]
*  Reuters reported that senior officials and government have told Tony Blinken that they don't believe [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1096.8s)]
*  Israeli assurances about complying with international law are true [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1101.1200000000001s)]
*  So probably some intense meetings happening right now a lot and this just shows that you know [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1105.08s)]
*  There are consequences for actions you can't just say we're in an accountability free world and and that you can do what? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1110.36s)]
*  Israel's been doing in Gaza for [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1116.8s)]
*  Six months and that the ICC won't notice or that US law [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1120.52s)]
*  Deadlines are gonna be ignored. You know, there should be accountability like if you create a world without accountability [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1125.08s)]
*  well, you know, it's more likely that that bad things are gonna happen here and [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1132.72s)]
*  I just don't know, you know, we we [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1137.04s)]
*  this gets to the rafa thing too in the sense of [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1140.56s)]
*  Blaming Hamas is [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1146.2s)]
*  Absolutely important and essential for Hamas's responsibility for October 7th and for obviously the hostages [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1148.2s)]
*  It's also the case that things like letting humanitarian aid in are not gifts. They're they're requirements [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1154.8799999999999s)]
*  You know under international law you're required to allow this aid. You're under US law. You're required to you know comply with [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1161.48s)]
*  restrictions against war crimes like these are not novel things and and and you know, we're seeing [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1169.56s)]
*  You're gonna have consequences if you if you undertake the kind of military operation that Israel has yeah [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1177.2s)]
*  Last thing in Gaza. So last week [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1182.76s)]
*  We talked about protests that have been popping up on college campuses across the US in opposition to [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1184.32s)]
*  US support for the war in Gaza or just the war generally [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1189.8s)]
*  We got some great feedback from listeners including from some students at schools like Columbia [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1192.84s)]
*  And NYU who had attended protests and in many cases were frustrated at how they were being portrayed in the media [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1198.3999999999999s)]
*  So to hear from some of these protesters directly we reached out to the brilliant and talented Jordan Waller [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1205.9199999999998s)]
*  Jordan is a former Pod Save the World producer [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1211.76s)]
*  She's now in school at NYU and she agreed to interview some NYU and City University of New York protesters on our behalf [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1214.08s)]
*  But here is a compilation of some of what they had to say [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1222.4799999999998s)]
*  I got involved in the movement because I care deeply about freedom of speech [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1225.82s)]
*  So whether you are on one side or the other side of this issue [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1230.98s)]
*  I think it's really important that people be able to put up posters tear down posters shout things [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1234.42s)]
*  I think that freedom of speech is a critical property of the university and that's how I got involved [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1240.6200000000001s)]
*  I think what's happening right now at the media is they're either [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1246.1000000000001s)]
*  Characterizing this as a free speech issue or as an anti-war protest and I think both of those are wrong [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1249.5800000000002s)]
*  We are here as a part of a liberation movement for the freedom of Palestinians and the end to the genocide in Gaza [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1254.8s)]
*  We don't think that we're solving conflict in the Middle East through protesting [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1260.84s)]
*  We don't think that that's what's gonna happen regardless of any one conflict. Why would our [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1265.64s)]
*  Endowment be invested in weapons manufacturers and defense contractors [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1271.92s)]
*  Why would the CEO of Black Rock be on our board of directors? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1276.32s)]
*  Why you know, why are we operating a campus and what is currently a war zone? [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1280.52s)]
*  We're all religious Jews and we all as the our brothers and sisters in Palestine from the Jewish community [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1285.3200000000002s)]
*  extremely [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1293.6000000000001s)]
*  Religious therefore we are extremely opposed to the Zionist occupation its entirety [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1295.0800000000002s)]
*  We will never recognize the legitimacy of the existence of the state of Israel and what they're doing is horrendous and beyond words [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1299.68s)]
*  And we don't have enough words to describe our hurt and our sorrow and our sympathy for the people of Palestine and Gaza [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1307.28s)]
*  We have broader aims as well get get a free Q&A to get [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1313.36s)]
*  To make sure you know labor relations are better make sure staff being paid properly get rid of the you know [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1318.12s)]
*  The adjunctification of the university where you've got these people working short-term contracts being paid nothing [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1323.9199999999998s)]
*  We see that struggle that class struggle as part of what is going on in Palestine and the history of Palestine is also a class struggle [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1330.04s)]
*  Very very glad to be here as part of intergenerational [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1337.36s)]
*  Solidarity to see the young people to see the students what they're doing and showing the way [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1341.3999999999999s)]
*  If the unity between the Jewish students and Palestinian students is just it shows the future [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1347.1599999999999s)]
*  So you get some students got some teachers as you could hear Ben [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1354.1599999999999s)]
*  There's a range of different reasons for why people are involved in the protests [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1357.4799999999998s)]
*  Some of them are very focused on ending the war in Gaza Gaza others have broader frustrations with [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1360.4799999999998s)]
*  School leadership or the government of Israel or even [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1366.42s)]
*  Local labor issues. I like my guy because actually, you know my first job at a college. I was an adjunct [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1370.5s)]
*  Oh really CUNY professor and I was a member dues paying member of DC 37 Union and nice [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1375.4s)]
*  I have good benefits that dudes fighting for you that's yeah, I do a bank shot [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1380.5s)]
*  I need guys later still doing a lot of junk dishes. But yeah, yeah anyway, so like I should note as we're recording this [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1384.8600000000001s)]
*  Things have taken a violent turn in other places [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1391.5s)]
*  Students at Columbia broke into and are now occupying a building there [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1394.14s)]
*  There's been a wave of arrests at schools all across the country including something got really violent like the cops in them with the Texas [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1398.3s)]
*  There's being a shit out of yeah [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1404.74s)]
*  Professor that got beat up in Georgia pretty nasty [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1406.58s)]
*  But I think that clip we just played gives you a sense of what you might hear from [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1408.62s)]
*  thoughtful well-meaning protesters who you might totally disagree with at these New York schools [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1413.78s)]
*  But also maybe some who would benefit from being I think a little more focused in their demands, but that's just my opinion [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1419.58s)]
*  Yeah, I think one of the useful [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1425.9s)]
*  Parts of that exercise is just getting a sense of the diversity of reasons that people are protesting. I mean [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1428.74s)]
*  everybody seems to want to look at these protests and paint it with one brush like I [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1435.42s)]
*  100% support all these people or all these people are any semites or these people and get it because of extra these people and get it [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1440.66s)]
*  Because the reality is if you have a bunch of protests in a place like New York City and then all over the country like [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1446.52s)]
*  There's gonna be a lot of different kinds of people out there and there can be some a lot of really well-meaning people and a [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1452.32s)]
*  Handful of people handful of views a handful people that are assholes and a handful of people with views that you you find abhorrent [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1456.92s)]
*  but like [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1463.26s)]
*  you know the the core message here, I think is I [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1464.08s)]
*  Think free speech is important and needs to be protected [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1468.24s)]
*  I do think that you know the war in Gaza if there wasn't a war like that going on you wouldn't see this kind of [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1471.04s)]
*  Mobilization and so there's at core even though there are all these other issues that are coming into play [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1477.12s)]
*  It's it's fundamentally about I think you know at core people raising legitimate questions about why is the US providing the support and [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1481.4s)]
*  And you know what kind of policies and universities? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1490.28s)]
*  interact with this issue and can we have some dialogue about it and and where everybody gets into trouble is [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1493.48s)]
*  When they are kind of [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1499.48s)]
*  Insisting on [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1502.68s)]
*  the the total delegitimization of the people they don't agree with and so obviously [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1504.44s)]
*  You know I think people cracking down on protesters and trying to shut them up and trying to clear encampments right away [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1509.44s)]
*  Is not constructive [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1515.6000000000001s)]
*  it nor is it necessary constructive to go smash a bunch of windows and take over a building and and [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1518.08s)]
*  And not kind of engage in some dialogue, right? I mean everybody needs to kind of hear each other [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1523.28s)]
*  I have a bias towards supporting protests generally [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1527.76s)]
*  Not just because my views on this particular issue [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1532.6s)]
*  But because I think it's like if you try to shut young people up [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1534.4s)]
*  I think we saw what happens like then they feel like they're not heard and they're actually gonna protest more or their views are [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1537.8s)]
*  Gonna become more inflexible like we need to have outlet for people to be heard and to try to influence policy [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1542.4s)]
*  And the last thing I I'd say Tommy I was thinking about this a lot [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1548.96s)]
*  You know we you mentioned this last week in protest. It's meant to be inconvenient [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1551.8s)]
*  You know like that that's part of what it does and I think we as Americans have to recognize [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1556.76s)]
*  Including a lot of these Republicans and some of the Democrats who are on a very high horse kind of talking down to protesters [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1562.28s)]
*  You know when there's a protest movement in another country that we see as an adversary. We're usually all for it, right? [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1569.04s)]
*  Mm-hmm. I was a big supporter of the Hong Kong protest movement. Yeah for well over a year. They shut down airports [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1574.56s)]
*  They shut down business districts. They you know [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1581.4s)]
*  I'm sure you could find people inside the Hong Kong protests who were bad actors [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1584.28s)]
*  But by and large we're like here's some people weren't making their voices heard. That's a good thing [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1588.52s)]
*  We have to apply that at home, too [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1592.64s)]
*  You know, right and look there's lines that you can't cross like Charlottesville like, you know [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1594.24s)]
*  there's little violence and they're really running people violence is clearly a line and and but but [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1598.4s)]
*  We have this I you know, I really don't like this [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1603.8400000000001s)]
*  The sense that we can't hear this stuff, you know that that we don't like certain [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1608.24s)]
*  Chance or in like it's part of being in a free society [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1612.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I think once a movement like this starts like the toothpaste is out of the tube, right? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1616.64s)]
*  This thing is now growing and no one controls it and it also becomes a magnet for people [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1620.84s)]
*  Who are maybe just on the fringe and have other issues and God knows what they're doing and saying at some of these New York events [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1625.88s)]
*  I also think free speech is like just unequivocally necessary and [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1631.72s)]
*  The anti-semitism we've seen especially at some of these New York protests is really bad and really bad [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1635.64s)]
*  Is really bad and really worrisome and needs to be condemned and fought [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1641.08s)]
*  but I'm equally worried about the US government getting involved in trying to [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1645.3999999999999s)]
*  shut down curtail in any way a bridge free speech because it's just a bedrock principle and we can't [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1651.04s)]
*  We can't curtail speech when we don't like it and then demand that it be heard when we do, right? [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1657.6s)]
*  So, I mean that's like the giant hypocrisy of these Republicans. They're like, yes and Milo Yiannopoulos and Ben Shapiro to every campus [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1663.36s)]
*  But God to provoke some snowflakes, right? Yeah [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1670.0s)]
*  I mean any semitism issue should be dealt with too is like, you know a matter of what are your protocols? [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1672.4s)]
*  What how are you dealing with? I'll say protocol [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1677.4s)]
*  Well, but like you guys talked about this up to you say protocol being just yeah, no, but I did be specific [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1681.24s)]
*  Like if some guy says, you know [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1688.48s)]
*  He wants to kill all Zionists. Like is there does that cross some line that triggers? [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1691.6000000000001s)]
*  The problem is this is all ad hoc, you know, it's all like, you know [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1696.4399999999998s)]
*  You kind of see it and assess it based on the moment and clearly, you know, there needs to be greater transparency about [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1700.32s)]
*  rules and [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1706.52s)]
*  expectations [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1708.12s)]
*  All that said though [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1709.24s)]
*  again, I think you have to [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1712.1999999999998s)]
*  You you have to be comfortable being uncomfortable, you know on this issue [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1715.0s)]
*  everybody wants to kind of bathe in the comfort of people agree with them and and I think the [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1720.56s)]
*  value of students is that they make power uncomfortable and like ultimately that's the good thing about protests and [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1726.1999999999998s)]
*  And you know to put on the kind of world-oh-hat here for a second. It's wrong to have like police, you know [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1732.3999999999999s)]
*  wrestling [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1739.24s)]
*  Professors to the ground in Georgia or like rolling [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1740.96s)]
*  Horses into crowds in Texas as we've seen if you're not to be super online to have consumes some of this content [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1744.24s)]
*  Don't think for a second by the way that that kind of imagery is not gonna be repurposed by oh, yeah a Putin [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1749.4399999999998s)]
*  Xi Jinping a Modi already see it's all the same. They you know, and and you know, that's just the reality here [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1756.0s)]
*  We get on this high horse about democratic values [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1762.52s)]
*  Well, we have to we have to model them here at home and the way in which some of these protests have been dealt with [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1764.82s)]
*  It does not feel consistent with democratic values. No, no, it does not [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1769.72s)]
*  But thank you again Jordan for yes as always for interviewing all this folks for us making us smarter per usual [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1773.32s)]
*  Okay, a couple updates from Russia [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1778.84s)]
*  So first the Wall Street Journal reported that US intelligence agencies have concluded that Vladimir Putin did not order [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1780.3999999999999s)]
*  The execution murder or whatever you want to call it of anti-corruption activists and opposition leader Alexei Navalny [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1788.84s)]
*  Obviously that does not absolve Putin of responsibility his goons tried to poison the guy multiple times did poison the guy multiple times [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1794.9599999999998s)]
*  But it was an interesting conclusion and interesting to me that it leaked Ben. I don't know what you thought about that [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1802.4399999999998s)]
*  also, you know in an odd sign of [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1807.6399999999999s)]
*  Just how strange Putin's Russia can be both people close to Navalny and Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1810.36s)]
*  Basically dismissed the report as stupid and ridiculous [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1817.36s)]
*  And then so it's also worth noting at the same time to journalists [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1820.9199999999998s)]
*  Were recently detained in Russia for allegedly producing YouTube content for Navalny's YouTube channel [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1824.6s)]
*  Both have also worked as stringers for international outlets like the AP and Reuters [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1829.6799999999998s)]
*  Meanwhile our buddy Tucker Carlson is back on the Russia beat this time [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1834.4s)]
*  He interviewed a guy named Alexander Dugan who's a far-right Russian philosopher who's been called Putin's brain [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1839.48s)]
*  Tucker framed his decision to talk to a bloodthirsty [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1845.64s)]
*  Nationalist by claiming Dugan's ideas were so dangerous that his books were banned and you can't buy them on Amazon [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1848.96s)]
*  The Daily Beast's checked out this claim and they found that of course it's bullshit [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1854.76s)]
*  And you can buy at least four of Dugan's books on Amazon right now [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1859.6399999999999s)]
*  Including one that's been translated into English for your Kindle [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1862.9599999999998s)]
*  The interview is so weird and rambly that we couldn't even figure out how to excerpt it [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1866.04s)]
*  So we will spare you that audio [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1869.5s)]
*  But Dugan seems to think that liberalism and transgender people will lead us to a future ruled by AI robots [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1871.32s)]
*  So get excited for that Ben. Are you as jealous as I am that Tucker's just like owning this beat? I [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1877.98s)]
*  Mean not jealous of hanging out with Dugan. He doesn't seem like a good guy [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1885.3999999999999s)]
*  jealous of his lovely time in the Moscow Metro, that's true as we [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1889.52s)]
*  I mean, I I [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1893.48s)]
*  Think that the Dugan thing. This is a guy who literally thinks Putin is not like right-wing enough, right? This is a guy that [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1895.48s)]
*  Is you know to and I think probably what brought Tucker to him is, you know, his daughter was assassinated [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1902.96s)]
*  By the Ukrainians. Yeah, and so trucker loves kind of like hoisting the Ukrainians on their petard [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1911.16s)]
*  But this guy's just a bunch of [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1917.84s)]
*  Bullshit, you know, it's a bunch of like ultra nationalist, you know, justifying a fascism [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1920.8799999999999s)]
*  It's not like some deep thinker, you know, who's doing his own research about vaccines [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1925.72s)]
*  You know like this is a guy that like propagates in ideologies that are designed to get people killed, you know and this kind of [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1930.0s)]
*  Dance with the far right that put Tucker's doing globally [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1938.4399999999998s)]
*  It just kind of continues to reinforce that there really is an ideology that has kind of come together [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1942.24s)]
*  And it's kind of a weird pastiche at core. It's like a white [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1946.84s)]
*  Supremacist right-wing Christian ideology, but it's weird how it's very 21st century and that like they're mad about cancel culture [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1951.1999999999998s)]
*  one in trans rights and LGBT and and [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1959.1999999999998s)]
*  NATO and you know [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1962.32s)]
*  It is kind of a Christmas tree of of just like far-right grievance at Tucker likes [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1963.52s)]
*  Yeah [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1967.56s)]
*  And then if only thing chose the danger of it because I don't really care whether Putin like ordered [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1967.8s)]
*  Like that he be killed on ex-date he killed Navalny by poisoning him wrongfully detaining him [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1972.78s)]
*  Having him moving around this prison system [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1980.38s)]
*  Finally ending up in the Arctic Circle. He wasn't you know getting fed [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1983.5s)]
*  I'm sure that you know [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1986.52s)]
*  You weren't gonna get ahead in the Russian prison system by like giving Alexi and of all me a blanket [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1987.82s)]
*  You know [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1992.6000000000001s)]
*  We're gonna get ahead by beating the shit out of him and denying him food and Putin created the apparatus that that [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1993.0s)]
*  Deliberately killed Alexi and of all me and so to me that's kind of almost a sideshow. Yeah, there's weird that it leaked [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=1999.04s)]
*  I mean you never know how anything leaks, but it's just sort of surprising. Yeah. Yeah, it is like [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2004.24s)]
*  Yeah, I because it's not like we're on the verge of some rat-poaching mom with Putin [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2010.76s)]
*  So I seem like something would be closely held anyway [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2014.24s)]
*  Russia was also a big topic of discussion during Secretary of State Tony Blinken's recent visit to China [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2017.0s)]
*  Where he met with Chinese President Xi Jinping and other top Chinese officials the Biden administration [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2022.84s)]
*  Is increasingly frustrated about China supporting Russia's weapons industry and supporting their war effort [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2028.24s)]
*  Here's a clip from Tony doing a press conference during this visit to China [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2034.0800000000002s)]
*  I reiterated our serious concern about the PRC providing components that are powering Russia's brutal war of aggression against Ukraine [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2038.0600000000002s)]
*  China's the top supplier of machine tools [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2046.6000000000001s)]
*  microelectronics [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2049.96s)]
*  Nitrocellulose which is critical to making munitions and rocket propellants and other dual-use items that Moscow is using [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2051.36s)]
*  to ramp up its defense industrial base a [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2057.48s)]
*  defense industrial base that is churning out rockets drones tanks and [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2060.48s)]
*  Other weapons that President Putin is using to invade a sovereign country to demolish its power grid and other civilian infrastructure [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2064.28s)]
*  to kill innocent children women and men [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2071.28s)]
*  Russia would struggle to sustain its assault on Ukraine without China's support [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2075.1200000000003s)]
*  In my meetings with NATO allies earliest month and with our g7 partners just last week [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2081.32s)]
*  I heard that same message [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2086.16s)]
*  Fueling Russia's defense industrial base not only threatens Ukrainian security. It threatens European security [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2088.52s)]
*  Beijing cannot achieve better relations with Europe [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2095.4s)]
*  While supporting the greatest threat to European security since the end of the Cold War [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2098.24s)]
*  Message seems to be like stop this or we're gonna sanction you [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2102.56s)]
*  Kind of my takeaway [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2106.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2108.12s)]
*  except I [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2109.7599999999998s)]
*  does [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2111.2s)]
*  Beijing give a shit, you know like that like that [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2112.68s)]
*  I mean, this is the like two years ago when the sanctions regime went in place [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2114.7999999999997s)]
*  I think one thing that a bunch of smart analysts said including on this podcast is [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2118.64s)]
*  That what was gonna create a huge opportunity for China in a way because China doesn't like the way us uses sanctions to begin with [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2123.3599999999997s)]
*  and they could basically [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2130.8799999999997s)]
*  by ignoring our sanctions by a lot of Russian oil on the cheap and then kind of turn Russian into a client state because Russia is [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2133.3599999999997s)]
*  Wholly dependent on China for technology [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2140.56s)]
*  And so it's there's a lot of advantages for China in this. I don't like it. Mm-hmm [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2143.9599999999996s)]
*  Like I wish they weren't doing it. Yeah [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2149.52s)]
*  But the reality is they're not gonna respond to kind of a moral appeal, you know [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2152.56s)]
*  We're you know, Russia's using these inputs to to attack Ukraine [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2157.9199999999996s)]
*  And so then it's pressure and I think what Tony was trying to kind of indicate is it's not just us [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2162.04s)]
*  Europeans to they don't like this and [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2168.12s)]
*  Presumably like there might be some sanction of [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2172.32s)]
*  Certain Chinese entities that are providing maybe some of those things that Tony listed [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2175.6400000000003s)]
*  Like I think that specific list was a warning shot and he probably delivered in private to like hey [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2179.6800000000003s)]
*  There may be some company that is providing X, you know input to the Russian economy. They could be sanctioned [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2184.36s)]
*  but at the end of the day [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2190.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm increasingly the view Tommy that [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2192.7200000000003s)]
*  We need to find ways that are not just pressure, you know to deal with the Chinese in particular because [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2196.0800000000004s)]
*  What's the incentive for them to not do this you like and yeah, everything same squishy and you know [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2205.0400000000004s)]
*  do you know unit comparison but like if [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2211.6800000000003s)]
*  everything is the u.s. Going around the world telling people not to do things and sanctioning them and then what's happening is an entire parallel [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2214.0400000000004s)]
*  Global economy is developing that has been built to avoid US sanctions and [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2221.08s)]
*  They're big countries in that like China and like a wrong big energy producer and a lot of other countries are you know? [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2225.8s)]
*  India that ignores our sanctions even though they're you know [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2232.52s)]
*  Our partner and some other things and at a certain point like you have to have some you know to put on my blob hat [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2235.52s)]
*  There's got to be some carrots, you know [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2242.88s)]
*  You know not just sticks if you want to achieve your objective here, which is it? [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2244.92s)]
*  China's not going to be scolded into not doing this [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2249.44s)]
*  Let me never chamber chamber in your Munich agreement real quick because this trip also came [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2251.8s)]
*  Just after Biden signed into law this foreign aid bill that included eight billion to counter China and Indo-Pacific [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2256.68s)]
*  That was billions in military funding for Taiwan [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2261.96s)]
*  And then there was the tick-tock ban piece of this without requires the tick-tock be sold or spun off by its Chinese parent company [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2264.94s)]
*  So I'm like I'm glad Tony made the trip where we have to fix relations that haven't been right since the stupid [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2271.68s)]
*  Bullshit right I [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2278.0s)]
*  Obviously don't want China to support the Russian invasion of Ukraine either and I want Taiwan to be able to live as an autonomous [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2279.92s)]
*  I want the next to win the NBA championship, but like you and I were talking about this the other day [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2286.84s)]
*  This conversation in the Western media gets framed as the US responding to Chinese aggression in the Pacific and of course that is true [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2291.96s)]
*  China has they have an absurd interpretation of their territorial waters and they claim half of the South China Sea for no reason [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2298.12s)]
*  They've been building military bases out of islands the Chinese quote-unquote Coast Guard keeps attacking [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2305.6s)]
*  Filipino Navy boats and that's gonna lead to a conflict if we're not careful [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2311.36s)]
*  But I think if you just imagine you were Xi Jinping for a minute [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2315.7599999999998s)]
*  He's probably thinking I'm responding to American aggression because the US has 28,000 US troops in South Korea [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2318.98s)]
*  50,000 in Japan. We got a base in Guam now the US is sending Tomahawk missiles to Okinawa [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2326.4s)]
*  We just negotiated access to all these [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2332.2799999999997s)]
*  Air and naval bases in the Philippines. There's US Marines in Australia [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2335.12s)]
*  Thanks to Barack Obama and now Biden just negotiated this big AUKUS submarine deal [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2340.24s)]
*  We're sending our nuclear subs down at the Pacific region. And so I'm not saying it's wrong to do these things [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2344.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm not criticizing Biden for doing them [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2350.3999999999996s)]
*  But I'm just saying like when you look at all those US military assets laid out on a map [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2352.3599999999997s)]
*  You can see why China feels like they're being encircled because they are [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2357.2s)]
*  And that doesn't justify invading Taiwan or sinking a Filipino fishing boat [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2361.56s)]
*  But it does make you wonder is the US Navy presence deterring China or is it scaring them into bolstering? [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2366.44s)]
*  Bolstering their own military hardware [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2372.92s)]
*  Yeah [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2375.08s)]
*  and I think the answer to that has to be like a more of a focus on diplomacy and [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2375.48s)]
*  Frankly, even some transactionalism with the Chinese [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2380.36s)]
*  Yeah, I think she you know to what we should come back to this because it's a really important kind of probably under [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2383.6s)]
*  discussed [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2390.32s)]
*  Giant tectonic plate underneath the world because people in folks on Ukraine in the Middle East [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2391.8s)]
*  But essentially I think I do think Xi Jinping came in and he was a particularly aggressive Chinese leader [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2397.76s)]
*  Pressing those claims in the South China Sea harder like being bit more of a hard-ass at home [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2404.1200000000003s)]
*  Being a hard-ass across the board and so the US was going to react to that by becoming a little more hard-ass and ourselves [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2409.2400000000002s)]
*  but [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2414.88s)]
*  For people listening who don't follow the intricacies of kind of the foreign policy establishment debates [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2415.84s)]
*  There was this kind of collective decision made [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2421.6000000000004s)]
*  Kind of during the Trump years actually that it was wrong to engage China. We need to become much more hawkish [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2424.84s)]
*  We made all these miscalculations that China would become more [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2431.44s)]
*  warm and cuddly of WTO session [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2435.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2437.44s)]
*  Is that and and and that there was a lot to that that was correct like it was the case that it was wrong that [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2437.84s)]
*  You know opening up and you know working with China a bunch of stuff would lead to them liberalizing their system or something [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2443.64s)]
*  But I think we have now over corrected a bit here, you know, like and it's very good [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2449.2s)]
*  But we you know that Biden people kind of reengaged and Biden did a meeting with Xi Jinping late last year Tony just went out [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2454.88s)]
*  There but at a certain point there has to be a positive agenda. What are we working on? [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2460.72s)]
*  Are we negotiating things or we're negotiating around AI? We're negotiating around climate change [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2464.52s)]
*  we're negotiating around the global economy like this can't just be a like [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2468.8s)]
*  We have a list of things that we demand the Chinese do and they have a list of things that they demand we do [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2472.52s)]
*  That's a recipe for kind of conflict. There needs to be some some some positivity in the relationship [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2477.08s)]
*  Yeah last piece of this from this China trip [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2482.92s)]
*  So Tony strip also took place of the with another backdrop all these espionage cases in England and Germany [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2486.08s)]
*  There's been a total of six people who have been charged with spying for China and there's growing evidence [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2492.2s)]
*  That China is attempting to influence the upcoming US presidential election [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2497.2799999999997s)]
*  So China is being accused of using spies to influence the democratic processes in Europe [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2501.12s)]
*  Something China experts say is not new but that awareness of it is growing [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2506.6s)]
*  Tony was asked about reports of a China's attempt to meddle in the US elections by using fake social media accounts [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2511.04s)]
*  To bolster support for Trump and whether he thought this violated President Xi's commitment [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2517.48s)]
*  He had this to say to CNN's Kylie I would president Biden was very clear about that with President Xi and [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2522.76s)]
*  I repeated that today in in my meetings you repeat what that any interference [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2529.52s)]
*  by China [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2536.64s)]
*  In our election is something that we're looking very carefully at and is totally unacceptable to us [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2538.0s)]
*  Look, it's something we're tracking very carefully. I can't speak to these [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2544.7599999999998s)]
*  Specific reports I can say that as a general matter [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2548.2s)]
*  We've been very clear with China. Don't do it, but they're not violating the commitment yet as far as you can tell [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2552.24s)]
*  Well, again, I'd have to look at the specific reports that that you're referring to but we have seen [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2557.48s)]
*  generally speaking [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2563.2400000000002s)]
*  evidence of attempts to [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2565.52s)]
*  Influence and [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2569.0s)]
*  Arguably interfere and we want to make sure that that's cut off as quickly as possible [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2571.28s)]
*  Kylie I would from dead a mass by the way. No, no big deal [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2575.96s)]
*  No big deal there happen my city then if every country decides to interfere in our elections [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2579.68s)]
*  Do they accidentally cancel each other out? What do you think? I mean in an open information space, you know [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2584.34s)]
*  This is more normalized and I think [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2591.94s)]
*  China's become more aggressive in kind of information and disinformation campaigns and [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2594.98s)]
*  It's quite likely that they're bringing that into our election, you know [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2600.0200000000004s)]
*  And the question is at what scale with what intent a big a deal a big a deal. I mean ironically I [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2603.86s)]
*  Genuinely believe that the Chinese would prefer Trump to win because while he's an unpredictable actor who talks [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2611.66s)]
*  You know trash about China [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2618.58s)]
*  he also has kind of a man crush on Xi Jinping and is so disruptive and [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2620.8599999999997s)]
*  Erratic that he's the best thing for China in terms of their [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2626.8599999999997s)]
*  Desire to build a parallel world order, right their desire to go to Europe and say the Americans are too dysfunctional deal with us [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2630.7799999999997s)]
*  Their desire to take things like the bricks and build it in the institution [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2637.3399999999997s)]
*  So I'm sure the Biden people seen sounds like they're seeing some stuff that is probably in the information space [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2640.58s)]
*  But you hear, you know Tony's warning and then it's kind of like well or what like what is the US gonna do? [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2647.7799999999997s)]
*  If they see this so they're gonna call it [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2653.66s)]
*  I think calling out is important but be at some point and I'm sympathetic to Tony [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2655.7999999999997s)]
*  We've all been there at some point though. You're gonna have to be specific [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2659.62s)]
*  I think naming what the interference is is is step one and then if it continues then you consider what consequences [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2662.78s)]
*  Yeah, and if it's just Twitter bots, maybe it just doesn't rise the agenda [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2669.4s)]
*  Also, yeah, I mean certainly the Chinese know they could buy some of that DJT stock and yeah get curry Trump's career favorite Trump [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2672.6200000000003s)]
*  switching gears been staying in the Indo-Pacific though, of course the Washington Post had a [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2680.1400000000003s)]
*  amazing story about the attempted assassination of [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2685.46s)]
*  Sick activists living abroad by Indian intelligence services. So we covered a similar but unfortunately successful [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2688.94s)]
*  assassination of a Canadian man sick activists in June of last year [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2697.46s)]
*  But this new report in the Washington Post is about a plot to kill a man living in New York and the final instructions were relayed by [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2701.62s)]
*  intelligence operatives Indian intelligence operatives to the would-be assassin during Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's state visit to the US [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2709.86s)]
*  Think about that for a second during the state visit. They're like, yeah off this fucking guy [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2718.54s)]
*  Luckily US law enforcement and intelligence services prevented this from happening [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2722.98s)]
*  But the post says the plot by India's research and analysis wing or raw that's like the best [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2726.86s)]
*  Like WWE raw went all the way to the top that it was signed off by the head of raw [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2734.66s)]
*  And that Modi's national security adviser was probably aware of the general plan to take out these six separatists or activists all over the [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2740.1s)]
*  Planet the post piece notes that while six separatists were responsible for a lot of violent incidents back in the 80s including the [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2748.5s)]
*  assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2756.02s)]
*  The threat is now wildly overstated and overhyped by Modi probably for nationalist reasons [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2758.02s)]
*  Everyone should read the story because it's way too long to summarize here and it's great reporting but they also [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2764.38s)]
*  Mentioned that you know law enforcement has had to break up raw intelligence efforts in Australia [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2770.66s)]
*  Germany and the UK so they're doing this everywhere [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2776.18s)]
*  The post said the Biden ministrations response has basically been [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2778.7799999999997s)]
*  To get India to deal with the matter internally rather than make it [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2782.2599999999998s)]
*  You know public with expulsions or sanctions or other penalties they sent bill burns over there to deliver the like stern [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2785.5s)]
*  We know what you did clean up your shit message [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2791.2599999999998s)]
*  Ben I know going hard at India right now is complicated geopolitics for all the reasons we just talked about about China, but [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2794.5s)]
*  There's no doubt that if the Saudis did this [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2802.1s)]
*  People would be calling for the US to sever relations basically or the Chinese did it you know I mean I think that [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2805.16s)]
*  It you look Modi seems to have internalized what you just said that oh because of geopolitics [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2812.6s)]
*  I can basically do whatever the hell I want and the fact that he you know this is happening during a state visit [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2817.08s)]
*  Is the only state ultimate indicator that they feel like they can do whatever they want and there's no consequences I? [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2822.6s)]
*  Do think it's not unlike what we're just thinking about China like one starting point actually is to just be is just to blow the [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2829.8s)]
*  whistle on this publicly and and put it out there you know like like you know [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2835.84s)]
*  this should be embarrassing that they do this and [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2840.6400000000003s)]
*  they [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2844.28s)]
*  They didn't like it when I think this is something good Trudeau did when he blew the whistle on they flip what they did [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2845.4s)]
*  They flipped out the fact that they flipped out tells you that they don't want it to be known that they're doing this and so [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2850.84s)]
*  One step that is short of you know moving to sanctions or things like this is just being like hey wait a second [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2857.44s)]
*  We're gonna expose this because cut it out. You know as kind of a tactic of dissuading you from doing it [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2863.56s)]
*  Because the worst thing you want is for them to think they can just start killing people with impunity and like New York and [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2871.36s)]
*  I mean that we can't tolerate that and and whatever has allowed them to feel that impunity is not okay [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2877.0s)]
*  No, it's not okay. You don't think they got a raw deal in Canada [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2882.2999999999997s)]
*  I mean [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2885.84s)]
*  I'm sorry [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2887.7200000000003s)]
*  Well they got kind of cooked [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2890.84s)]
*  Okay, let's turn to Iran [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2893.2000000000003s)]
*  Okay, so listeners probably remember back in 2022 [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2895.04s)]
*  There was a huge wave of protests all across Iran in response to the murder of a young woman named Masa Amini [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2897.76s)]
*  By Iran's so-called morality police. She was arrested for improperly wearing her head scarf the hijab [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2903.32s)]
*  I'm sure she was properly wearing it and these assholes just picked her up [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2910.2000000000003s)]
*  Then they killed her at the time an Iranian rapper named to modestly released music critical of the Iranian regime in support of the protesters [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2913.1600000000003s)]
*  He was then arrested in late 2022 and sentenced to over six years in prison for some reason [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2920.8s)]
*  Sleazy was briefly [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2927.28s)]
*  I'm gonna say he for some reason he was briefly released and then re-arrested after publicly saying he'd been tortured in place in solitary confinement for [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2929.0s)]
*  252 days [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2936.44s)]
*  So CNN has a great write-up about all of this if you want to learn more [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2937.6400000000003s)]
*  Fast forward to last week so Leahy's lawyer announced the shocking news that his client had been sentenced to death [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2941.2s)]
*  For his participation in these protests participation, I guess meaning releasing a music video [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2947.3199999999997s)]
*  Another Kurdish Iranian rapper was also arrested during the protest movement and given a five-year sentence [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2954.16s)]
*  So officials in the US and Europe have denounced these sentences [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2959.56s)]
*  Artists and officials in the recording industry have been speaking out as well [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2963.3999999999996s)]
*  There have been protests in a lot of places all over the globe [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2967.2s)]
*  But Ben, I just think it's a reminder of I think the brutality of the Iranian regime [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2969.84s)]
*  But also how weak they ultimately are if they think that killing a rapper for releasing a song about a protest movement is [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2974.12s)]
*  The way to go forward. I mean doesn't speak to you know a country that feels confident in its decision-making [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2981.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and they stick to the crackdown, you know [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2988.08s)]
*  For you. I mean part of what this shows is that they're still [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2991.84s)]
*  Trying to squeeze and squeeze around the different elements of Iranian society that kind of join that movement and so, you know, there's a [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=2995.52s)]
*  the Iranian cultural sector [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3003.92s)]
*  They're trying to send a message any other musician in the future that might want to think about doing something like this [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3006.16s)]
*  And that's what's so important about this. I do think to your point [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3010.24s)]
*  You know this illustrates that like the real vulnerability is [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3014.56s)]
*  There how they treat their people [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3019.08s)]
*  And I say that because the Iranians probably like nothing more than this to be a debate about like the recent foreign policy issues in the region [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3022.04s)]
*  Right. Yeah, like how tough they are in Israel. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. It's [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3029.2799999999997s)]
*  if your objective is [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3032.88s)]
*  Illuminating challenging confronting the fundamental nature of the Iranian regime. I do think the most effective [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3036.92s)]
*  You know directional challenge to that is is around how they treat people how they treat women how they treat [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3044.36s)]
*  people exercising speech and and and and and in a weird way not letting them make this a debate about whether they're standing up to [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3050.2599999999998s)]
*  America, you know or Israel or whatever [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3058.62s)]
*  You know because sometimes [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3062.3399999999997s)]
*  like the people that claim to be supporting human rights in Iran are are mainly focused on foreign policy issues like [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3064.2599999999998s)]
*  What was so powerful about that movement is it was about? [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3070.42s)]
*  The regime its true character and how it treats its people and that's especially where people can continue to focus especially women [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3073.1s)]
*  Yeah, two more quick things [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3079.62s)]
*  So in Scotland humza Yusuf has resigned as the Scottish National Party leader in Scotland's first minister [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3081.62s)]
*  His tenure lasted less than a year and ended unexpectedly after tearing up an agreement with the Green Party in a battle with the party's [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3087.9s)]
*  lawmakers over climate change policy and differences and and how they what they wanted to set in terms of the targets going forward [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3094.2999999999997s)]
*  so [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3100.7799999999997s)]
*  The S&P set one of the most ambitious climate targets in the world [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3102.2599999999998s)]
*  They wanted to cut carbon emissions 75% by 2030 from 1990 levels [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3106.18s)]
*  But Yusuf said last month that the goals were set before he came into office and were beyond what we were able to achieve [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3111.34s)]
*  The Green Party then held a vote of no confidence a move [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3117.82s)]
*  He did not see Yusuf did not see coming in one he addressed in his resignation speech, which we have a clip from [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3120.78s)]
*  Unfortunately in ending the Butte House agreement in the manner that I did [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3126.62s)]
*  I clearly underestimated the level of hurt and upset that caused Green colleagues [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3131.38s)]
*  for a minority government to be able to govern effectively and efficiently [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3137.9s)]
*  Trust when working with the opposition is clearly fundamental [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3143.5s)]
*  And while a route through this week's motion of no confidence was absolutely possible [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3147.94s)]
*  I am not willing to trade my values and principles [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3153.86s)]
*  Order deals with whomever simply for retaining power [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3159.58s)]
*  There for after spending the weekend reflecting on what is best for my party for the government [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3164.66s)]
*  And for the country I lead I've concluded that repairing our relationship [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3171.34s)]
*  Across the political divide can only be done with someone else at the helm. I [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3176.54s)]
*  Have therefore informed the SMP's national secretary of my intention to stand down as party leader and [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3182.3799999999997s)]
*  Asked that she commences a leadership contest for my replacement as soon as possible [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3189.3799999999997s)]
*  So, I don't know all the ins and outs of what happened here. I I thought Yusuf was pretty inspiring leader [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3194.22s)]
*  I mean the way he talked about family who had been trapped in Gaza was was moving [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3199.8999999999996s)]
*  He was the first non-white head of the Scottish government, but pretty shocking [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3204.02s)]
*  Development here, I mean it also interesting to see what this will mean [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3208.2599999999998s)]
*  In terms of the S&P support vis-a-vis labor in the upcoming elections. Yeah. Well if you listen to him there [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3212.46s)]
*  I mean that was a pretty principled statement of resignation, you know [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3218.8199999999997s)]
*  So he continues to kind of demonstrate a degree of self-awareness and eloquence [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3223.94s)]
*  It is missing in a lot of political life in the world that said [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3229.62s)]
*  The two thoughts I had her first I mean this the stars are just really aligning for labor, you know [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3233.26s)]
*  Like and I'm not saying that as someone, you know, if you listen to pockets, you know, we're partial to labor [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3240.2400000000002s)]
*  But I mean the Tories are complete shit show like Rishi Sunak can barely hold that thing together [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3244.78s)]
*  He's holding it together with dumb shit like this Rwanda deal what you talk about in your interview [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3250.6200000000003s)]
*  then [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3255.94s)]
*  In Scotland is somewhere where labor needs to win and made some losses to the S&P in recent years [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3257.0200000000004s)]
*  The S&P seems like it's a bit of a mess these days and this kind of will reinforce that [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3262.58s)]
*  So politically in terms of a UK general election at some point this year [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3268.16s)]
*  Like I it feels like this is yet another data point that suggests labor is gonna have a good [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3272.62s)]
*  Election the other thing which I don't claim to know enough about right? So I don't know but the S&P it's it's interesting [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3278.82s)]
*  it's it's both a [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3285.46s)]
*  Nationalist party right and you know, they supported Scottish independence in the past and it's kind of a progressive party [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3287.66s)]
*  you know and the admissions target which is [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3294.02s)]
*  pretty fucking ambitious emissions target kind of seems representative that and [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3296.54s)]
*  And they had some issues member around trans issues and it does feel like there's a and again [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3301.46s)]
*  I I don't I say this is a totally an outside of the the tension between [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3306.86s)]
*  Are you a nationalist party and [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3312.42s)]
*  Ideologically left-wing party like it does feel like there's a bit of an identity [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3314.54s)]
*  Issue that needs to be sorted out within Scotland [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3318.38s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point because they kind of keep getting into these strange controversies around pretty ideological issues that that are not just about [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3320.7000000000003s)]
*  You know Scottish [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3328.1s)]
*  Decision-making and autonomy. Yeah, that's a that's a good observation, but we'll see this plays out. Yeah. Okay last thing Ben [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3330.26s)]
*  So I think I found the Isaac Chautner of New Zealand. Oh, I've been looking for that. So Isaac Chautner [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3337.3s)]
*  He does these amazing Q&A's for the New Yorker amazing in part because he gets people to agree to talk to him [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3346.94s)]
*  He's clearly gonna humiliate who's the fucking war criminal that did all the coups in Latin America that he just got [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3352.34s)]
*  He just said Elliott Abrams. Thank you. Yeah, you just said Elliott Abrams agreed to do an interview [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3357.26s)]
*  That's Chautner and like just finds a way to logic trap them every time [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3361.7000000000003s)]
*  So the Isaac Chautner of New Zealand writes for a site called newsroom [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3364.92s)]
*  You can find it at newsroom.co.nz the literary editor of newsroom a guy named Steve Branius [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3370.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm sorry if I'm butchering your name [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3377.52s)]
*  Decided to interview another guy named Todd Stevenson Todd Stevenson is an MP in the New Zealand [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3379.52s)]
*  Conservative Act party and he was recently named the art spokesman for the party [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3385.6800000000003s)]
*  One might assume that means he has interest in or knowledge of the arts one would be wrong [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3391.36s)]
*  He doesn't know anything about it and he doesn't give a shit [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3397.76s)]
*  So Steve did this interview and I thought we could do a quick dramatic reading Ben's I just sent you a little [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3401.6800000000003s)]
*  Transcript here. So I'm gonna be Steve. Okay, the literary editor. I'm in bold. You're Todd [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3408.92s)]
*  You're the conservative art spokesman. Okay, and Ben is reading this site unseen everyone. I'm not gonna do the accent. Okay good [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3414.32s)]
*  What's your experience or knowledge of the arts? I'm going to say other than as a consumer very limited [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3421.32s)]
*  There's some parts of the art sector. I'm personally interested in but yeah, it's an area [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3426.88s)]
*  I'm wanting to learn more about and I'm slowly getting to know I'm conducting. So this is Steve again [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3431.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm conducting the interview in my hat as the literary editor of the book section at newsroom. So what about literature? [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3436.92s)]
*  What's your experience or knowledge there? Yeah, I'm gonna be pretty straight up with you, Steve [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3441.8s)]
*  I mainly read nonfiction to be honest, so it's been a while since I read a novel. What about New Zealand books? [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3447.1s)]
*  That's an area. I want to kind of learn a bit more about you're delivering the shit out of these side [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3454.2999999999997s)]
*  Are there any New Zealand authors you have read? It's been a long time to be honest Steve [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3460.1s)]
*  I'm just trying to think of the last one. I would have read can I come back to you on that? [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3465.06s)]
*  But you don't have individual taste yourself. Do you you're kind of an arts ignoramus really by your own reckoning? [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3469.86s)]
*  No, I certainly have individual things that I like to go to we talked about that earlier you've been to see Hamilton [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3475.92s)]
*  Well, I was just giving you an example of the things I like to do. What are your tastes other than musicals? [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3480.96s)]
*  That's the main one in the creative sector and I watch movies. I [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3486.32s)]
*  Watch TV. I watch TV says the art smoke the acts spokesman for the arts [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3491.32s)]
*  Creative things are on TV. Are they not Steve? That's my favorite line in this whole thing [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3496.6800000000003s)]
*  So there's really not more to ask you is there I mean you just don't know your subject [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3501.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, that's right [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3505.04s)]
*  I've absolutely no more questions for somebody who has absolutely no knowledge of their subject, but I appreciate your time [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3507.8s)]
*  Yeah, and as I said Steve I'm out there trying to learn more and as I go through the rest of the year [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3512.92s)]
*  I'm sure I will learn more my door is always open to talk to people [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3517.6s)]
*  That's one thing you'll find about me and all the portfolios I'm engaged in my door is always open to talk to stakeholders [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3521.0s)]
*  I think there would be very few people in the arts and literature who could be bothered opening the door to talk to you [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3527.12s)]
*  That's your opinion Steve as I said [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3532.96s)]
*  I've actually had some very fruitful engagements so far and I'm looking forward to continuing that and talking to more people in the year [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3535.36s)]
*  All right. Thanks for your time. Maybe I'll talk to you later in the year Steve. I don't see why bye. I [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3540.28s)]
*  Don't know that's our first and probably final dramatic reading [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3547.6400000000003s)]
*  I don't know who Steve Branius is but he's maybe my favorite interviewer ever. Well, I [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3550.44s)]
*  Don't know Todd is but I know that this right wing New Zealand party like came to [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3556.2400000000002s)]
*  Power like trashing just into Ardern with a lot of like disinformation and misinformation. So we don't like these people [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3562.96s)]
*  We're still just in the stands. This guy is such a clown the thing. It's actually much longer [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3569.6400000000003s)]
*  He's like what musicals have you seen? He's like I saw [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3574.48s)]
*  Hamilton a couple years ago. He doesn't read he only reads like nonfiction books about campaigns [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3577.44s)]
*  He couldn't think of a novel he couldn't think of the New Zealand author that he liked for a while [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3582.28s)]
*  They're not exactly building a chem what over there. No, it was not it was not great [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3586.76s)]
*  But okay, that's it for the news section of the show it for our dramatic readings when we come back [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3591.56s)]
*  You will hear my interview with John McDermott from The Economist about a lot of fascinating things happening in Africa [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3597.1s)]
*  talking about the South Africa elections of the 30th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide and how the US is getting pushed out of the [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3603.28s)]
*  South region while [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3609.72s)]
*  Russia and the Wagner mercenary group are moving in joining me now is John McDermott [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3611.24s)]
*  He's the African correspondent for The Economist and actually someone I've known for many years great to see you in [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3615.64s)]
*  Thanks for having me on how are you? I'm doing very well. We were just commiserating before we started recording about [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3620.88s)]
*  Life and all things children, but I will I'll get to the news because that's why people are here. So this month [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3626.84s)]
*  Marks two very different but momentous 30th anniversaries on the continent of Africa [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3632.96s)]
*  It'll be the 30th anniversary of the first democratic election in South Africa that officially ended apartheid and earlier this month [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3638.12s)]
*  Rwanda commemorated the 30th anniversary of the 1994 Rwandan genocide want to ask you about both of those [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3645.32s)]
*  Events and as well as some of the ways the US standing in influence in Africa seems to have diminished [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3652.48s)]
*  But let's start in South Africa because you're based there currently [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3658.8s)]
*  On May 29th South Africa will hold national elections [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3662.2400000000002s)]
*  The Africa National Congress or ANC which is the party of Nelson Mandela has been in power for all of that those 30 years [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3666.36s)]
*  But recent polls seem to show their support slipping a bit [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3673.48s)]
*  Our political analysts anticipating a major political shift and what do you think is driving? [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3678.2000000000003s)]
*  Voter sentiment at the moment. Yeah, the elections on May 29th are gonna be a big deal [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3684.4s)]
*  But I don't think they're gonna be the dramatic shift that many [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3691.48s)]
*  Were speculating a few months ago [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3696.96s)]
*  And back then there were some polls that were suggesting the ANC might be on kind of [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3699.88s)]
*  40% or upper 30s which for many political parties would be a fairly decent showing [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3708.2s)]
*  But given the ANC has never not had more than 50% of the votes. It would be it would have been a disaster [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3714.8399999999997s)]
*  Now I think most polls are showing [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3722.7999999999997s)]
*  The ANC closer to 45% which under the South African system of proportional representation which is a bit like Germany or Israel [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3725.4s)]
*  Will require them to get coalition, but that should be fairly doable. So I think the [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3732.88s)]
*  Consensus view at the moment is that they will scrape by battered and bruised [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3738.44s)]
*  but in some ways [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3743.6000000000004s)]
*  It's kind of astonishing that they've fallen so far. I mean in 2019 under President so Ramaphosa [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3745.6400000000003s)]
*  They got 57% of the votes. So this will be the biggest drop from one election to another and I think this gets to the other [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3752.56s)]
*  thing you were talking about which is the 30 years of democracy in South Africa, which in many ways if you're stepping right back [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3760.48s)]
*  has been something of a game of two halves, which is a bit like kind of my football as opposed to your football and [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3768.84s)]
*  And [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3775.52s)]
*  In the first half so kind of the 15 years from 1994 when Mdela came to power through the Thabo Mbeki years [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3777.12s)]
*  Life generally got better for almost every South African [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3784.92s)]
*  Growth was ticking along not spectacularly, but pretty good [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3788.72s)]
*  the ANC built up a basic welfare state and there was a general sense of catharsis after the [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3792.08s)]
*  Decades if not centuries of white supremacy [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3798.2s)]
*  But in the second half which coincided with Jacob Zuma, but some of the problems predated him [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3801.24s)]
*  things have been [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3807.64s)]
*  Pretty bad. I mean GDP per capita is essentially the same as it was in 2008 [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3809.36s)]
*  and unemployment has gone from kind of horrific to atrocious and [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3814.16s)]
*  That's had a big impact on how South Africans view the ruling party [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3818.48s)]
*  And that's why they will take a bit of a battering [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3822.72s)]
*  I've seen some statistics from the World Bank [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3824.92s)]
*  Which said that South Africa was the most unequal country in the world in terms of wealth distribution [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3827.2400000000002s)]
*  80% of the population is black and there is a 35 point gap between black and white unemployment [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3833.44s)]
*  What I mean is is the frustration you're seeing in the electric the electorate? [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3838.8s)]
*  Kind of because of though that glaring inequality and the continued racial divide despite [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3843.28s)]
*  You know apartheid ending 30 years ago 30 years after the end of apartheid South Africa remains [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3848.76s)]
*  deeply deeply unequal and [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3854.0s)]
*  To some extent [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3858.12s)]
*  what has happened over the past 30 years has been that a [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3860.2400000000002s)]
*  minority of [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3865.2400000000002s)]
*  The black majority has been able to enter [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3866.64s)]
*  The middle class and to a lesser extent the top stratum of society [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3870.36s)]
*  But the majority has still been left [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3875.64s)]
*  Outside of that progress and interestingly in South Africa [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3881.04s)]
*  There's a big debate as to why that is and for some people there's something of an original sin that happened back in 1994 [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3884.68s)]
*  Occasionally you hear this notion that Nelson Mandela sold us out and I think what people mean by that is [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3892.64s)]
*  He won us political freedom, but not necessarily economic freedom now. I happen to think that's [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3899.48s)]

*  Of course, you can't right but it's also because of deliberate decisions that ANC has made [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=3926.12s)]

*  Somewhat dubious, but it's [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4046.1s)]
*  True. Nevertheless that that's what it's doing [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4048.74s)]
*  so I think the United States has [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4051.54s)]
*  recognized that and [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4054.9399999999996s)]
*  Also understands that South Africa for a combination of historical reasons and self-interest will always want to be non-aligned [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4056.7799999999997s)]
*  I think what the United States is trying to do isn't ensure that it's a genuine policy of non-alignment [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4063.62s)]
*  As opposed to one that is rhetorically non-aligned but is actually helping [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4069.8999999999996s)]
*  enemies or [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4075.2999999999997s)]
*  adversaries of the United States and I think that's where some of the actions vis-a-vis Russia [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4076.68s)]
*  Crossed the line in the eyes of the United States both with this [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4082.66s)]
*  Slightly odd issue of the weapons that may or may not have gone onto a ship near Cape Town [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4086.58s)]
*  But also for instance having military exercises with Russia and China on the same week that Ukraine was [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4091.3399999999997s)]
*  commemorating a year of the the invasion by Russia [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4099.139999999999s)]
*  So but but I think things have taken a bit of a bit of a course correction and [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4101.58s)]
*  both the United States and the EU seems to kind of be [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4106.9s)]
*  Plodding along trying to make the best of it. That's good. A course correction seemed needed [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4111.46s)]
*  Moving north the US military just got pushed out of Niger [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4116.98s)]
*  Chad is reportedly threatening to kick out US troops over the past several years [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4121.54s)]
*  There's been this wave of coups in the Sahel region of Africa and one consistent feature of them seems to be that an outcome is [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4125.74s)]
*  That Western countries like the US and the French get pushed out or lose influence generally while Russia or the Wagner group the Wagner mercenary group [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4133.54s)]
*  They gain influence. What is your sense of? [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4142.54s)]
*  Why this is happening and what it says about shifting power dynamics in the Sahel region [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4145.66s)]
*  I think there's a couple of things going on one is security and the other is sovereignty [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4149.8s)]
*  So take security first [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4155.02s)]
*  This is one of the most conflict riddled parts of the world before Gaza [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4157.900000000001s)]
*  Nearly 50% of all conflict related deaths were in the Sahel and that's excluding Sudan, which I know you've talked about on the show before [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4163.18s)]
*  so there was always a [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4171.900000000001s)]
*  potential for [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4175.06s)]
*  Governments to come to power who could claim however rightly to do a better job of providing security than the previous guys [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4176.9400000000005s)]
*  the other the other aspect and I think this is often lost in the kind of Western talk of [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4184.38s)]
*  These countries as part of some geopolitical game is is sovereignty and if you actually listen to any of these [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4191.26s)]
*  millennial [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4197.18s)]
*  Military men that are now making up a lot of the hunters in the region [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4198.5s)]
*  They talk about this all the time, right when the coups happen [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4201.86s)]
*  They tend to be more popular than many people assume I mean [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4207.82s)]
*  Sometimes the guys on the streets waving Russian flags of plants, but sometimes it is a kind of genuine genuine outpouring of support [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4211.84s)]
*  and [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4219.24s)]
*  when the [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4220.28s)]
*  Russians have come in in various guises [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4222.2s)]
*  What are they doing? [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4225.12s)]
*  they are [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4226.92s)]
*  Providing security for the regime and crucially they're fighting the guys that the regime wants to fight and often there was the perception that the [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4229.639999999999s)]
*  French or the Americans were fighting the guys that Paris or Washington wanted to fight [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4237.4s)]
*  No, they're also [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4242.799999999999s)]
*  the Russians [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4245.36s)]
*  Far more willing to commit heinous human rights abuses than Western bank forces ever were but [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4247.28s)]
*  for the [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4254.639999999999s)]
*  To get some of the mindset of the people that are now running these countries [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4256.48s)]
*  What matters is that they have partners that are doing exactly what they want now? [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4259.74s)]
*  I happen to think all this will end in tears, but there is a certain grim logic to what they're trying to do [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4264.6s)]
*  No, that's a that's a really good point. I mean the US policy was overtly to go after [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4269.400000000001s)]
*  Jihadi groups that had designs on attacking the US homeland [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4274.76s)]
*  So of course, you know that doesn't feel like it's in the interest of the host country [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4278.72s)]
*  You mentioned Sudan we have talked a lot about the Civil War in Sudan in particular [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4282.240000000001s)]
*  How the United Arab Emirates is feeding that conflict by sending weapons to one of the two warring parties the RSF this paramilitary group? [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4287.160000000001s)]
*  On Monday the US ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas Greenfield warned that quote [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4294.84s)]
*  History is repeating itself in Darfur in the worst possible way [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4299.700000000001s)]
*  And she said that a major city in Darfur was quote on the precipice of a large-scale massacre [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4303.160000000001s)]
*  She also specifically called out the UAE as did UN sanctions monitors who said it's credible that UAE is funneling arms into Sudan [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4308.52s)]
*  We should note that the UAE denies providing assistance to any armed group in Sudan [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4316.320000000001s)]
*  Why do you think the UAE is getting involved in Sudan and I know you've been watching how they've been investing in Africa more broadly [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4320.86s)]
*  What have you seen? I think it's fascinating what the UAE is doing across the continent [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4327.38s)]
*  And it's part of a broader trend where not just China not just Russia [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4333.06s)]
*  But these kind of more assertive middle powers are becoming more influential in in many African countries [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4337.7s)]
*  And I think you have to almost divide the continent in two from the perspective of Abu Dhabi [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4345.139999999999s)]
*  There's the Horn of Africa stretching into the Sahel [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4351.46s)]
*  So the Horn of Africa is kind of Ethiopia Sudan Somalia the northeast corner and that's very much [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4355.66s)]
*  The neighborhood as perceived by Abu Dhabi and what it appears to be doing is establishing a series of client leaders [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4362.78s)]
*  Abiy Ahmed the Prime Minister of Ethiopia is probably the most powerful of those but then also there's the [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4371.94s)]
*  warlord that is fighting the traditional Sudanese army kind of General Khamenei and [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4378.9s)]
*  I don't know if UAE itself knows what the ultimate objective is apart from having [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4383.9s)]
*  people [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4390.54s)]
*  who can [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4391.62s)]
*  be their clients in a region which it sees as kind of increasingly important and [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4393.46s)]
*  Going back to the Sahel for a second, I mean the Sahel kind of bleeds into [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4398.860000000001s)]
*  Sudan through through Chad [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4403.06s)]
*  There's an election in in Chad next week and the UAE has been [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4406.3s)]
*  With with the with the French and the US they've been kind of backing [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4413.62s)]
*  the the strongman there so [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4418.3s)]
*  it's it's interesting that in some cases you find the [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4421.06s)]
*  UE on the side of the United States and the West in Africa and then some cases you find them on the opposite and I think [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4425.780000000001s)]
*  That and the fact that Africa is often on the bottom of the agenda when Jake Sullivan or Anthony Blinken or whoever is meeting with [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4433.46s)]
*  Emirati leaders is why it's been quite complicated for [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4440.34s)]
*  United States to go hard on the UAE for its alleged role in in Sudan. I mean, I think that's that's weakened [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4444.740000000001s)]
*  Cowardly in many ways, but but there is kind of other things going on. Yeah, so if you have the horn on one side [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4451.74s)]
*  then there's the kind of the rest of sub-saharan Africa where [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4458.139999999999s)]
*  the UE is [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4462.339999999999s)]
*  Becoming a bit more like a new China. So if it's acting a bit more like Russia in the horn [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4465.139999999999s)]
*  picking up client states funneling arms and so on in [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4470.339999999999s)]
*  Relatively [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4476.0599999999995s)]
*  stable countries like [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4477.46s)]
*  Like Zambia it is becoming an increasingly important source of [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4479.34s)]
*  Capital as in some places China becomes less important [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4484.26s)]
*  so in mining for instance the UE in addition to the Saudis are [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4489.18s)]
*  becoming the go-to place for investment outside the traditional major mining companies and [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4494.14s)]
*  I you know from the African perspective [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4500.9400000000005s)]
*  What the UAE offers is a bit like what China? [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4504.54s)]
*  Has offered for a long time it offers money no strings attached and speed right? Yeah, I think you really can't [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4507.74s)]
*  Overstate that speed point compared to you know, US processes and Congress and funding cycles and you know oversight, etc [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4515.86s)]
*  Etc. I'm sure we're a nightmare to work with as compared to someone like the UAE [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4523.379999999999s)]
*  The last country I want to ask you about is I mean we at the top [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4528.66s)]
*  I mentioned how this month marked the 30th anniversary of the start of the wandon genocide [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4531.82s)]
*  For those who don't know that was when our militias from the Hutu ethnic group [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4536.9400000000005s)]
*  Massacred hundreds of thousands of members of the Tutsi ethnic minority group along with many moderate Hutus [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4541.780000000001s)]
*  I know you are recently in Rwanda. What did you make of that visit? [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4547.62s)]
*  and how a country can recover from an event that horrific prevent it from happening again and also maybe you know use [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4552.700000000001s)]
*  the legacy or prevention of [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4560.900000000001s)]
*  Another genocide for political purposes if you're a political leader it has always fascinated me that [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4563.740000000001s)]
*  You have in Rwanda this incredibly population dense place so many [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4571.54s)]
*  perpetrators and [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4576.9400000000005s)]
*  Kind of victims families living side by side and I think under those circumstances [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4578.46s)]
*  How could you not if you are? [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4585.06s)]
*  the Rwandan government [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4588.02s)]
*  have a very kind of [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4590.700000000001s)]
*  assertive let's just say approach to reconciliation and reeducation mm-hmm and [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4593.0599999999995s)]
*  You know to some extent it has worked right there's not been another genocide and [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4599.9s)]
*  You know anecdotally people kind of rub along and they complain about the bossy bureaucrats [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4605.26s)]
*  But I do think there's been kind of like a massive massive overreach which has less to do with [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4610.66s)]
*  Preventing another genocide and more to do with perpetuating [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4618.78s)]
*  All Kagami's stay in power [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4622.78s)]
*  I mean this is the guy that kind of rescued Rwanda from the genocide and there's a [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4625.0599999999995s)]
*  Whole series of wormholes down which you can go if you want to learn about what happened [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4630.259999999999s)]
*  During the genocide before the genocide after the genocide causing all the Congo Wars and so on [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4636.179999999999s)]
*  But there's no doubt that [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4641.419999999999s)]
*  Rwanda in addition to being [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4644.339999999999s)]
*  Kind of this clean and efficient place nowadays also has a very kind of sinister edge because in the name of the genocide [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4646.58s)]
*  There's also been huge curtailment of free speech going after dissidents [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4654.18s)]
*  Commentators youtubers etc. So you know there's going to be elections in Rwanda on [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4660.22s)]
*  July 15th, and I think the only question is whether the army is going to win by 98 or 99 percent of the vote [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4666.14s)]
*  Yes, nice North Korea numbers. Yeah [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4671.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, nice nice North Korean numbers, but just just a kind of one final thought Rwanda which is [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4674.0199999999995s)]
*  You know in the [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4682.66s)]
*  In the you know, maybe the 21st 20 years after the genocide [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4684.459999999999s)]
*  I think a combination of a sense in the West that rightly they didn't do enough to slow or overt the genocide [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4688.62s)]
*  Plus the fact that it was actually a African country that was spending aid money well [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4697.139999999999s)]
*  meant that [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4702.6s)]
*  People in Washington Paris London forgave a lot of the sins now, I think that [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4704.68s)]
*  Western policymakers have largely kind of wised up to the truth about the Kagame regime [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4710.72s)]
*  But what he's done and this reflects a kind of change that's happening across the continent [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4717.16s)]
*  is that he's worked out that geopolitics is changing and that the [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4722.12s)]
*  influence of the West isn't what it was and that you can [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4726.84s)]
*  You can have kind of these different partners so he has a close relationship with China with Turkey with Qatar actually as well [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4730.46s)]
*  and at the same time [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4737.18s)]
*  he [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4739.66s)]
*  He's varied very transactional [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4740.9s)]
*  So he's kind of helping the French or helping the EU out with fighting jihadists in northern Mozambique. He's doing this kind of [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4742.9s)]
*  you know morally horrific asylum seeker deal with the British and [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4751.26s)]
*  And with the Americans I mean he's still a kind of [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4755.74s)]
*  Seen as something of a steady security partner and going back to the Sahel [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4759.46s)]
*  It wouldn't surprise me if you see some more kind of Rwandan pilots there there one day [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4763.74s)]
*  So, I think he's he's gone from being a bit of a donor darling to being a kind of African master of real polity [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4770.58s)]
*  Interesting. Yeah, um final question for you and I want to ask you about that [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4775.26s)]
*  That sinister edge you described in Rwanda in this asylum deal [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4780.0599999999995s)]
*  So the UK is planning to start deporting asylum seekers who arrived via irregular means usually it's yeah [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4783.74s)]
*  You know a small boat from France. I saw this week [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4790.74s)]
*  I think a top minister top Tory ministers said they expect to deport 6,000 migrants to Rwanda this year [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4794.0199999999995s)]
*  These are people who almost certainly have no connection to Rwanda. They have no family there [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4800.5s)]
*  They have no time reason people from Afghanistan from Syria from all over the place [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4805.9s)]
*  The plan has been controversial to say the least [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4809.42s)]
*  Britain's Supreme Court found Rwanda to be unsafe for refugees [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4812.06s)]
*  So British lawmakers passed a bill that sent essentially said actually it is safe and that's how they resolve the problem here [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4815.5s)]
*  What is your sense of the security climate for? [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4821.7s)]
*  Migrants who may start to begin arriving from the UK [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4826.06s)]
*  Sometime this year and and what do people in Rwanda make of this deal that their government has cut with the UK? [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4830.38s)]
*  I'm tempted to conclude cynically that there's so much attention on the deal that [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4836.22s)]
*  Rwanda has a huge interest in making sure that [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4842.66s)]
*  These asylum seekers are not [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4846.7s)]
*  Mistreated. Mm-hmm. I mean, it's almost impossible to find out what ordinary [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4850.06s)]
*  Rwandans think because of the fear that they have about speaking to the people [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4855.3s)]
*  The fear that they have about speaking truthfully [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4862.139999999999s)]
*  What was quite interesting though is amongst the Rwandan elite [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4867.459999999999s)]
*  There was almost a sense of kind of buyer's remorse about the deal [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4871.54s)]
*  Oh, yeah, you know Rwanda I'm not sure how much this this gets across in in the US, but they're obviously [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4875.099999999999s)]
*  putting a lot of effort into [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4881.139999999999s)]
*  Branding themselves in a new way. So they sponsor Arsenal Football Club. They sponsor Paris Saint-Germain [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4883.179999999999s)]
*  there's lots of [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4888.219999999999s)]
*  Kind of paid advertising in [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4890.34s)]
*  Magazines like oh, yeah, I see Geo and stuff like that come see the gorillas. It's all fun [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4892.860000000001s)]
*  You know Ellen comes and all that all that stuff. So there's a sense in which maybe [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4897.900000000001s)]
*  they want to kind of portray themselves as a as a kind of [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4902.14s)]
*  luxurious product in a way and [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4907.740000000001s)]
*  Having a lot of heat for being a [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4912.18s)]
*  repressive dictatorship that [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4916.26s)]
*  Abuses human rights and will mistreat asylum seekers isn't exactly good for the brand [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4919.26s)]
*  So while I think Kagami is in too deep with it [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4925.1s)]
*  They're certainly to the extent that you ever get any dissent in Rwanda some murmurings that this may have been a bit of a mistake [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4927.52s)]
*  And they underestimated the potential heat they were gonna get [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMoL8bK2l0E&t=4934.18s)]
