*  But yeah, well, I'm with you. That's join you in the Yankee hatred, but like Phillies really grown [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=14.700000000000001s)]

*  They seem like they need to like chill out a little bit. They're very sensitive, but then they throw batteries at like Santa Claus [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=27.98s)]
*  every single Eagles fan [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=33.86s)]
*  Seems to be like Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=35.900000000000006s)]
*  Just like a little psychotic, you know, like you might say the wrong thing and they just go ballistic. It's like, okay guys [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=39.58s)]
*  It's just a football game, you know, just a football game. Yeah [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=44.38s)]
*  That they win and we lose but anyway Ben, it's been quite a couple weeks here [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=47.82s)]
*  Potts in a journey headquarters [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=53.22s)]
*  Yes, we're learning a lot about what Trump 2.0 is foreign policy is gonna look like so we're gonna spend a lot of time on that [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=55.260000000000005s)]
*  Today we're gonna talk about the State Department freezing all foreign aid [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=62.22s)]
*  Domestic spending too, by the way, but that's not our piece of this thing. We'll talk about the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=65.98s)]
*  Firing of all the non-political leadership at USAID some major changes at the Pentagon within the US military [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=70.86s)]
*  Trump just beating the shit out of the president of Colombia and the Prime Minister of Denmark for fun [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=78.06s)]
*  I think I'm sort of exhausted already by that and then we're gonna cover this growing war in the Democratic Republic of Congo a [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=82.94s)]
*  huge step forward in AI [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=89.7s)]
*  That is spooked Silicon Valley Wall Street and some people in government and then some updates on Syria and why we love the French [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=92.18s)]
*  And then you'll hear my interview with Peter Barnard about his new book being Jewish after the destruction of Gaza [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=99.42s)]
*  Which we both got a PDF of yeah, I've started reading it and it is incredibly powerful and [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=103.94s)]
*  Fearless, you know Peter does not there's no self censorship. No, it does not mince words [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=110.14s)]
*  it's deeply informed deeply personal definitely worth checking out that's why I [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=115.25999999999999s)]
*  like talking to him so much and I so much respect for him is that [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=120.3s)]
*  He has taken some views early on his career like supporting the Iraq War that he is completely [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=124.38s)]
*  Apologized for and and course corrected in a very public and thoughtful way and then on all things or Israel Palestine [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=131.18s)]
*  He's taken views that you're not allowed to say in official Washington [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=139.58s)]
*  Yeah, right that have cost him professionally and personally in the form of relationships and friendships [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=145.14000000000001s)]
*  You're financially financially I'm sure and he just doesn't care [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=150.26s)]
*  He just has this like moral compass where he feels obligated to say what he thinks about this stuff [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=153.54s)]
*  Yeah, which is very rare in American public life very rare in American foreign policy [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=157.92s)]
*  I mean because right if you want to keep getting booked on I don't know [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=162.64s)]
*  Insert name of yeah talk show. Yeah, you usually don't get to have these views [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=165.48s)]
*  You don't see Peter a lot on cable news [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=170.16s)]
*  No, and I'm sure you know book events of his will be canceled and people will protest them and things [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=171.64s)]
*  But it's a guy speaking the truth as he knows it so very impressive. So [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=176.28s)]
*  alright [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=180.8s)]
*  well [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=181.28s)]
*  let's get to this Trump piece of our conversation then because a lot of big things have happening kind of rattled off a few the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=181.44s)]
*  You know in terms of our like mantra of watch what he does not what he says [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=187.48000000000002s)]
*  The cutting off all foreign aid or freezing all foreign aid, although I think we should assume it's cut. Yeah until further notice [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=191.72s)]
*  That is a huge deal [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=198.44s)]
*  So Trump signed an executive order on his first day of his administration putting a 90-day pause on all foreign assistance programs [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=199.60000000000002s)]
*  People weren't sure if that meant just new stuff or whether it would stop ongoing things like existing programming [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=205.88s)]
*  last week [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=213.52s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio first time I said that out loud [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=215.08s)]
*  Clarified to all the agencies that this pause applies to even programs where money had already been awarded [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=218.76000000000002s)]
*  So in practice what that means is programs that clear landmines and unexploded ordinance were forced to stop working [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=224.08s)]
*  That means people in Vietnam Iraq Ukraine are now at risk of you know, picking up a cluster munition [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=231.60000000000002s)]
*  I'm blown off Laos. Yeah [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=237.20000000000002s)]
*  And the New York Times pointed out that this puts Americans at risk too because unexploded ordinance killed as many [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=239.6s)]
*  US military ground troops during the 1991 Persian Gulf War as were lost to enemy fire [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=245.88s)]
*  It means PEPFAR a wildly successful program to combat HIV and AIDS around the world the one created by George Bush [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=251.23999999999998s)]
*  It's credited with saving 25 million lives has been frozen [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=258.32s)]
*  There's reports that you have staff on the ground in clinics who are told not to give out medicines that are like sitting on the shelf [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  Over there that are purchased and distributed to these clinics, but they just can't use them [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=268.12s)]
*  There's foreign military financing that goes through the State Department for countries like Taiwan and Ukraine. That's now frozen [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=272.36s)]
*  They have stopped work on battling a breakout of an Ebola like virus in Tanzania [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=279.16s)]
*  They've stopped monitoring of the bird flu in 49 countries [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=284.72s)]
*  No way that's ever gonna come back to bite us and then you know just to make sure that like these forints [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=288.36s)]
*  I've got the price of eggs [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=293.16s)]
*  Just to make sure that like, you know foreign assistance programs were fully kneecapped [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=296.04s)]
*  the new political leaders at USAID [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=300.56s)]
*  Put about 60 of the agency's top career staff on leave meaning that like all the senior [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=303.08000000000004s)]
*  career non-political professional staff are just not the office anymore probably hundreds of years of knowledge [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=310.6s)]
*  Yeah, there's the equivalent of firing all the generals in the military basically [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=316.36s)]
*  So Ben in the first term like I think this was the kind of thing you might see the Trump people do [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=321.1s)]
*  Because they didn't understand the implications. My fear now is [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=328.02000000000004s)]
*  That they know how damaging is this is they want us to freak out and that's kind of what this is about [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=332.94s)]
*  Like they want the fight, you know, because again, it's like a status quo versus change, but I'm wondering how [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=339.62s)]
*  Like what you made of some of these moves and what you thought the most impactful ones were [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=345.98s)]
*  Well, first of all, you know Rubio we scum general ruby general sector review [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=349.94s)]
*  You know, he keeps repeating this mantra that we're only gonna fund programs that are directly serve US interests [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=354.38s)]
*  We already know that Trump's view of US interest or Trump's interest and actually there's a tell and the fact that the only carve-out [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=360.26s)]
*  Was for Israel essentially Israeli assistance and Egypt's yeah Egypt, but that's for Israel. Yeah, it's for the peace treaty Camp David accords [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=367.46s)]
*  And so you have to think that this isn't a freeze where they're gonna resume at the same level [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=375.08s)]
*  this is a freeze with the intention to massively cut a whole range of programs and we can guess what it's all the kinds of [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=379.96s)]
*  things you talked about and [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=386.2s)]
*  Think there's a few different [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=388.08s)]
*  Angles that people should be concerned about the first are there really is foreign assistance that is directly in the national security space, right? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=390.03999999999996s)]
*  so if there are prison camps in [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=397.71999999999997s)]
*  Eastern Syria where Isis members are you know, there's US assistance that pays [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=401.8s)]
*  The local employed guards at the prison camps, you know [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=407.76s)]
*  There's assistance that is directly tied to kind of counter terrorism missions. Did you see the reporting on this? Yes [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=410.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, that some of the guards just didn't show up to work because they thought their their salaries were cut off [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=415.56s)]
*  Yeah, so these Isis guys like 10,000 Isis guys almost just walked out of the person [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=420.08000000000004s)]
*  You don't want that to happen seems that that would be bad, right and similar a pandemic or an epidemic, you know, we fought [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=423.56s)]
*  the Ebola outbreak which Americans freaked out about that Trump fear-mongered about [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=429.32s)]
*  That was largely fought through foreign assistance or USAID setting up public health facilities in Africa to stop the Ebola outbreak [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=433.84s)]
*  There so it couldn't get here and that worked [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=441.35999999999996s)]
*  So when you're talking about things like health and counterterrorism, these are things that directly affect American lives [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=443.59999999999997s)]
*  You don't have to make it a bank shot, right? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=448.91999999999996s)]
*  Then there are things that let's be clear this stuff that Trump does [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=450.91999999999996s)]
*  It seems like a show if these spending cuts stay in place [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=454.79999999999995s)]
*  If these spending cuts stay in place people will die because of them, you know [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=457.48s)]
*  Whether that's people that are not getting HIV AIDS drugs under PEPFAR whether that's you know kids [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=461.6s)]
*  Who are picking up unexploded ordinance in Laos that could have been cleared and they the unexploded ordinance blows up [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=467.64s)]
*  You might not care about that, but then you're a shitty person and I don't care about you [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=473.52s)]
*  You know, I mean this is something that I'm gonna take to the Trump years is it well, you know [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=477.98s)]
*  You care about PEPFAR like that. You should fuck. It's a Republican program to by the way [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=481.56s)]
*  It's George W Bush's greatest legacy or by far only good legacy, right? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=485.9s)]
*  And so there will be real-world consequences life-and-death consequences for people [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=489.56s)]
*  Because these programs are cut and if you don't like the United States doing anything as the world's most powerful country for humanitarian purpose around [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=494.78s)]
*  The world. Okay. Congratulations. Like I'm glad you know, you're gonna feel good that kids are dying that that's pretty fucked up [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=502.06s)]
*  Yeah [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=509.17999999999995s)]
*  well [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=509.46s)]
*  Hack a member of Congress for a second like the the they're clearing ordinance from fields in Ukraine that grow things like wheat like yeah [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=510.18s)]
*  Parts of Ukraine are the breadbasket of the world if those fields are unusable for very long periods of time [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=517.7s)]
*  Guess what's gonna grow up? Yeah the cost of wheat the cost of bread, right? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=522.58s)]
*  So there is could be a direct impact. Although it's circuitous in long term [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=525.6s)]
*  Yeah, and and the last thing I'd say is that there and there's so many things we could say about this [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=529.2s)]
*  But you often hear people like us talk about well, this is a gift to China [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=534.6800000000001s)]
*  You know, I want to be specific about this right and Rubio is the kind of person who says we're in this big [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=538.7s)]
*  geopolitical competition with China you go to Africa [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=543.82s)]
*  I remember going to Ethiopia where the African Union is like the kind of UN of Africa. It's in a building that China built [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=546.5600000000001s)]
*  China is building shit all over the world. They're building ports in Latin America [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=554.38s)]
*  They're building government buildings in infrastructure in Africa [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=558.7800000000001s)]
*  They're you know building technology ecosystems in Southeast Asia if the United States withdraws from all of the contributions these international [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=562.62s)]
*  Institutions all of these development programs in these parts of the world. We by definition will have far less influence [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=571.66s)]
*  I mean you just you don't need to be some national security expert to understand that if suddenly we're not even in the game and [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=577.74s)]
*  You've got China and Russia and other countries that go down to these places and spread some money around [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=584.78s)]
*  They're good they're by definition gonna have a ton of more influence you couple that with things like, you know [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=589.08s)]
*  Terror threats it just is gonna turbocharge the reorientation of the world towards China [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=594.8000000000001s)]
*  They have Belt Road initiative [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=601.4s)]
*  They have these development initiatives that other countries want to be a part of and if the US is not offering anything as an alternative [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=603.0s)]
*  Clearly we are going to lose whatever geopolitical competition Marco Rubio likes to talk about us being in with China [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=611.1600000000001s)]
*  Well, we are threatening to annex some of their countries. Yeah, so there's that yeah, you know, you're totally right [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=616.74s)]
*  And Trump's also I mean we can see them getting their sea legs Trump's getting his team into place [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=622.26s)]
*  Secretary-general Rubio was now at state. Hegseth was confirmed at the Pentagon John Ratcliffe is the new CIA director [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=626.88s)]
*  So like slowly the pieces are coming into place [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=633.16s)]
*  We just talked about how all these senior career USAID staffers got put on leave a similar thing happened at the White House to the National [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=635.54s)]
*  Security Council staffers they got sent home until you know future notice [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=643.38s)]
*  Presumably until they can be vetted for ideological reasons and then over the Pentagon the Department of Defense will once again [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=648.78s)]
*  Ban transgender people from serving in the military. I think in 2018 this impacted like [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=655.18s)]
*  14,000 trans service members and people who want to serve their country fight for their country [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=661.74s)]
*  They're getting thrown out of the military just for bigotry reasons [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=666.82s)]
*  The Pentagon is also killing DEI programs and will reinstate and give back pay to service members who are discharged [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=670.76s)]
*  For refusing to take the kovat vaccine now the CIA released a new assessment about the origins of kovat [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=677.32s)]
*  They now support the lab leak theory but with low confidence just worth noting because I'm sure a lot of people saw this story [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=683.12s)]
*  But this is a new assessment. It's not based on any new intelligence [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=689.2s)]
*  It's just an update based on what information they already had though talking to some people [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=692.36s)]
*  It sounds like the assessment might have changed during the Biden years and just got released now [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=696.92s)]
*  So I don't know once again, this is more like opaque than anything else. And then finally Ben [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=701.72s)]
*  Trump removed the security details for officials in his first administration who were involved in the assassination of Iranian General Cosmo Soleimani [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=706.72s)]
*  And have since been targeted for assassination by the Iranian regime. Those officials include Mike Pompeo [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=714.6s)]
*  John Bolton, Brian Hook [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=721.44s)]
*  And here's what Trump had to say when he was asked about this decision [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=723.44s)]
*  Fadji Ketchum Shrey's I think he also lost the security deal based on a non Iranian threats [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=754.36s)]
*  It's worth a noting bend it like a few months ago [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=759.5200000000001s)]
*  Republicans were attacking Joe Biden for not doing enough to protect Trump from Iranian threats and for not extending security details to other [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=762.1600000000001s)]
*  Trump officials who had been threatened by Iran. I guess now we just Trump wants them all to die [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=769.12s)]
*  I guess like my takeaways from this sort of series this group of personnel things is this is project 2025 [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=774.08s)]
*  Yes, you know, it's like they're vetting all these national security jobs for you know, ideological reasons and on top of that [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=782.36s)]
*  I mean it seems like the new plan is just to rip away Congress's role and appropriating all funding and call today [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=789.44s)]
*  Well, that's the core point here to all this and it connects back to the foreign aid freeze [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=794.84s)]
*  Which is a Trump is trying to completely centralize all power and control in the US government in his hands [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=799.0400000000001s)]
*  And in some people will say, you know the majoritarians that well he won the election and elections have consequences [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=804.5600000000001s)]
*  No, that has never happened before in American history [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=810.0s)]
*  It's still a constitution, you know, maybe it happened in the Civil War or something, right? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=812.4s)]
*  But the whole point is that things like government budgets and personnel in the system designed by the founding fathers that the Republicans [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=816.16s)]
*  Like to venerate was designed to make this a blended responsibility [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=823.5s)]
*  a lot of the programs that are funded that are being frozen were funded by Congress and [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=827.64s)]
*  Now Trump is coming in and saying no, I don't like that [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=832.56s)]
*  So that program that's already been appropriated the money's already been put it pushed out the door is just stopped the personnel piece [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=835.24s)]
*  You know when we join the NSC what people don't realize National Security Council in the White House [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=841.8000000000001s)]
*  It's about between two and three hundred people that coordinates all the actions of the US government national security [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=846.0s)]
*  The majority of the staff are not political hires. They're not people that are hired by a new president [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=850.96s)]
*  They are detailed their State Department or intelligence community or military personnel that are detailed to the NSC and [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=856.5200000000001s)]
*  By saying that they need loyalty tests or by firing all them [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=865.44s)]
*  That's both troubling because you're creating group think and you're creating a political lens to which you look at anything on national security [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=869.1s)]
*  You're also again as at the USAID [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=875.5200000000001s)]
*  You know firings or suspensions you're pushing tons of expertise out the window like we kept in place a good example, right? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=878.44s)]
*  Alyssa Slotkin [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=885.76s)]
*  And now she's gonna be a Democrat, but I didn't know what her politics were. She was a holdover from the Bush years [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=887.1600000000001s)]
*  She worked on Iraq. She knew the Iraqi politicians [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=892.48s)]
*  She knew what was going on in the Iraq war like if we had just gotten rid of her and everybody else [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=896.0s)]
*  We would have brought people in who had none of those relationships warm, you know [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=901.16s)]
*  And so all the people at the working level who manage relations with other countries, you know [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=904.8000000000001s)]
*  They're out the door because Trump wants a bunch of maga loyalists in you know, and and across the board here [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=909.88s)]
*  I think people need to see this for the massive sea change that it is [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=914.88s)]
*  If the entirety of the United States government very much a project 2025 agenda is [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=919.0799999999999s)]
*  You have to pass a loyalty test you have to be you know, first and foremost politically committed to Donald Trump and his agenda [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=924.16s)]
*  Despite what he says about merit-based expertise is devalued the diversity programs getting killed [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=931.0799999999999s)]
*  You know, you talked a bit this a little bit on PSA [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=937.92s)]
*  We want a military where you essentially have an increasingly diverse [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=942.1999999999999s)]
*  Collection of people the lower down you get just run by a bunch of white men [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=947.84s)]
*  It's a fucking dark thing to think about and it's not gonna be good for cohesion in the military [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=951.6s)]
*  It's not keeping good people. Yeah, we're keeping it's an up-and-out system [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=956.44s)]
*  Cuz then people are gonna leave and then what who's gonna stand up for the military? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=959.16s)]
*  Proud boys and Oath keepers or something because they want to be in an armed militia for Donald Trump [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=962.24s)]
*  So this kind of transformation the federal government very rapidly into the image of Donald Trump through money and personnel is is [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=966.96s)]
*  Chillingly smart and the way they're doing it because it is project 2025 [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=975.76s)]
*  They thought about it, but it's going to it's going to lead to very dangerous outcomes [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=979.9200000000001s)]
*  I also just like just on a practical level like who is doing work at the NSE right now [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=984.2s)]
*  You sent home a couple hundred people like it kind of the director level like these are workhorses [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=988.1600000000001s)]
*  These are people that are doing 16 hour days and you can't work from home. Everything you do is classified [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=992.96s)]
*  You have to be in a skiff. You have to be on your high side classified computer and have access to documents. It's like [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=996.96s)]
*  Is there's just no one at home yeah the NSE right now are they you know [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1003.08s)]
*  Scrambling to import new people from agencies that they've already vetted. I don't know well and you know later [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1007.4s)]
*  We'll talk about Congo right the DRC, you know [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1011.9200000000001s)]
*  Something like a crisis breaks out and none of the people that have been working on that country are there [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1015.52s)]
*  Do you think these random MAGA guys who've gone in the NSE know anything about what's happening there? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1020.96s)]
*  or in Syria for that matter know about they like [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1026.4s)]

*  We're also bed starting to see how Trump is gonna treat other countries in this administration and partners around the world [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1204.6399999999999s)]
*  We've talked a bunch about Trump's desire to take over Greenland. The Financial Times reported that Trump had a terrible call with the Danish prime minister [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1210.24s)]
*  Recently long story short the Prime Minister said Greenland is not for sale and tried to offer up [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1218.52s)]
*  You know more military cooperation or whatever more access to minerals in response Trump threatened her with tariffs [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1223.6799999999998s)]
*  So that will help NATO and then over the weekend the United States briefly entered into a little trade war with [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1231.1599999999999s)]
*  Colombia after Trump and Colombian President Gustavo Petro started fighting on Twitter about US migrant deportation flights [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1238.04s)]
*  And in like so that we don't need to relitigate all of what happened there [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1246.28s)]
*  But basically clearly Trump wanted this fight and it was a very high profile [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1250.84s)]
*  You know way for him to look like he got a win and it makes me think [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1255.3999999999999s)]
*  That all of these threats to slap tariffs on smaller countries like Mexico and Canada are very real [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1259.3999999999999s)]
*  It's still not clear to me what he's gonna do in terms of China tariffs because that will create real economic disruption [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1266.24s)]
*  But like if you're a liberal or leftist leader out there in the world like ducking cover, man [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1271.96s)]
*  Yeah, I mean first of all on Colombia [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1277.0s)]
*  You got a win which was instead of civilian flights their military flights landing in Colombia [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1280.3600000000001s)]
*  Like that's a totality of this win Congrats. It's a massive news cycle own [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1285.16s)]
*  I mean just it's Trump reflecting the stupidity of our news cycle that that is some kind of big win [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1289.88s)]
*  I think the common thread we can take away which is kind of the theme of this week's podcast [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1296.5600000000002s)]
*  What can we learn about how Trump's can operate? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1302.04s)]
*  Well, he's gonna bully the shit out of small countries and he's gonna bully shit out of countries that have laughter liberal leaders [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1303.8400000000001s)]
*  for kind of MAGA ends like immigration deportations or [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1310.28s)]
*  More alarming ends like territorial expansionism [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1314.3200000000002s)]
*  Vis-a-vis Greenland and everything we're hearing and I've want to thank actually I heard from some Danish world those and this [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1317.2s)]
*  You know clarifying all these points and but that what you can sense is the alarm [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1323.78s)]
*  And in terms of the why this matters again [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1329.4s)]
*  There's the obvious point I made earlier this thing about foreign assistance in China. It certainly applies in Latin America in the sense that [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1332.96s)]
*  That this is a region where China's made a lot of inroads Russia has some presence [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1340.28s)]
*  If you're Columbia you might fold on this but this incentivizes the hell for you to like [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1345.72s)]
*  Really ramp up your trade relationship with China [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1351.4s)]
*  To try and I think what people should look for is I bet you these Latin American countries are gonna start to band together [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1355.6399999999999s)]
*  Brazil Columbia [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1361.76s)]
*  Chile particularly, you know these places with [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1363.84s)]
*  Left-wing leaders to do more things collectively and to do more things with China or Europe it just anything but the United States [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1366.3999999999999s)]
*  They're gonna try to kind of US proof their their economies and societies to the best they can [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1372.6s)]
*  Tragically that tragically for our politics that that may not like be evident six months or a year from now [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1378.6399999999999s)]
*  But we're gonna look up five years from now and the world's gonna look very different [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1384.56s)]
*  Europe itself is probably going to go its own way on things like China [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1387.6399999999999s)]
*  And so this bears watching and the other thing is like when you know [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1391.72s)]
*  There's all this talk about allies and when you need allies. It's it's the for the thing you don't expect [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1394.68s)]
*  So if you are breaking NATO and alienating all of Europe by what you're doing to Denmark, you know the next time we need help [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1399.84s)]
*  These of the NATO or cooperation from some European country [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1408.12s)]
*  They're gonna be less inclined to give it because of this kind of thing Trump is you know [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1411.48s)]
*  Kicking the shit out of Colombia to take deportation flights [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1416.88s)]
*  Well, we're gonna need their help to fight the cartels if it really wants to do that [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1419.72s)]
*  We're you know to deal with the cocaine trade and you know, this is gonna you know, this is gonna come dude [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1423.56s)]
*  there's gonna be bill for this that comes due and [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1429.1200000000001s)]
*  Trump is counting on Americans having no attention span or capacity to connect the things [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1432.64s)]
*  He's doing to the outcomes that they won't like and that's the last point about terrorists like Americans [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1437.8799999999999s)]
*  remarkably [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1443.52s)]
*  Trump's terror trade wars with China and decoupling of supply chains of China were massive contributors to inflation under Joe Biden and somehow [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1445.28s)]
*  He escaped any any responsibility for that this time around [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1453.1s)]
*  I think it's gonna be apparent much quicker with all these actions on immigration and tariffs which are gonna be inflationary [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1456.84s)]
*  Yeah, everybody's looking for it at least [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1462.24s)]
*  The the petro was kind of designed in a lab to be a Trump opponent right? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1463.52s)]
*  He's a leftist former guerrilla Marxist in his teens. I think he was looking for a fight [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1468.6s)]
*  I reached out to a Latin America expert friend. I was like, what do you think happened here? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1473.76s)]
*  And he's like short answer. He's crazy and probably was drunk [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1477.04s)]
*  Longer answer. He's having trouble at home politically. So we picked a fight thinking he would benefit him [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1480.8s)]
*  And it did not go well because most Colombians were like wait, we don't want tariffs [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1485.64s)]
*  We don't want to lose visa access to United States. This is a bad idea [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1490.56s)]
*  but to your point, I mean it wasn't Columbia's a long-standing US ally, but it wasn't just Columbia that was [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1493.48s)]
*  Offended by some of these deportation flights [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1498.8s)]
*  It was a deportation flight from the US to Brazil [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1500.84s)]
*  where the guys got off the plane in Brazil and were still handcuffed and that [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1504.1200000000001s)]
*  Went super viral and a lot of parts of Latin America and upset a lot of leaders and the population there and was a real problem [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1508.3600000000001s)]
*  And then you know some of these other Latin American experts I was talking to were telling me that like the Panamanians were [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1514.48s)]
*  Excited and eager to work with Trump and then he came out of the gate [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1522.1999999999998s)]
*  Threatening to like invade them [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1526.4799999999998s)]
*  So everyone just kind of like reeling and trying to figure out what to do [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1528.6399999999999s)]
*  And it does seem like the only thing Trump cares about right now is deportation and I was talking to [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1532.0s)]
*  Daralyn yesterday for Paz America's immigration expert and she reminded me that you know [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1537.8s)]
*  We have no legal obligation to deport people back to their home countries [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1542.84s)]
*  They can just send them to any country and it sounds like El Salvador and Naib Bucaylee is like hand up [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1546.4399999999998s)]
*  I'll take in as many migrants as you want. Mr. Trump, which is just confusing if the first group [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1551.6399999999999s)]
*  Of deportation flights is supposed to be full of Venezuelan gang members [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1558.24s)]
*  Yeah, where is Bucaylee gonna put them in these existing overcrowded gangs where there's already like huge issues [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1562.12s)]
*  Is he gonna build new prisons? [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1568.74s)]
*  Like what is he getting in return like none of it makes sense [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1572.34s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't make sense [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1575.96s)]
*  It's not thought through it will have second and third order consequences whether in terms of you know countries aligning against us [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1577.96s)]
*  realigning but also, you know, I this is going to I think [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1585.92s)]
*  Permanently [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1591.68s)]
*  If you know certainly long term [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1592.8s)]
*  Transform the view of the United States around the world which you know has been up and down as it is [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1595.2s)]
*  I think the first Trump term was kind of like [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1601.3600000000001s)]
*  Is this the Americans is it an aberration is this an aberration and then it was like Biden and they're like [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1603.64s)]
*  It's not that everybody loved everything Joe Biden did including us [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1608.5600000000002s)]
*  But now we are the country that puts people [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1611.72s)]
*  including children on military planes wearing leg irons and handcuffs and [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1615.68s)]
*  flies into random countries and [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1620.68s)]
*  And you don't ever stop being that country because people think rightly that Americans voted for that, you know [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1622.8000000000002s)]
*  And and I just don't think we recognize that [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1627.96s)]
*  You know that makes us Russia and China, you know [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1631.52s)]
*  we're no different than we're just a big country that does whatever the fuck we want no matter how bad it looks no matter how [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1634.22s)]
*  offensive it is to people and [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1638.92s)]
*  If Americans think that they didn't benefit at all from being a little different than that then [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1642.3200000000002s)]
*  Though those those those great years you want to go back to were the high point of when we were kind of the steward of those [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1648.96s)]
*  Rules, you know in the post-world war two era [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1655.28s)]
*  So I just think this is gonna be worse than people are [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1658.3999999999999s)]
*  Contemplating right now in terms of the blowback. Yeah speaking of blowback [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1662.04s)]
*  I mean Gaza is the focus of my conversation with Peter Beinart [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1665.08s)]
*  So we're gonna dig into that too deeply here [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1668.48s)]
*  But we did want to play for you the kind of latest policy float for the future of Gaza from President Trump [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1670.28s)]
*  I said to him I'd love you to take on more [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1677.04s)]
*  As I'm looking at the whole Gaza strip right now and it's a mess [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1680.7800000000002s)]
*  Since you'd like Jordans house people from Gaza to take people [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1685.38s)]
*  I'd like Egypt to take people I'm meeting with I'm talking to [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1690.1000000000001s)]
*  General of CC tomorrow sometime I believe and I'd like Egypt to take people and I'd like George to take people I could [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1695.5s)]
*  You're talking about [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1703.94s)]
*  Probably a million and a half people [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1706.3000000000002s)]
*  And [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1708.7s)]
*  We just clean out that whole thing. It's you know, it's over the centuries. That's that's many many conflicts at site [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1709.78s)]
*  and I don't know it's something has to happen, but [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1717.34s)]
*  It's it's literally they demolish inside right now almost everything's demolished and people are dying there so I'd rather [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1721.6599999999999s)]
*  Get involved with some of the Arab nations and build housing in a different location where they could maybe [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1729.94s)]
*  Live in peace [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1736.9s)]
*  Could be either could be temporarily could be long term. So that's the president United States [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1739.66s)]
*  Proposing the ethnic cleansing of Gaza. It's straight-up ethnic cleansing [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1745.3400000000001s)]
*  That's the only thing it is and it's denying the existence of a Palestinian people which who date back thousands of years, right? [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1749.5800000000002s)]
*  The people have been living there in that space who are Palestinian and saying well because they're Arab they can just move to some other Arab country [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1757.78s)]
*  And you know number one the Palestinians don't want to leave because they know that if they are moved to Egypt or Jordan [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1765.1s)]
*  They'll never go back to Gaza and Trump doesn't know pretend that it was done [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1772.74s)]
*  Nobody believes that they will go back to Gaza because there are still Palestinian refugees in Jordan in in Lebanon in [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1775.58s)]
*  Surrounding countries who've never been able to go back from you know [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1783.1s)]
*  48 or 67 or whatever disruption took place in the past so the Palestinian people don't want this so it's not like charity for them [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1786.62s)]
*  Because it denies their existence and ethnically cleanses their territories, you know secondly [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1794.1s)]
*  Egypt and Jordan do not want these people know and they made that clear. These are these are vulnerable governments that [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1799.9399999999998s)]
*  Don't have money to pay for this [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1807.1799999999998s)]
*  I would not be surprised to see a kind of Arab Spring type uprising in either of those countries for different reasons in the coming [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1809.46s)]
*  Years Egypt because it's a brittle corrupt military dictatorship [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1815.6599999999999s)]
*  Jordan because frankly, there's a lot of dissatisfaction with how the Palestinian issue has been handled and already two million or so [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1819.2199999999998s)]
*  Palestinians and so you introduce a bunch of new people into that already combustible dynamic [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1826.6999999999998s)]
*  You could get that kind of instability there [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1831.9599999999998s)]
*  That's probably why some of the other Arab states are not going to be too keen on this as well [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1833.7399999999998s)]
*  And then lastly again these people take responsibility for nothing [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1838.28s)]
*  I mean we've talked about the fact that the Abraham Accords [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1842.9799999999998s)]
*  That cut the Palestinians out of the deal and was celebrated as this big, you know [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1846.1000000000001s)]
*  Peace deal by Trump and a lot of people frankly [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1850.26s)]
*  ignored the fact that that [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1853.94s)]
*  Empowered Hamas because they're cut out any political process. They have no hope for a state and and that leads to October 7th [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1856.74s)]
*  I like I know people don't like hearing this. It doesn't make it. Okay [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1864.22s)]
*  It makes Hamas is responsible for October 7th [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1868.22s)]
*  But causally if you create no political horizon for people you incentivize [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1870.86s)]
*  Violent resistance as the only means for political organization and Palestinian territories anymore [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1876.4199999999998s)]
*  And so we just people don't like to hear this but we have to name it because it's going to happen and Peter actually in his [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1880.46s)]
*  Book digs into a lot of the data on this like polling around support for violence [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1886.6s)]
*  Yeah against Israelis among the Palestinian population and it directly corresponds with times where there's sort of hope of a political [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1891.4399999999998s)]
*  Accommodation and the future in a Palestinian state in times when there is no hope [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1898.82s)]
*  Yeah, no surprise in those moments support for violence goes up. But also I mean to your point [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1902.1799999999998s)]
*  I we shouldn't be surprised by this right because remember a year or so ago Jared Kushner went and spoke to a class at Harvard [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1907.36s)]
*  He started talking about how Gaza was like beachfront property and good for condos and how you know [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1914.02s)]
*  It should be bulldozed and you just ship all the Palestinians out to the Egyptian desert like well, here it is government policy [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1919.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and that's I mean that's a very believable [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1924.98s)]
*  Plan that's in their heads. Yes [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1928.58s)]
*  That's how they look at the world as real estate corrupt real estate developers because that's what they are and what? [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1929.96s)]
*  What then Yahoo would loved because that would be exactly the gift his right-wing coalition wants and will help him [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1934.3s)]
*  They want to ethnically cleanse Gaza and the West Bank and we'll see how that goes fun a great development [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1940.34s)]
*  Okay. Well, let's turn to a very different part of the world [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1947.34s)]
*  But there's an equally troubling development happening in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo or DRC for short [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1949.8999999999999s)]
*  Where a Rwandan back rebel group called m23 says it is captured Goma [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1956.6200000000001s)]
*  Which is a city of over 1 million people in the eastern DRC. It's right on the border with Rwanda [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1962.0600000000002s)]
*  So m23 is a rebel group that operates out of the eastern eastern DRC [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1967.4s)]
*  It was formed by soldiers that mutinied from the Congolese army back in 2012 [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1973.1000000000001s)]
*  It's mostly made up of the Tutsi ethnic group [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1978.64s)]
*  The name m23 is a reference to March 23rd 2009, which is the date of a failed [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1981.7s)]
*  2009 peace agreement that these soldiers who mute need are angry about [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1987.3s)]
*  The DRC the US in the UN of all accused Rwanda providing weapons and logistical support to the m23 and in some cases [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1991.94s)]
*  Basically commanding them as a mercenary force last year [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=1999.78s)]
*  Rwanda even deployed three or four thousand troops to Congo to support these m23 fighters that are getting even more brazen about it [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2003.5800000000002s)]
*  The m23 briefly occupied Goma back in 2012, but were driven out and then just kind of lay dormant for about a decade [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2010.24s)]
*  But this year they've made this rapid advance on the city into the Congo and on Friday [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2016.28s)]
*  Things got really bad the military governor of North Kivu [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2023.28s)]
*  Which is the province where where goma's in or go as the capital was killed on the battlefield on Saturday [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2026.16s)]
*  The UN peacekeeping mission in Goma was evacuated 13 peacekeepers had already been killed and the UN says that this year [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2031.4s)]
*  400,000 people have fled their homes [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2039.68s)]
*  Joining the millions who have already been displaced in Eastern Congo [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2042.08s)]
*  So officials in the US and the UN say that they think that m23 is goal is now to occupy Goma and do so [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2045.32s)]
*  For the long term so they can exploit these valuable mineral resources in the area [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2053.2s)]
*  There are a lot of metals like cobalt copper lithium that are key components in [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2057.1s)]
*  Electrical vehicle batteries and other green technology and are worth trillions of dollars literally so Ben I'll pause there [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2062.0s)]
*  I mean, this is there's a lot of history here we could get into but it's a very [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2068.32s)]
*  Worrisome development because m23 is a brutal group known to commit atrocities [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2072.6400000000003s)]
*  to torture to rape [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2078.56s)]
*  And just do brutal acts to people and including to civilians and you know [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2080.6800000000003s)]
*  This fighting is likely to displace hundreds of thousands or millions of people [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2085.1800000000003s)]
*  And could risk a wider war across the region in a region that has seen some really [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2089.4s)]
*  devastating [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2095.0800000000004s)]
*  Ethnic tribal violence over the past, you know decades [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2096.52s)]
*  Yeah, you said it [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2100.48s)]
*  well [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2102.2s)]
*  I mean this dates all the way back to the Rwandan genocide and you know in the initial years after that when Rwanda started [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2102.36s)]
*  intervening in [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2109.7599999999998s)]
*  the politics of the DRC it was ostensibly to kind of go after some of the remnants of because the [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2111.6s)]
*  the groups backed by Rwanda and the DRC are Tutsis and you know, they're going after [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2118.8s)]
*  The ethnic groups that you know were obviously participants in the genocide but over time [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2125.04s)]
*  What's become clear is that this is? [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2130.7599999999998s)]
*  Increase you know, basically a resource play there's a tons of natural resources in DRC ever since the Belgians [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2132.8799999999997s)]
*  Colonized the place. It's been exploited for that purpose [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2139.8399999999997s)]
*  And you summed up, you know the this is a horrific group that is committed, you know, rape is a weapon of war [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2142.92s)]
*  Mass atrocities you could have mass displacement of people could destabilize that part of Africa more generally [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2150.6s)]
*  I think that it also is indicative of a new reality where [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2156.36s)]
*  There's just this kind of normalization of territorial expansionism of saying, you know, if you're Rwanda like well, you know [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2162.12s)]
*  Now it's the time to make our play right and why now question, right the why now question [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2168.8s)]
*  I don't know that that's the exact answer [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2173.32s)]
*  But you kind of look around and you see Russia and Ukraine and you see Israel and Gaza and you see [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2175.24s)]
*  You know what's happening in Sudan? [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2181.3199999999997s)]
*  Chinese are I in Taiwan and then you see the US talking about Panama and Greenland [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2184.0s)]
*  I'm not suggesting that's like directly what's happening here [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2187.4399999999996s)]
*  But this is one more instance where a country is comfortable just erasing the whole norm of state sovereignty [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2189.96s)]
*  that is the most core rule in the world to prevent future wars and [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2196.52s)]
*  You know, we should just be concerned about a world in which it's increasingly [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2201.7999999999997s)]
*  Acceptable or at least normal for countries to do that and just you know for I guess we're kind of shadow boxing though [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2206.56s)]
*  Why should I care people now because the Trump administration like [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2213.2799999999997s)]
*  first of all, obviously [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2216.7999999999997s)]
*  Thousands and thousands of hundreds of thousands of people in the Rwanda genocide getting killed is a horrible thing morally and something we should try [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2218.4399999999996s)]
*  To prevent but also I mean disruptions like this lead to mass migration [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2224.9199999999996s)]
*  They can disrupt neighboring governments, right? I mean, I think like conflict is going to fuel people leaving [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2229.32s)]
*  Rwanda or Congo [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2236.8s)]
*  and [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2238.8s)]
*  Create problems at all kinds of other ways that are not expected and like we saw in Europe after [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2239.8s)]
*  The Syrian Civil War and it's just like something worth thinking about like these things ripple out in ways that are always negative [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2244.44s)]
*  They ripple out they they ripple out in terms of the flow and migration of peoples not just into places like Europe [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2249.28s)]
*  But if you know, if suddenly you start having huge strains on key African economies [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2255.52s)]
*  You know the global economy is connected. It creates potential financial crises. It creates ripple effects in that regard [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2260.76s)]
*  Obviously of the humanitarian [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2268.32s)]
*  impacts of this [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2270.52s)]
*  It's just a it just contributes to global disorder which tends to have negative consequences on [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2272.2s)]
*  again flow of people flow of goods global economy and [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2279.2s)]
*  You know, it's just a and you know not to be callous about it because this is not as important as human lives [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2283.2s)]
*  There's a lot of natural resources in that part of Africa that Americans depend upon like [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2290.3599999999997s)]
*  Where do you think the fucking batteries in your Tesla phones come from? [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2293.94s)]
*  Your Tesla comes from, you know cobalt mines and lithium mines and and so this is connected. Everything is connected. Yeah [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2297.48s)]
*  We talked a lot about competition with China in this show and sort of going forward [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2306.0s)]
*  There was a major inflection point in that competition last week when a Chinese AI startup called deep seek [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2311.4399999999996s)]
*  Released a 22 page research paper and an AI chat bot model called deep seek r1 [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2317.04s)]
*  What made this release different from all the other kind of new AI models you keep hearing about like llama or clod or whatever? [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2322.7999999999997s)]
*  Fucking nerdy name [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2329.8399999999997s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg gives them was that these research these researchers claim to have built a model [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2331.16s)]
*  That was nearly as good as the top American made models like chat GBT [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2336.76s)]
*  But they did so at a fraction of the cost and with inferior hardware and plus on top of that deep seek was released as open [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2341.7200000000003s)]
*  Store software meaning experts could look at the guts of how it worked and actually confirmed that actually something interesting had happened here [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2348.6200000000003s)]
*  So all of this these developments completely flipped out Silicon Valley [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2354.1600000000003s)]
*  Some political leaders and then finally the stock market on Monday [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2358.48s)]
*  Which saw a huge sell-off of tech company shares including shares of AI companies like Nvidia [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2361.86s)]
*  Which makes the top-of-the-line AI chips? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2367.3s)]
*  I think they lost nearly 600 billion in market cap that day alone though. It rebounded some on Tuesday today [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2369.3s)]
*  But the reason being American AI companies are spending ungodly amounts of money [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2376.06s)]
*  Stockpiling the most powerful Nvidia chips [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2382.34s)]
*  Because they want to train and power their AI models and the US government has put export controls on a lot of those chips [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2385.06s)]
*  To prevent the Chinese from getting them and that it seems like despite all of that this little Chinese startup may have developed just a smarter [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2391.82s)]
*  Design or piece of software that could upend all of the economics of the artificial intelligence industry [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2398.82s)]
*  In other words China may have proven that they can build an AI product on a five point five million dollar budget [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2405.34s)]
*  That is nearly as good as the models that required billions of dollars of advanced chips to create now [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2410.54s)]
*  There's a few reasons to be skeptical of this announcement [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2417.32s)]
*  First it does seem deliberate that a Chinese company released deep seek the week after Trump did this splashy event where he announced the [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2420.7400000000002s)]
*  $500 billion AI project with open AI softbank and Oracle [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2427.46s)]
*  It seems like they were trying to stick it to him a bit and then second that five point five million dollar budget figure is [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2431.06s)]
*  Certainly a massive understatement like even the deep seek are one research paper [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2437.6200000000003s)]
*  Says that the figure does not include quote cost associated with prior research and ablation experiments on architectures algorithms and data [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2442.06s)]
*  I understand most of those words [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2449.46s)]
*  But also the experts think that the r1 model was built off of previous work that this company had done that involved like yeah [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2452.02s)]
*  Top line of video chips and they also seem to have used chat GBT and other existing models to train it that said [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2459.02s)]
*  All the experts seem to think this is a big deal [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2464.82s)]
*  It's a massive step forward in terms of AI efficiency and a lot of that stock market freakout came after [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2467.34s)]
*  The deep deep seek app was number one in the American App Store [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2472.66s)]
*  Which showed these American companies that [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2476.92s)]
*  American consumers were like psyched for a cheaper easier model and it made them all vulnerable [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2480.16s)]
*  So then long wind up from me [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2485.8s)]
*  I wonder what you made all of this and whether you think that egg-shaped venture capitalist Mark Andreessen is correct [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2488.36s)]
*  When he says that this is AI's Sputnik moment [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2494.96s)]
*  This is really important and I spent a lot of time working on this and so I'll try to give some context here [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2498.88s)]
*  This should not be surprising so [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2506.34s)]
*  it's been clear for [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2509.5s)]
*  not a year, but many months that the [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2512.1800000000003s)]
*  assumptions that the Biden administration and [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2516.86s)]
*  Some of the tech world had made about AI were wrong in that the restrictions on chips [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2520.54s)]
*  The export controls in place on China were going to somehow cripple their industry relative to ours because China has [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2526.38s)]
*  Really plowed a lot of resources into their own indigenous AI, so they've got really good talent [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2533.64s)]
*  So they're as you know, they're as many if not more Chinese people who are really good AI designers and developers as from anywhere else [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2539.12s)]
*  They're figuring out even before deep seek they were figuring out how to train models on less computing power [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2546.24s)]
*  So that means you don't need massive data centers with all the fancy Nvidia chips to train your models to create something like this [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2553.3199999999997s)]
*  And this kind of proves that theory and then importantly [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2559.92s)]
*  Because of you know meta for instance, they they open source their model, right? So for instance with you [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2564.7200000000003s)]
*  Open AI doesn't open source their model [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2573.28s)]
*  But you know when chat GPT is released, you know smart people can look at it and reverse engineer it [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2575.0s)]
*  Meta went further than that because they were behind and so they like open source like let's show everybody all the code [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2579.76s)]
*  Let's show our work because we love openness because Mark Zuckerberg is a good man [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2585.0s)]
*  But then the Chinese could just look at that and be like well [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2589.48s)]
*  We don't have all the chips that these guys had to produce the thing [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2592.6400000000003s)]
*  But they're literally showing us how their models work and so we'll just copy it [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2594.96s)]
*  You know so this idea and again the Biden people did some good work in this space [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2598.0s)]
*  But I I think they've been wrong about this for a little while the idea that you could just build a wall around AI [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2601.6800000000003s)]
*  And then the Chinese would never catch up was always had a hole in it [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2606.0s)]
*  We wouldn't ship them the cows, but they could just get some milk for free [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2609.1600000000003s)]
*  Right, so this is what was gonna happen and it's happened right and [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2613.28s)]
*  And the consequences are that [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2618.08s)]
*  There's potentially a huge AI bubble [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2621.52s)]
*  I mean not to get too much into kind of the that Mark Andreessen of this all he doesn't care about Sputnik [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2624.0s)]
*  he cares about money and [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2629.0s)]
*  The in VB Nvidia stock price was way up based on the assumption that anybody wanted AI was gonna need all these Nvidia chips [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2630.88s)]
*  Well, maybe not right and so all these numbers and share prices [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2637.48s)]
*  Were kind of predicated on the idea that you needed to spend 500 billion dollars to build AI and it makes Trump's announcement look kind [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2641.92s)]
*  of ridiculous because it suggests that you know these guys are just [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2648.36s)]
*  500 billion dollars to give to Sam Altman to train some models when you got some Chinese engineers sitting in Beijing [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2653.1200000000003s)]
*  With five million dollars, and yeah, I'm sure it's more than that [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2658.96s)]
*  But it's certainly not a 500 billion like doing the same thing and so it kind of upends all these assumptions and lastly to the geopolitical [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2661.76s)]
*  competition point [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2667.76s)]
*  It suggests that you know, the Chinese has something to offer other countries that is cheaper, right? [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2669.52s)]
*  So if you're a third country that wants to buy AI [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2675.7599999999998s)]
*  Technologies or an AI infrastructure [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2679.36s)]
*  You can either jump through all the hoops of American export controls and buy the high-end stuff [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2681.48s)]
*  They cost you know 10x more than the Chinese stuff or you can show the Chinese and get some cheap AI [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2687.52s)]
*  Yeah, just that and by the way last point that is what happened with Huawei, right? [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2692.6s)]
*  Huawei is like hey we have a cheaper telecom product and guess who bought it everybody everybody bought it [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2697.16s)]
*  And so this is this is a big big deal. It's a big deal [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2702.24s)]
*  And so you're right. There's some interesting winners and losers like Nvidia, which it's an interesting story [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2705.2s)]
*  They were like a computer game like graphics chip design company that just turned up the chips [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2710.88s)]
*  They were making were really really great for this kind of AI [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2715.88s)]
*  Training and research and these large language models. So yeah, there is an assumption built into their stock share price that [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2718.48s)]
*  Companies are gonna buy billions if not trillions of dollars worth of their chips over the coming decade [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2725.3199999999997s)]
*  And if that's not the case they are in deep shit or at least people who bought higher in deep shit [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2729.6s)]
*  But for like for companies like say an Apple that are kind of consumers of AI [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2733.7599999999998s)]
*  Products or software like they put it on your phone so you can use it [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2739.7599999999998s)]
*  They might actually benefit from this if it's a little cheaper and more efficient to make this stuff [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2742.6s)]
*  Yeah, so sort of an interesting test case the one thing you shouldn't do [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2746.4399999999996s)]
*  on a deep seek [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2750.24s)]
*  Our one AI model is ask it about Tiananmen Square [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2752.0s)]
*  Yeah, or any of the various kind of censored topics in China like that is a think a fatal flaw [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2755.68s)]
*  This software and that it's all censored and built off of censored information systems, etc. But um, yeah [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2763.96s)]
*  I mean, it's a pretty impressive pretty impressive moment. I don't know about Sputnik [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2770.2s)]
*  I mean the Sputnik thing it's like everything is interesting said it's a Sputnik moment and I saw Chuck Schumer quoting [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2773.68s)]
*  The Sputnik moment thing and then lefty's getting mad at Schumer and it's like, I don't know [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2780.3199999999997s)]
*  Maybe he's calling it a Sputnik moment because in recent just wants more money [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2784.3599999999997s)]
*  Well, that's the point is what is been recent one [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2788.2799999999997s)]
*  He wants more money plowed into AI that he's invested in so you call it Sputnik to justify that spending, you know [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2791.04s)]
*  These guys all care about competition. We're trying to know your point about the the the censorship is important [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2796.8399999999997s)]
*  They're ultimately in the end a chat bot is gonna be better if it's not, you know built with all these kind of CCP [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2802.4399999999996s)]
*  Censorship things but what people have to remember is like the vast majority of the uses a of AI [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2809.7999999999997s)]
*  Are not gonna be like chat GPT. No, it's like Google. It's or it's like robots. It's like industrial efficiency [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2814.9199999999996s)]
*  It's like making your factory work better. That's what the Chinese care about [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2820.7999999999997s)]
*  they've got like a one child problem where they need to replace workers with machines and [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2824.08s)]
*  And and that this suggests this this innovation suggests that their innovation in other AI spaces is probably pretty good, too [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2828.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2836.3999999999996s)]
*  Fascinating story. Yeah [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2837.64s)]
*  couple more things from us so a couple of Syria updates Ben's so [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2840.0s)]
*  First we saw the European Union has taken some steps forward on sanctions relief for Syria [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2843.24s)]
*  They've agreed in principle to use sanctions on financial institutions energy and transportation sectors, but I don't think it's done yet [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2848.2s)]
*  They haven't ironed out all the details but like some progress in the right direction [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2855.42s)]
*  Also, there was an interesting report in the Washington Post about how the Biden administration back in December shared intelligence with HTS [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2858.92s)]
*  Islamist group that overthrew the Assad regime about threats from ISIS specifically [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2867.92s)]
*  The Biden Intel community warned HTS about an ISIS plot to set off a bomb at a Shiite shrine [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2874.32s)]
*  In the Damascus suburbs that obviously would have been awful because it would have killed people [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2881.68s)]
*  But also that's the kind of action that in the past has set off waves of sectarian violence [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2886.16s)]
*  So very good that it was thwarted now officials quoted in the story say [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2891.84s)]
*  This intelligence was mostly shared because of the intelligence community's duty to warn [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2896.0s)]
*  Intended victims of an attack and not a sign of a growing relationship with HTS [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2900.6s)]
*  But it was notable and interesting and then finally Ben the new Syrian government has apparently canceled its contract with a Russian company that was managing [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2905.7599999999998s)]
*  Operations at the Tartus port. This is separate from Russia's contract to keep a naval base in Tartu [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2914.9199999999996s)]
*  So the future of that military presence, I think is still up in the air [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2920.62s)]
*  But it does seem like a sign of waning Russian influence in Syria [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2923.8399999999997s)]
*  Yes, something we were kind of watching since the beginning [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2928.48s)]
*  Yeah [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2930.74s)]
*  No [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2931.16s)]
*  we said that the Europeans have more incentive to move faster on sanctions relief because you know, I mean [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2931.4399999999996s)]
*  Virtuously, they want the government to succeed [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2937.48s)]
*  Probably self-interested they want Syria to be a place that's more successful. So some refugees might return home to Syria [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2940.3599999999997s)]
*  They're also just closer but the Russian peace also speaks to the geopolitics of this [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2946.48s)]
*  I mean obviously HTS and Syrian oppositionists hate Russia. They bombed them for many years, you know [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2950.64s)]
*  And so it does feel like that, you know, this isn't the end of Russian presence in that Tartus area [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2956.3599999999997s)]
*  But you know, it's definitely trending in that direction. I hope so and then finally Ben [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2961.92s)]
*  Let's talk about buddies in France. They do some things better than anyone else in the world wine [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2966.3199999999997s)]
*  cheese [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2972.2s)]
*  inscrutable films bread bread [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2973.68s)]
*  Cigarettes, I don't know do we do better things. Maybe they just look cool [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2976.52s)]
*  I mean they smoke them better. Yeah, and they can smoke them in more places [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2979.6s)]
*  They also do outrage and disdain pretty well [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2985.16s)]
*  Which is those latter two were on full display in this great story from the Wall Street Journal that we wanted to highlight about [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2987.16s)]
*  French president Emmanuel Macron's plan to leave his mark on French history. So listeners probably remember [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2992.24s)]
*  When Notre Dame Cathedral nearly burned to the ground back in 2019 [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=2999.56s)]
*  Macron promised at the time that he would return the Cathedral to its former glory and to his great credit [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3004.2799999999997s)]
*  He did and they rebuilt it and they did that reopening ceremony recently [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3009.2s)]
*  But apparently that accomplishment is not enough for him [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3013.3599999999997s)]
*  Macron wants to leave his mark on Notre Dame itself by swapping out some of the 19th century stained glass that survived the fire [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3016.9599999999996s)]
*  With contemporary pains made from an artist picked from a competition that I guess said they said they would give the building quote a modern accent [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3025.2799999999997s)]
*  Then you'll be shocked to hear that the French public fucking hates this idea [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3033.3999999999996s)]
*  Along with pretty much everything else Macron does 21% approval rating French to do this better than us to hate their president [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3038.44s)]
*  They're president [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3044.08s)]
*  They're still gonna so over a quarter million people signed a petition opposing the idea [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3044.88s)]
*  The opposition parties say they're gonna block him and France's chief preservation organization plans to oppose them move through the courts [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3049.04s)]
*  there's also a bunch of like memes about what the French pains would be some pictures of [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3056.2s)]
*  Went up online showing stained glass of Macron [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3060.7599999999998s)]
*  Crown and then others of him and his wife, which he kind of like looking over the name [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3064.3199999999997s)]
*  I'll be when I first saw the headline of the story. I thought Macron was proposing [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3068.7999999999997s)]
*  Stained-glass images of himself in Notre Dame, but luckily no though [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3074.3599999999997s)]
*  I do feel like what he's missing is a political adviser that is just with him all the time who says do less [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3078.2s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I mean just do a little bit less. Yeah [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3084.48s)]
*  Well, first of all, I'm sure that he was envisioning pictures of himself on the stained glass [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3086.52s)]
*  Yeah, but this is a Macron as much as any politician I can think of in recent memory is [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3091.36s)]
*  Really excellent at turning wins into losses, you know [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3097.72s)]
*  So the guy gets like a picture guy gets a rare win on the Notre Dame [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3101.48s)]
*  Construction reopening and you think that I'd be good enough [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3106.52s)]
*  You think he just take it everybody remember well the things he did now people gonna remember like fuck that guy [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3109.24s)]

*  Great to see you your book starts with a note to a former friend [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3457.3s)]
*  One with whom you had a falling out over your views about the war in Gaza [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3462.42s)]
*  As I read it it felt very familiar to me [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3467.82s)]
*  It felt like a lot of conversations I'd had although I obviously I'm Protestant [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3470.8s)]
*  I feel them in a different I think probably less personal way [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3475.8s)]
*  But I was wondering was this a letter to someone specific [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3479.0s)]
*  Was this a literary device that told a broader story about some isolation you might feel? [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3482.6400000000003s)]
*  As a devout Jew and opponent of this war maybe some combination [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3488.6400000000003s)]
*  But can you tell us about the letter and like kind of what it says about these debates you're having sure [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3492.3s)]
*  So, you know one of the central metaphors in Jewish tradition is the metaphor of family kind of an imagined kind of extended family [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3497.36s)]
*  You know beneath Israel the children of Israel [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3504.2000000000003s)]
*  Israel is the name of the Jacob is given after he wrestles with the angel and so and I was raised that way to think [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3506.2000000000003s)]
*  about Jesus a kind of a family and [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3511.2400000000002s)]
*  One of you know, one of the lines that Jews often quote is call Israel [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3513.7200000000003s)]
*  I have even said by that all Jews are responsible for each other [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3516.92s)]
*  So and so it's really difficult when you're raised that way to look around at what your community is doing when you feel this [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3519.36s)]
*  Obligation for solidarity especially in the wake of a horrifying trauma like October 7th when people feel this desire for need for solidarity [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3526.3599999999997s)]
*  Because they're going through so much grief and say I think we're taking a terrible mistake here [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3533.96s)]
*  Not just a mistake [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3539.4s)]
*  But this is profoundly morally wrong what Israel is doing in Gaza and when people are looking for solidarity and they're in pain [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3540.3199999999997s)]
*  They often don't take very well to people who they feel like are traitors. And so I've had this experience [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3546.8399999999997s)]
*  I had a plumb for October 7th [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3553.0s)]
*  But especially since October 7th many people who have been close to me and my family [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3554.9199999999996s)]
*  responding with tremendous tremendous anger at my public opposition to the war and my questioning of the very basis of [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3559.6s)]
*  The nature of a state that privileges Jews over Palestinians [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3567.6s)]
*  and so I what I wanted to try to say to them and then more broadly to the reader is [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3571.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm not coming as an outsider to this [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3575.2s)]
*  I care as passionately about our people and our future safety as you do [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3577.96s)]
*  And I want to maintain a relationship with you of conversation [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3582.84s)]
*  but I want to try to make you rethink some things because when our [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3586.6s)]
*  communal leadership is [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3591.32s)]
*  Justifying the the destruction of a society where the buildings the universities the agriculture the schools [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3592.96s)]
*  They're all destroyed and and we think that's okay [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3599.4s)]
*  Or we come up with these flimsy talking points to defend it like something's gone wrong [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3602.08s)]
*  One passage from that letter that really resonated with me and it just I felt like I was a part of a conversation that I've [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3606.32s)]
*  Been having was quote. That's why I titled this book being Jewish after the destruction of Gaza not being Jewish after October 7th [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3611.84s)]
*  It's not because I minimize that day like you I remain shaken by its horror [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3618.36s)]
*  I chose the former as a title because I know you grapple with the terror of that day [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3622.7200000000003s)]
*  I worry that you don't grapple sufficiently with the terror of the days that followed and proceeded it as well [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3626.6s)]
*  And it just it made me think of a text chain I have an endless [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3633.28s)]
*  Circular text chain debate about Gaza with a friend that I've had for over a year now [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3638.04s)]
*  And I feel like underpinning that [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3643.6s)]
*  Conversation is an unstated belief on this other person's side that preventing another October 7th [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3647.04s)]
*  Justifies inflicting any amount of pain on Gaza. That's been the hardest thing to kind of wrap my head around right is that [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3654.12s)]
*  Kind of moral assertion that I [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3661.96s)]
*  Can't get this person to question. Yes. That was also what led me to write the book [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3666.16s)]
*  I was just going through my life and you know, maybe like you I was seeing these images from Gaza [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3670.48s)]
*  And I wasn't even seeing the worst stuff [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3674.12s)]
*  But I was seeing enough and hearing from friends who had Gaza and from you know people who had family in Gaza [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3675.84s)]
*  And I was thinking this is one of the greatest [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3680.64s)]
*  Cataclysm is one of the greatest crimes of my lifetime this destruction of this entire place [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3684.32s)]
*  I mean the number of children killed in Gaza just dwarfs the number of children killed in Ukraine that Gaza now according to you and [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3689.44s)]
*  Has the most child amputees of any place in modern history, right? [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3695.2000000000003s)]
*  And there's so many bodies that I can't even be buried, you know, I mean, it's just grotesque [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3699.56s)]
*  It's horrifying and and you see good decent people who are ethical in the rest of their lives kind people and then they they seem [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3704.52s)]
*  To be just not seeing what I'm seeing and I and I so the book I wanted to interrogate the stories [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3712.4s)]
*  That we tell in the Jewish community which I think also American politicians tell which have the effect of [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3717.54s)]
*  Justifying what I think is the unjustifiable by essentially not really seeing Palestinians as full human beings because this is the tragedy [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3724.34s)]
*  I I also you know when we when these really hostages come out from Gaza like thank God [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3731.1400000000003s)]
*  We know their names right because they have their lives are sacred [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3737.06s)]
*  They have infinite value [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3741.2000000000003s)]
*  But we don't know the names of any of those Palestinian kids and other people who get killed in Gaza, right? [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3742.42s)]
*  Like they're a faceless mass is like they're they're they're not considered of equal worth and that violates the Judaism that I believe in [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3747.38s)]
*  Can you tell us you talk about these these stories and narratives that go back centuries? [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3754.44s)]
*  That that Jews tell themselves especially around the holidays [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3759.78s)]
*  Can you talk about you know some of those and how you think it's impacted the debate about Gaza on October 7th? [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3762.5s)]
*  Yeah, so one of the points that I make is that Jewish tradition [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3768.1800000000003s)]
*  Depicts Jews in a whole range of different ways because we're human beings [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3771.6200000000003s)]
*  So we're capable of all the different kinds of experiences that any other group of human beings are capable of but so often when [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3775.98s)]
*  Today when when Jews recount our own stories [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3781.82s)]
*  These are the stories get boiled down to stories of victimhood and survival in which we are kind of history's permanent righteous victims [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3784.5400000000004s)]
*  And my point is if you look at the book of Esther Francis with Jews [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3791.82s)]
*  We all holiday Purim which many Jews talk about as a story in which there's an attempted genocide against the Jews [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3794.98s)]
*  That's true [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3800.7599999999998s)]
*  but the story that ends with this massacre by the Jews of [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3801.56s)]
*  Their adversaries and I think if we saw the complexity in our tradition [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3804.8799999999997s)]
*  Then it might help us to recognize that putting trying to put in Israel and Palestine in this framework in which the Palestinians are the [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3808.8799999999997s)]
*  reincarnation of the Nazis or the [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3816.3999999999996s)]
*  Reincarnation of the anti-semites in the Russian Empire because that's always the role that Jews are in it just [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3818.4399999999996s)]
*  Fundamentally gets what's going on there wrong [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3824.9199999999996s)]
*  You because Palestinians are the ones who lack basic human rights and if you don't understand start with that understanding [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3827.32s)]
*  You're not going to be under able to understand the violence that threatens both groups of people there [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3834.4s)]
*  And you're not going to be able to actually make everybody safer. I wondered reading that [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3839.44s)]
*  I mean, I'm obviously not of the Jewish face or the tradition [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3844.0s)]
*  I wasn't able to draw from kind of the history you draw from in the book, but it did feel very [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3846.84s)]
*  American it felt like [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3851.7599999999998s)]
*  The kind of fear and the the victimization was not all that different from how a lot of us felt after 9-eleven [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3854.0800000000004s)]
*  And the response was we wanted to see someone punished. We wanted to feel safe again and any conversation about [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3862.1600000000003s)]
*  Susan Sontag and the New Yorker about why al-qaeda might have attacked us. She was basically run out of the country [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3869.88s)]
*  Any concern about civilian casualties was dismissed? [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3875.32s)]
*  I don't know. I wonder if you're maybe being too hard on yourself [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3879.1600000000003s)]
*  Well, I think the point you're making is so important right I mean like we have to be able to make a distinction between [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3882.4399999999996s)]
*  Justifying and explaining right because if you can't if you can't explain you can't respond in a in a smart and thoughtful way [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3888.0s)]
*  For your own safety not to mention the safety of other people, right? [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3896.6s)]
*  So America America's response to 9-eleven we didn't have the right kind of conversation about why that happened [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3899.64s)]
*  Yes, we know we said it was evil. Yes. It was evil. We said bin Laden was was evil. Yes, that's true [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3905.7999999999997s)]
*  but we didn't actually have enough of a conversation about the fact that that that [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3911.56s)]
*  America's policies in the Middle East were producing a tremendous amount of hatred [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3916.16s)]
*  And so America had needed to deal with some of those questions [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3920.4s)]
*  Right even as we had the right to go and try to go after al-qaeda [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3924.28s)]
*  And I think I see a parallel after October 7th [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3927.84s)]
*  Yes [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3930.32s)]
*  The the attacks on civilians were fundamentally wrong under any moral system that I can imagine in the abduction of innocent people, right? [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3930.8s)]
*  But if you don't talk about what life was like in Gaza on October 6, you're not you can't understand October 7th [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3937.68s)]
*  And if you do try to talk about it without October 6, the message you end up sending is that Palestinians are just barbarians [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3945.52s)]
*  That's just kind of like what they do like to do for fun, right? And in reality [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3951.2799999999997s)]
*  Gaza was considered an open-air prison by Human Rights Watch [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3956.3599999999997s)]
*  I quote in the book my friend Mohammed Shahada a brilliant Palestinian writer born in Gaza [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3959.16s)]
*  He says everyone he knew who grew up in gotten in Gaza [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3963.52s)]
*  Contemplated suicide because there was absolutely no hope of actually living an adult life with any opportunity [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3966.76s)]
*  And those are not if you don't deal with those underlying conditions, you're not gonna keep Israeli safe. I wonder [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3973.72s)]
*  Maybe one of the you know people we argue with might get to the point where they say, okay [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3979.56s)]
*  It has been long enough. I can now kind of finally tap the level of empathy [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3984.0s)]
*  You're tapping and I hear you and on a mental level. I understand what you're saying [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3988.88s)]
*  But what would you have done differently, you know, you get that a lot, right? Okay [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3994.24s)]
*  What should Netanyahu or the government have done in a perfect world? [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=3997.52s)]
*  Do you have a good answer to that when people press you the answer starts with recognizing that the Palestinians are a political problem [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4001.0s)]
*  They're not a military problem and they're a political problem because you are holding millions of people under your control without basic rights [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4007.8799999999997s)]
*  And if you want those people to stop attacking you violently [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4015.2799999999997s)]
*  You have to create paths in which they can see a path towards their freedom [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4019.08s)]
*  And and if you don't you're never gonna actually deal with a problem [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4024.38s)]
*  The war has destroyed Gaza utterly but you know who's still there Hamas is still there, right? [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4028.66s)]
*  And if you even got rid of Hamas, you would get some other group that would attack you because when you kill [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4033.54s)]
*  Tens of thousands of people a lot of people are gonna be really angry and want to fight you [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4038.42s)]
*  So what would I have done? I would have I would have let Marwan Barghouti out of jail [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4042.06s)]
*  He's the most popular Palestinian leader. He's spoken about justice and reconciliation in the tradition of Nelson Mandela. He's not an Islamist [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4045.96s)]
*  He's a lot more popular than Hamas. Let him out of jail. Stop settlement growth. Stop removing settlements from deep in Gaza [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4053.02s)]
*  Stop start removing the check allow Palestinians to have some basic dignity say you support either a Palestinian state [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4059.62s)]
*  Along the 1967 lines or if not that that you support giving Palestinian citizenship in Israel [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4066.9s)]
*  Give people a vision of their freedom and I try to argue in the book that you can see over the last 30 years [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4072.38s)]
*  The Palestinian attitudes about violence against Israelis go up and they go down the more the more hopeful Palestinians are about [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4077.9s)]
*  About their freedom the less supportive they are armed attacks. Yeah, I want to dig into some of that data [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4086.06s)]
*  I mean in the book you write about net and Yahoo come into power in 1996 by explicitly running against the Oslo Accords [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4090.94s)]
*  Which for those who don't know where they have the beginning of a peace process that was designed to bring about a two-state solution [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4098.74s)]
*  Net and Yahoo then accelerate settlements in the West Bank [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4104.219999999999s)]
*  extremists on both sides take a bunch of horrific actions that disrupt the process and it blows up but you note that how [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4107.66s)]
*  during BB's first tenure [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4114.46s)]
*  Polling that show there was polling that showed Palestinian support for violence against Israelis went from 18% in the fall of 1995 [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4116.9s)]
*  to 50% [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4123.74s)]
*  At the end of that Yahoo's tenure. I'm not sure what data was 96 97 99 when he's finally defeated by Baraka [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4125.5s)]
*  What does that tell us? I mean you that I think the data is pretty clear there [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4131.46s)]
*  Yeah, what it tells us is something, you know, really basic [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4135.38s)]
*  I think which is that most people don't want to kill anybody and they don't want to be killed themselves, right? [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4138.86s)]
*  They don't want to be in a war, right? [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4144.14s)]
*  They would much prefer if there was a nonviolent path to them being able to live a decent life and you can't live a decent [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4145.66s)]
*  Life without basic freedoms, right? [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4152.06s)]
*  And so in the early years of the Oslo court where Palestinians thought that they were on their way to statehood [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4153.86s)]
*  There was a lot of support for Oslo and not very much support for attacks on on Israelis [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4158.9s)]
*  There were attacks on Israelis by Hamas because Hamas was trying to undermine the Oslo accords [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4164.099999999999s)]
*  Which they had never agreed to but most Palestinians opposed those violent attacks and when Netanyahu comes to power and [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4169.42s)]
*  He exact increases settlement growth and he basically says essentially we're not really going to withdraw from any more territory right anymore [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4177.66s)]
*  Palestinians begin to feel this whole thing is a fraud and so it makes them much it makes them more willing to support [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4184.3s)]
*  The the violent attacks that continue and then and then escalate into the second intifada [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4190.7s)]
*  It also just hammers home to me. What a horrible force Netanyahu has been throughout his career in history [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4195.34s)]
*  You know, I mean it's just you have to wonder on earth too [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4201.62s)]
*  If he is not around if he doesn't come to power what things might look like [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4204.62s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's exactly right [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4208.46s)]
*  But I also think the United States has been Benjamin Netanyahu's secret weapon [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4210.26s)]
*  No doubt the reason that America's been because his political opponents going back to the 90s his centrist opponents like Eheba rock and say believe me [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4214.7s)]
*  You're always saying we can't get away with this if we don't support a Palestinian state if we continue to do settlement growth and make [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4220.900000000001s)]
*  A Palestinian state impossible. It's gonna undermine our relationships with the United States and Netanyahu said don't worry about it [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4227.18s)]
*  It's gonna be fine. The Americans will stick with us no matter what and we proved him, right? [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4232.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, we he had us in the palm of his hand from Biden to Trump to everybody in between [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4236.7s)]
*  Not Obama. We we didn't like that guy [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4242.78s)]
*  What like what what is I think kind of remarkable about the book and the conversation we're having right now [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4249.86s)]
*  I don't think it would really happen most places in DC. I imagine this the tenor of our conversation would be unwelcome [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4254.78s)]
*  And a lot of places that would normally want foreign policy talks or book talks [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4262.679999999999s)]
*  About important issues, but you know you have experienced I think firsthand more than most people how [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4268.0s)]
*  these issues around [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4275.599999999999s)]
*  The Middle East peace process or a Palestinian state or Gaza or Palestinian rights get policed online [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4277.92s)]
*  and policed by groups like the ADL [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4283.72s)]
*  And how you can see someone like Elon Musk get a pass for doing something that looks very much like a Nazi salute [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4286.68s)]
*  I don't know what he was doing, but it certainly looks like it including a pastor from Netanyahu himself while also being very aware that any [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4292.76s)]
*  Liberal or leftist critic of Israel would not get the same grace if they had done the same thing [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4300.56s)]
*  Even if it was completely by accident, can you just talk about like your experience of that? [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4308.2s)]
*  Speech policing the groups involved etc. It's so upsetting to me [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4312.84s)]
*  you know [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4317.16s)]
*  there's a reason that people are afraid of being called anti-semitic because because a tremendous amount of [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4317.8s)]
*  Terror of horror has been committed in the name of anti-semitism [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4323.32s)]
*  And so I'm glad that people are scared about being called anti-semitic [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4326.32s)]
*  But the the flip side of that is that if you are a Jewish leader [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4330.62s)]
*  Who has this power in your hands to deploy this term? [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4334.36s)]
*  The term is sacred you have to treat it with reverence and respect, you know, Jonathan Greenblatt of the ADL [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4338.28s)]
*  It wasn't him who suffered the the horrifying state-sponsored anti-semitism of the Nazi period or other [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4344.12s)]
*  These were previous generations of Jews [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4349.76s)]
*  You're trading on their suffering to try to scare people out of having completely legitimate debates about what Israel is doing [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4351.72s)]
*  You you because you don't have any good arguments [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4360.5199999999995s)]
*  So the only way you can win these arguments is to scare [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4363.92s)]
*  Intimidate people into not saying what they really feel that to me is a desecration of [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4366.96s)]
*  the experience of Jewish suffering and it's it's a it's a violation of of the of the [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4372.52s)]
*  Respect that we should treat people with if you have an argument [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4378.2s)]
*  Come to the table and make the argument and people should be could just people should be considered innocent of being anti-semites until proven guilty [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4382.2s)]
*  Not the way around besides it's just utterly Orwellian to say that someone who believes in equality [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4389.759999999999s)]
*  Between Palestinians and Jews is a bigot bigotry is the opposite of equality bigotry is wrong because it denies human equality [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4396.2s)]
*  Right. So how can the ADL pretend to be an organization that's genuinely anti bigotry when basically what they're trying to do is [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4403.62s)]
*  Is to protect a system of fundamental human inequality. It makes it's just completely Orwellian in my view [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4411.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's also look I mean I think anyone who's aware of the history of the Holocaust or the treatment of Jewish people [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4417.44s)]
*  for centuries like know the power of that word and what it symbolizes beyond just [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4424.0s)]
*  Language but cruelty and violence and murder and you know and like I'm a pretty [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4431.12s)]
*  I'm a kid of the child of the internet, you know, but on Twitter a long time [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4436.5599999999995s)]
*  I feel like I have a thick skin sometimes but it be getting called [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4439.76s)]
*  Antisemitic or having someone assume that's what drives your beliefs like that really hurts, you know, like bye for me personally [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4444.8s)]
*  My wife's Jewish my daughter goes to a Jewish preschool. I when I drop her off [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4450.64s)]
*  There's like six layers of armed security because of threats. It's like something I take very [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4454.599999999999s)]
*  Seriously and worry about in my own life and even you know talking about this worries me because I'm like [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4460.84s)]
*  I don't know what if someone who hates me decided to you know, do something shitty to my family, but you're right [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4466.24s)]
*  I mean this word just gets it's wielded like a cudgel [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4472.38s)]
*  But while also Netanyahu kind of gives like get out of jail free cards [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4474.9800000000005s)]
*  Right and that right and that's what I think the American media often doesn't understand [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4480.18s)]
*  They don't understand why there can be people who love Israel, but really don't like the Jews in their own countries, right? [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4483.7s)]
*  But you see that all over the place, right? [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4490.26s)]
*  You see all these and it's not that hard to understand which is that these people are ethno-nationalists, right? [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4492.26s)]
*  So they basically like countries that are run by one tribe that in which has like legal supremacy [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4497.78s)]
*  And so they think Israel is great. They actually want America to be more like Israel [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4503.54s)]
*  They're like great. They're different one set of laws for one group of people another set of laws for another [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4506.82s)]
*  They have an immigration policy that only lets in people who are like them. That's awesome, right? [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4511.0599999999995s)]
*  But they don't like Jews in America because you know, we don't want that in America, right? [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4515.46s)]
*  We don't want America to be a white Christian state [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4519.86s)]
*  We want equality under the law and are and the problem is that we're not applying that same set of principles about a belief [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4522.54s)]
*  Inequality under the law that states that treat everybody equally [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4529.66s)]
*  We're making an exception for Israel and then we find to our horror that people like Victor Orban and Marine Le Pen [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4532.34s)]
*  And and if I must want to make an exception for America too, right which puts us in danger [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4538.42s)]
*  Yeah, and if you read the history of the foundation of Israel, I mean, there's a great book [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4543.06s)]
*  I believe it's called my American Israel by Amy Goodman [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4547.1s)]
*  Yes, professor at Penn or something she reissued now actually [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4550.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4553.62s)]
*  She talked about how some of the like, you know founding Zionists were actually wildly anti-semitic [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4553.78s)]
*  Because they thought it was an opportunity to send Jews from their country to someplace else [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4557.98s)]
*  That's exactly if you don't want Jews in around where you are [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4562.0199999999995s)]
*  What better opportunity than to basically have them go so they have their own country. Yeah [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4565.28s)]
*  So getting back to today, I mean I was a pretty harsh critic of Biden's Gaza policy you were too [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4569.66s)]
*  I asked but I never kind of joined in the chorus of people who [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4574.86s)]
*  You know [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4580.299999999999s)]
*  We're attacking Muslim Americans or Arab Americans who said they couldn't vote for Kamala Harris or couldn't support Joe Biden [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4580.86s)]
*  Because of that policy even though I kind of worried in my in my heart of hearts that Trump would be worse [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4586.94s)]
*  Ultimately, um, I give him a lot of credit for helping get this ceasefire deal over the finish line [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4593.54s)]
*  But at the same time Trump just turned back on the shipment of 2,000 pound bombs to Israel here move sanctions on violent settlers [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4598.459999999999s)]
*  He's openly talking about ethnic cleansing of the Gaza Strip [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4605.0599999999995s)]
*  What are you watching for in terms of Trump's policy and I don't know what are you expecting? [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4609.34s)]
*  I mean, I this is kind of what I feared right? [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4615.42s)]
*  I mean Trump liked the hostage deal because it makes him look good, right? [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4618.58s)]
*  Which is you know the most important thing for him, right? [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4622.0599999999995s)]
*  And he may not get America into war with Iran because he may recognize that Americans don't want wars, which is good [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4624.179999999999s)]
*  Right, but he it's it's hard to overstate how little of a shit he gives about Palestinian life, right? [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4629.54s)]
*  I mean they meet matter it matters less than nothing to him right nor international law any of this stuff [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4636.3s)]
*  So what he said now about the fact that they should all go to Egypt or Jordan is utterly monstrous [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4641.7s)]
*  I mean, it's just utterly monstrous. Like let's step back, right? These people are refugees [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4648.18s)]
*  Most of their families are refugees from Israel. They were expelled in 1948 [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4652.74s)]
*  They lived in this area called which was Human Rights Watch called an open-air prison [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4656.820000000001s)]
*  UN called it unlivable before October 7th now [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4660.02s)]
*  It's been completely destroyed with American weapons. And so your response is not huh? [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4662.62s)]
*  Maybe we should stop sending those weapons to basically destroy this place [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4667.42s)]
*  Maybe we should deal with the fact that they lack freedom. Maybe we should allow them to rebuild [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4670.9s)]
*  Maybe we should even allow them to go back to the places their families are from instead. He's like, oh wow [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4674.7s)]
*  Looks like it really sucks there [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4679.26s)]
*  I guess basically we should clean the place out make them go somewhere else, right? [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4680.86s)]
*  And there's no reason at all to believe they would ever be allowed to return, right? [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4685.0199999999995s)]
*  So then he's doing the bidding of Smotrich and Bengevin [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4688.46s)]
*  So Smotrich and Bengevin are gonna move into the Trump hotel when they bring settlers into Gaza like this is monstrous [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4691.3s)]
*  I hope one day that I'm lucky enough to see Donald Trump have to answer for this in front of the International Criminal Court [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4696.9400000000005s)]
*  By the way, this is kind of like the Jared Kushner plan that he floated at Harvard last year [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4702.22s)]
*  Like clear it out build some condos. Yeah, these people care more honestly fucking about condominiums than they care about human life [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4705.82s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, they do [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4712.82s)]
*  Well, it's hard to feel any hope here [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4714.9800000000005s)]
*  I don't say like Gaza [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4717.98s)]
*  It's a it's a generational reconstruction project in Gaza if it gets funded if it happens if we get to [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4719.74s)]
*  Phase two and three of this ceasefire deal. Hopefully we will [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4725.66s)]
*  I think if history is a guide as you talk about in the book Hamas [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4728.62s)]
*  Tends to recruit from the the family members of those killed [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4732.66s)]
*  There's gonna be lots and lots of opportunity there [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4737.139999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu is still in power Trump stacked his administration full of people that believe in annexation of the West Bank [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4740.379999999999s)]
*  Congress and its infinite wisdom now wants to sanction the fucking International Criminal Court let alone, you know not and go after Netanyahu [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4746.259999999999s)]
*  It makes me feel [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4754.339999999999s)]
*  Naive forever kind of like espousing the two-state solution as the answer [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4756.46s)]
*  But I don't know man. I just feel very hopeless like where where do we go from here? Well, look I think [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4761.66s)]
*  That you know do what I think what do I think is most likely? [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4767.62s)]
*  Honestly, what I think is most likely and it's not gonna happen tomorrow [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4770.66s)]
*  But I think most likely the most likely things can happen is that there's gonna be what I would call an American style [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4773.58s)]
*  Solution to the Palestinian question by which I mean the 19th century American solution to art to the Native American problem [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4777.9s)]
*  Which was basically we destroyed that population. So it couldn't be a political threat anymore, right? [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4783.78s)]
*  And I think that given the impunity Israel has in the world today [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4788.26s)]
*  That's the direction that things are going and it's it's monstrous to watch something that we thought could only happen in the 19th century [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4792.18s)]
*  Or the previous centuries happening in our time [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4797.9s)]
*  But we have to resist it with all everything we have even though we might not succeed and what gives me hope is that there [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4800.9s)]
*  Is a movement that's growing for Palestinian freedom now. It's not perfect. I don't like all the chance [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4807.339999999999s)]
*  I can there are certain things that sometimes there can be a dehumanization [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4812.259999999999s)]
*  Dehumanization of Israelis that's true [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4816.219999999999s)]
*  But you know what they were really stupid fucking champs during the anti-vietnam war movement too, right? [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4817.46s)]
*  And there were communists in the civil rights movement who defended Joseph Stalin [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4821.62s)]
*  But the basic principle which is about human freedom and human equality [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4824.98s)]
*  This is this is really really important and this movement is bringing as you know [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4829.139999999999s)]
*  It's bringing a lot of Jews into it a lot of young Jews [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4833.66s)]
*  People from all different walks of life and maybe that movement can do what the other great movements in the 20th century did the anti-apartheid [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4836.38s)]
*  Movement the civil rights movement the movement against Soviet domination from Eastern Europe [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4842.58s)]
*  Maybe it can make the impossible possible and and and create freedom for Palestinians [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4846.139999999999s)]
*  I mean, I don't want to put more kind of responsibility on activists than other people do in governments [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4850.5599999999995s)]
*  but you know you write in the book about how [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4855.8s)]
*  In the early days of after October 7th [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4858.66s)]
*  You're kind of scouring anti-war speeches for whether people would condemn what had happened [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4860.98s)]
*  And I remember kind of doing the same thing and seeing tweets from I'm not gonna name names [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4866.5s)]
*  But you know very like senior Washington Post reporters who had written books and were people [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4871.26s)]
*  I was impressed by didn't know and respected who are like, you know [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4878.18s)]
*  I'll reserve judgment on the morality of what happened today and maybe this person maybe the charitable reason explanation is this person [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4881.66s)]
*  Didn't have all the information about the horrors and the evils inflicted on [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4888.66s)]
*  Civilians and children and women that day, but it was fucking gross and kind of morally bankrupt [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4894.34s)]
*  and I feel like the inability for people to kind of [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4900.46s)]
*  Just draw the line at like targeting and killing civilians was upsetting [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4903.7s)]
*  So, I don't know. What would you say to people who look who feel like I know they're more in our camp than [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4907.82s)]
*  Kind of the DC blobs version of what they'd like to see happen here [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4913.18s)]
*  They want to see Palestinian liberation [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4916.56s)]
*  But they're worried by some of those chants and turned off by kind of some of the rhetoric you hear that does feel [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4918.040000000001s)]
*  anti-semitic not just anti-zionist but kind of I don't know does diminish and [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4924.64s)]
*  You know push away Jewish suffering after October 7th. Yeah, and I I you know [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4929.4400000000005s)]
*  I also find that really really difficult upsetting to swallow [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4935.72s)]
*  But I think we need to also we need to remember that [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4939.240000000001s)]
*  Movements that we can't we shouldn't sanitize the movements of the past which is to say just because people are victims and oppressed [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4943.28s)]
*  It doesn't make them or their allies [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4950.16s)]
*  Pure people can still say and do [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4952.44s)]
*  Stupid and even kind of even dehumanizing things, you know people like don't forget [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4955.36s)]
*  You know that the African National Congress's main main main arrival was the Pan-Africanist Congress [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4959.799999999999s)]
*  There it chant informal slogan was one settler one bullet, right? [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4964.5199999999995s)]
*  You know, but it didn't mean that black South Africans didn't have the right to be free and in fact the the in reality [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4968.44s)]
*  Ultimately ended up everyone being ended up being a lot more safe once once black South Africans got their freedom [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4975.5199999999995s)]
*  So I'm not saying we shouldn't we shouldn't care about this [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4980.599999999999s)]
*  We should we should care about it and it's we should call people out if they dehumanize Israelis [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4983.0s)]
*  Absolutely, but we shouldn't allow that to be an excuse for saying that it's okay to hold [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4988.12s)]
*  Palestinians under conditions that even Israel's own human rights organizations are calling apartheid. Yeah [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4993.839999999999s)]
*  Well, listen here the book is called being Jewish after the destruction of Gaza. It's an excellent book [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifmRdGkOPGE&t=4999.04s)]
