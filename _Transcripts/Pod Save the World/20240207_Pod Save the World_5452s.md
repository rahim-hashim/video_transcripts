Video Description: Tommy Vietor and Ben Rhodes talk about US strikes against facilities in Iraq and Syria used by Iran-backed militia groups, White House denials that the conflict in Gaza has drawn America into a regional war, haunting statistics for children in Gaza, souring public opinion on the war, and dehumanizing commentary about the Middle East. They also discuss how Biden’s foreign policy agenda is being held up by Congress, Zelensky’s potential government and military shake-up, Tucker Carlson’s interview with Vladimir Putin, El Salvador’s election and Bukele’s rising popularity, polling in Europe that forecasts momentum for far right parties, a historic first in Northern Ireland, King Charles’ cancer diagnosis, Rishi Sunak’s insane fasting regimen, and Liz Truss’ plans to attend CPAC. Then Tommy speaks to Alex Ward, national security reporter at Politico about his new book “The Internationalists”.

# Why is Tucker Carlson Interviewing Vladimir Putin? | Pod Save The World
**Pod Save the World:** [February 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI)
*  Welcome to Pods Day of the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Ben Rhodes. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2.0s)]
*  Ben, I did a cable TV hit the other day. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  Chris Hayes, MSNBC. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5.72s)]
*  Welcome to my world, Tommy. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=6.96s)]
*  It was fun. I really like Chris. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=8.08s)]
*  I like his show a lot. He's very smart and they cover foreign policy. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=9.84s)]
*  But he reminded me how in the before times, before Trump, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=12.8s)]
*  when there was a crisis in the world and a presidential campaign was happening, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=17.36s)]
*  advisors to the campaign would do conference calls and put out policy papers. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=21.68s)]
*  And the advisors were like policy people and not like Magalina. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  No, it would be like Dennis McDonough was a campaign advisor, became White House chief of staff. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=29.68s)]
*  Susan Rice was the campaign advisor, became the national security advisor. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=33.68s)]
*  And then with the Trump team, they just made no comments on everything in the world. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=36.64s)]
*  Well, nice work. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=41.2s)]
*  It was a nice trip down memory lane of us in the 2008 campaign having to react to [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=42.32s)]
*  Putin invading the country of Georgia. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  Yeah, I remember that. Everybody forgets that they invaded Georgia in 2008. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=48.88s)]
*  But and Bush did nothing, actually. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=52.72s)]
*  Bush did nothing. And McCain was like, why are we not there for Saqashvili? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=55.36s)]
*  And then Chris was what? A nation reporter. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=58.72s)]
*  Is it the nation? Yeah, that's a long time ago. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=63.12s)]
*  Long time ago. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=65.28s)]
*  Children, young people. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=66.08s)]
*  The before times. It was a better time, though, when candidates had to say what they would do [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=67.12s)]
*  and how they would lead the world. It seems like a better idea. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=71.12s)]
*  Anyway, we're going to do exactly that today. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=74.08s)]
*  We're going to cover the US airstrikes on militia groups supported by Iran, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=76.24s)]
*  the latest from Gaza and the dramatic shift against the Israeli war effort in the United States. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=80.0s)]
*  We're also going to talk about the fate of Biden's foreign policy agenda and how it's tied up [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=84.72s)]
*  in the US Senate and with immigration reform. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=88.4s)]
*  We will also cover some a big shake up in the Ukrainian government. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=91.04s)]
*  Tucker Carlson took a little sojourn to Russia. Good for him. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=94.4s)]
*  Hope he's trying some. Yeah, it's a good weather this [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=99.44000000000001s)]
*  caviar or something. I don't know what you do over there. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  We're also going to talk about elections, a future democracy in El Salvador, Europe, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=103.92s)]
*  Pakistan and Senegal, and then a little on Northern Ireland and some sad news about King Charles. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=106.88000000000001s)]
*  And finally, a little segment called British conservatives are weird. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=111.84s)]
*  Well, that's been kind of a standing segment on the show. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  We can brand it now. That's true. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=118.56s)]
*  That's very true. This is non Boris Johnson. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=119.92s)]
*  And then you're going to hear my interview with Politico's Alex Ward about his new book, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=122.48s)]
*  The Internationalist, which covers President Biden's foreign policy over the first two years [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=125.6s)]
*  of his administration. Stick around for that first Biden book. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=129.84s)]
*  Year three is quite the sequel. Yeah, things big shake up. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=132.56s)]
*  What's it? Yeah, there's that part of a screenplay. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=136.48s)]
*  It's like the dark period. I know what it's called. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=138.88s)]
*  Dark Night of the Soul, something like that. It didn't save the cat. Read the fucking book. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=142.88s)]
*  But Ben, should we talk about Iran? We should. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  All right. So as expected on February 2nd, last Friday, the US bombed seven facilities in Iraq [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=149.68s)]
*  and Syria that are used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and militant groups [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=156.4s)]
*  supported by Iran. These airstrikes were in response to a drone attack on a US base in [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=160.8s)]
*  Jordan in late January. They killed three US service members and wounded 30 more. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=164.8s)]
*  The drone strike in Jordan was one of more than 160 attacks since mid October on US troops in Iraq [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=168.96s)]
*  and Syria by these militant groups with links to Iran. Here's a clip of Jake Sullivan, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=175.44s)]
*  Biden's national security adviser, talking about those strikes on Face the Nation over the weekend. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=179.92s)]
*  What happened on Friday was the beginning, not the end of our response, and that there will be more [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=184.56s)]
*  steps, some seen, some perhaps unseen, all in an effort to send a very clear message that when [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=188.72s)]
*  American forces are attacked, when Americans are killed, as three service members tragically were [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=194.72s)]
*  at tower 22, we will respond and we will respond forcefully and we will respond in a sustained way. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=201.52s)]
*  I would not describe it as some open-ended military campaign. We have a concept of how [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  we intend to respond. I'm not going to telegraph it on this show, but we will execute that concept [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  with the kind of professionalism that only the US military can bring to bear. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=217.52s)]
*  So I guess based on that, we should expect maybe some further airstrikes or like cyber operations [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=221.28s)]
*  or sanctions to come. I don't know. It will take some time to see if this initial set of [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=226.4s)]
*  strikes were successful and these groups were deterred. CNN reported that one main Iran-linked [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=230.56s)]
*  militia group, Qatay-Pezbollah, or KH, announced the suspension of its military operations against [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=236.88s)]
*  US troops in Iraq in order to prevent the embarrassment of the Iraqi government. That [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=242.8s)]
*  was their rationale. We'll see if that holds. But on Sunday, there was a drone attack on a base [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=246.72s)]
*  housing US forces in Syria that killed six Kurdish fighters and the Houthi rebels in Yemen just [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=251.12s)]
*  continued to fire missiles at ships in the Red Sea all day every day. Ben, I was relieved to [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=256.16s)]
*  hear that Biden didn't consider attacks in Iran proper and went with this more limited option, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=261.20000000000005s)]
*  but also a little troubling or worrisome to hear Jake Sullivan say there's no back channel [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=266.64000000000004s)]
*  conversations happening between the US and Iran about de-escalation, although maybe there's [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=270.64000000000004s)]
*  indirect conversations through Oman or something happening, or you just didn't want to comment. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=275.28000000000003s)]
*  But what did you make of what Biden chose in terms of this response? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=279.76000000000005s)]
*  Ben Sholz I think in terms of what they chose, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=284.08s)]
*  it's pretty clear that they were looking and we joked, I mean, not that I think this is funny, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  but we made reference last week to when you get three options and you choose the middle option. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=292.0s)]
*  And this is the middle option in the sense that if option one was kind of not having a military [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=297.28s)]
*  response that is escalatory and then option three was striking IRGC targets, Iranian Revolutionary [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=302.32s)]
*  Guard targets inside of Iran, they chose an option where they went after these proxy groups [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=309.6s)]
*  and will probably continue to go after these groups in Iraq and Syria and Yemen. And so that [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=314.96000000000004s)]
*  sees militias have been active for a long time in Iraq and Syria and the Houthis in Yemen, but not [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=320.24s)]
*  going into Iran. And the perhaps unseen comment that Jake said seems to be a reference to cyber, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  offensive cyber, which we don't talk about, the US government doesn't talk about, but I assume [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=334.64000000000004s)]
*  that means there might be some offensive cyber operations against the Iranian. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=339.36s)]
*  Trey Lockerbie We're going to sign the Iranians up with [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=343.76s)]
*  like a D triple C disrealist. Ben Sholz [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=345.44s)]
*  One of those kind of strange text messages. Trey Lockerbie [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=348.15999999999997s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries or something. No bad ideas in a brainstorm. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=350.0s)]
*  Ben Sholz So that's what they're doing. And I'd expect [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=353.76s)]
*  you know, a few more airstrikes on that network of, you know, what is called the Axis of Resistance, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=358.47999999999996s)]
*  these Iranian backed groups. We talked last week about the fact that Iran doesn't necessarily pick [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=365.68s)]
*  targets or control these groups. In terms of deterrence, you made this point about the Houthis [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=369.92s)]
*  already attacking, shipping in the Red Sea, even after these strikes and some attacks on Syria. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=377.52000000000004s)]
*  What I'd say about this is these groups have been operating in war zones for many, many years, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=384.8s)]
*  right? The groups in Iraq and Syria, you know, the groups in Iraq goes all the way back to the [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=390.16s)]
*  height of the Iraq war. Trey Lockerbie [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=396.64000000000004s)]
*  And mostly just want us out of Iraq. Ben Sholz [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=397.6s)]
*  Yeah, the groups in Syria withstood the decade long civil, Syrians of war. So they're not going [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=398.88000000000005s)]
*  to be deterred. They're not going to go out of business. They're not going to say, you know, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=405.28000000000003s)]
*  we give up. You might degrade their capabilities, you might have them shift tactics, but fundamentally, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=408.16s)]
*  the challenge here is there's not going to be some clear moment in which we can announce the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=415.12s)]
*  restoration of deterrence because that's not how these groups work. Their ethos is to be [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=420.08s)]
*  in confrontation with the United States, in confrontation with Israel, with the dial turned [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=425.36s)]
*  up because of what's happening in Gaza, they're going to continue to do that. But maybe you make [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=430.24s)]
*  it a little harder for them to do that by doing these strikes. But I don't think you're going to [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=434.32s)]
*  solve the fundamental issue, which is there's an escalation in Gaza and these groups are participating [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=438.56s)]
*  in that escalation. I think that the KH, the Qatab Hezbollah announcement is about wanting [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=443.2s)]
*  to make the US the bad guy in terms of Iraqi sovereignty. Ben Sholz [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=451.76s)]
*  Yeah, because I think they did it before we responded to these airstrikes. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=456.56s)]
*  Ben Sholz They did before. And I think what they're trying to do is they want the Iraqi [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=459.2s)]
*  government to feel embarrassed by the US violating their sovereignty by taking airstrikes in Iraq [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=462.56s)]
*  and say, see, like, we're not trying to escalate here. Because what they ultimately want is the [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=468.0s)]
*  Iraqi government to ask the US to leave. And there's about 2500 US troops there. And there [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=471.76s)]
*  was a bit of a dust up. You know, I were texting about this, Tommy, like, the US government [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=476.24s)]
*  didn't apparently pre notify the Iraqi government these strikes. And that's the dynamic that KH is [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=480.56s)]
*  trying to play into. So I don't know, I continue to feel like we are on a ladder of escalation. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=486.96s)]
*  I'm glad that they put some limits on that in terms of not going into Iran. But I also, it's [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=493.59999999999997s)]
*  continues to just be the case that unless and until there's a ceasefire in Gaza, I don't know [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=499.04s)]
*  how you have a true restoration of some degree of calm in the region. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=504.0s)]
*  Tom Bilyeu Yeah, and it's interesting, I think, to your point, Jake's language sort of shift from [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=508.64s)]
*  one about deterrence to just degrading the capabilities of these militia groups, because [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=512.64s)]
*  you're right, you can like blow up some of their missiles, but they're gonna get more. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=515.92s)]
*  The Washington Post reported that the drone that killed the US service members in Jordan [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=518.64s)]
*  went undetected because it flew at low altitude. And there were no air defense systems on the site [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=523.04s)]
*  capable of shooting it down. That is different from the initial reports that we talked about [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=527.52s)]
*  last week that maybe this enemy drone came in as a US drone was landing confused everybody and was [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=531.4399999999999s)]
*  able to hit the target. But I guess this base didn't have weapons that could kill the drones, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=537.6s)]
*  they just have electronic warfare defenses, sort of, you know, fry their electronics and take them [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=541.68s)]
*  out. That's bad. And that's insane to me that, you know, give a forward deployed base like this, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=546.0s)]
*  and not have sufficient air defenses. But to this broader point, then of whether, you know, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=552.0s)]
*  the ways this conflict is spilling out into the region. Here's another clip from Jake Sullivan. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=557.52s)]
*  He was on CNN State of the Union, he did a round of Sunday shows this weekend. The question was [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=562.3199999999999s)]
*  from Dana Bash. She basically said, you say you want to avoid a broader regional war, but aren't [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=566.96s)]
*  we already in one? We're hitting targets in all these different countries, etc, etc. Here's a clip. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=571.36s)]
*  These are distinct but related challenges. For example, what's happening in the Red Sea is [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=575.84s)]
*  obviously, to a certain extent, triggered by what's happening in Gaza, but it's not the same thing. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=581.28s)]
*  The Houthis aren't just hitting ships related to Israel, they're hitting a lot of different ships [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=586.9599999999999s)]
*  from a lot of different countries. And so we are trying to deal with the challenge to freedom of [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=592.24s)]
*  navigation in the Red Sea. That is a distinct challenge. The forces and the militia groups [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=596.72s)]
*  in Iraq and Syria are hitting our forces, we're responding. And then of course, Israel is dealing [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=601.28s)]
*  both with the challenge of Hamas and Gaza and the threat from Hezbollah in the north. So we will [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=606.48s)]
*  continue to work to deal with the challenge of escalation and continue to work to ensure we're [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=611.9200000000001s)]
*  responding forcefully, but at the same time, staying out of the prospect of the United States [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=618.32s)]
*  getting pulled into a broad war in the Middle East of the kind that we have seen in the past. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=624.32s)]
*  So Ben, as Aliviah said to me last week, a ceasefire won't guarantee that Iranian-linked [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=628.8000000000001s)]
*  militia groups stop these attacks, but not brokering a ceasefire almost certainly guarantees that they [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=635.12s)]
*  continue. It is a little worrisome that like the core point that I think most people seem to agree [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=641.28s)]
*  on that Gaza is the driver of this uptick in violence is not echoed by top administration [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=648.3199999999999s)]
*  officials. Yeah, because it's not a matter of opinion. It's just a matter of fact that since [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=654.8s)]
*  October 7th, and then the Israeli military response, we have seen the Houthi attacks on [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=665.04s)]
*  shipping in the Red Sea and an uptick in these attacks on the US forces. That's just the reality. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=670.32s)]
*  It's like Pentagon data. That's just what happened. So we've seen violence, acts of violence [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=674.4000000000001s)]
*  in Gaza and the West Bank, in Israel, in Lebanon, in Syria, in Iraq, in Yemen, all go up since [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=681.2800000000001s)]
*  October 7th. And so by definition, this is connected and this is part of a regional war [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=692.4000000000001s)]
*  and the hottest part of that war is in Gaza and the scale the Israeli military operation has been [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=699.12s)]
*  followed by an uptick in the scale of action by these groups. That's just what's happening. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=706.72s)]
*  And so to be an option one person, sometimes people, I did a cable appearance Tommy to continue [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=712.48s)]
*  that theme where someone said, well, isn't it the case that we have to, do we have to respond [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=722.48s)]
*  militarily to what happened at tower 22? And we don't, I mean, there's not some mandates, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=727.6s)]
*  we have to bomb things. The reality is, I believe ultimately the thing that will best secure [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=735.28s)]
*  US forces in the region, if that's the objective, is number one, to have a ceasefire and a [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=744.4s)]
*  deescalation tensions across the region. And number two, by the way, to not have US forces [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=751.04s)]
*  in some of these places. As we talked about last week, I don't think that the threat of ISIS [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=755.12s)]
*  necessitates necessarily a certain number of troops in Syria, where people are vulnerable, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=761.36s)]
*  they're vulnerable to these drones. And so I just think it's important to at least [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=767.52s)]
*  make sure that we're surfacing the reality that it is an option available to the US government to [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=774.4s)]
*  say, we're going to try to double down on a diplomatic approach here. And we're also going [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=779.84s)]
*  to think about whether there's a vulnerability, because if the idea is that the one thing that [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=784.32s)]
*  we're going to do to protect US forces that are in all these disparate places in the Middle East is [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=790.4s)]
*  to essentially have more US forces in the Middle East, that's the definition of getting drawn [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=795.2800000000001s)]
*  into something. And again, I think you have to be able to articulate, where does this all end? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=799.76s)]
*  I think that the Biden administration themselves would say that they would like this to end [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=804.96s)]
*  in deescalation and in some process that could lead to a Palestinian state. And ultimately, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=809.2s)]
*  there's going to have to be some diplomatic channel to the Iranians. But how do you get there? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=814.5600000000001s)]
*  And right now, we're all about the escalation. And yes, we can talk about there's obviously these [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=820.64s)]
*  efforts of Tony Blinken's in the region, and we're trying to get a ceasefire, or at least a pause, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=826.1600000000001s)]
*  for the release of some hostages and the delivery of some aid. But otherwise, it's kind of this [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=830.32s)]
*  tenuous, tense risk of things continuing to escalate. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=836.4000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, it's just worth pointing out that in 1983, when a suicide bomber hit an [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=841.44s)]
*  American military barracks in Beirut, Reagan's response was to pull US troops out? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=846.24s)]
*  Reagan's response is, you know what, actually, I don't think these troops should be there. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=850.32s)]
*  Which is a pretty logical response. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=853.44s)]
*  And today, you'd be called cut and run, coward, whatever nonsense. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=855.84s)]
*  And that's the other thing is that I think we talked about this last week, but it bears repeating [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=858.96s)]
*  that the politics of this, there's this sense that the only politics you should be afraid of [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=862.08s)]
*  are being called weak by Lindsey Graham. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=867.12s)]
*  Neocon hawks, yeah. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=869.76s)]
*  Or having a bad day on cable news because or having even like an Obama red line kind of thing. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=871.12s)]
*  When I actually don't the politics, the bad politics are US troops being vulnerable, bad politics [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=876.88s)]
*  are 27,000 people being dead in Gaza, the bad, you know, their outcomes are ultimately going [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=881.6800000000001s)]
*  to drive the politics. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=887.04s)]
*  Yeah. So let's turn to Gaza. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=887.76s)]
*  The United Nations World Health Organization says that 100,000 people in Gaza are either dead, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=889.8399999999999s)]
*  injured or missing and presumed dead. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=895.04s)]
*  And they say that 60% of the more than 27,000 fatalities reported by Gaza's health ministry [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=897.5999999999999s)]
*  have been women and children. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=902.88s)]
*  UNICEF says that at least 17,000 kids in Gaza are unaccompanied or separated from their families [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=904.3199999999999s)]
*  and called it the most dangerous place in the world to be a child. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=910.24s)]
*  Pretty haunting statistics there. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=913.12s)]
*  About 85% of the 2.2 million people in Gaza have been displaced. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=914.96s)]
*  A huge chunk of them have been forced into refugee camps [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=919.12s)]
*  in the southern Gaza along the border. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=922.24s)]
*  The population of Ra'a, which is a city on the border of Egypt, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=924.48s)]
*  is five times what it was before the war. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=927.6s)]
*  And now Israeli authorities say they're going to expand operations into Ra'a in the coming days. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=930.08s)]
*  So that will be a catastrophe. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=934.5600000000001s)]
*  That context is the backdrop for Secretary of State Tony Blinken's fifth visit [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=937.36s)]
*  to the Middle East that's happening right now. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=942.0s)]
*  He met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Monday. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=943.76s)]
*  He's got stops in Egypt, Qatar, Israel, the West Bank. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=946.64s)]
*  More on that in a second. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=949.92s)]
*  But meanwhile, then, in Israel, the national security minister, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=951.28s)]
*  this right-wing zealot named Itamar Ben-Ghivir, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=954.8s)]
*  told the Wall Street Journal that he would oppose any ceasefire deal [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=957.28s)]
*  that would free Palestinian prisoners being held on terrorism charges [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=960.72s)]
*  or end the war before Hamas was fully defeated. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=964.08s)]
*  Remember, this is a guy who can pull his support from Netanyahu [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=966.96s)]
*  and topple the government anytime he wants. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=970.3199999999999s)]
*  So powerful lunatic, but powerful. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=972.08s)]
*  Ben-Ghivir also attacked Biden saying, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=976.0s)]
*  instead of giving us his full backing, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=978.4000000000001s)]
*  Biden is busy giving humanitarian aid and fuel to Gaza, which goes to Hamas. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=980.0s)]
*  If Trump was in power, the US conduct would be completely different. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=984.4000000000001s)]
*  So it's very clear the Israelis. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=987.44s)]
*  Yeah, a bit of a tell there. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=989.36s)]
*  Ben-Ghivir's son also tweeted that Biden has Alzheimer's. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=990.88s)]
*  So cool family. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=993.76s)]
*  There was a little good news right before we started recording. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=995.5200000000001s)]
*  All these Israeli politicians have like asshole sons. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=998.32s)]
*  Yeah, they call them the Dofen. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1001.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the Don Jr. of Israel. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1003.2800000000001s)]
*  A little good news before we started recording. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1005.9200000000001s)]
*  Qatar said they received a positive response from Hamas [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1007.44s)]
*  to the proposed ceasefire and hostage release deal. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1010.48s)]
*  I suspect it's a counter offer. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1013.36s)]
*  It will take some time to kind of work through and negotiate, but fingers crossed. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1014.72s)]
*  But Ben, stepping back, every week we come in here, the situation is worse. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1018.32s)]
*  The IDF military campaign has failed to take out Hamas's leadership, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1023.12s)]
*  failed to rescue any hostages, and yet neither the Israeli or US approach changes a bit. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1027.1200000000001s)]
*  I feel like I'm going to lose my fucking mind. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1033.44s)]
*  It's like at what point, what does it take for people to understand that none of this is working? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1035.28s)]
*  And it's time to change course. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1039.68s)]
*  They've not rescued hostages. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1040.56s)]
*  I mean, one actually, sorry, one in the opening days. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1041.8400000000001s)]
*  Okay. And meanwhile, you got a lot more out during a pause. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1044.56s)]
*  And the Ben-Ghivir comment about Hamas, whatever you, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1049.1200000000001s)]
*  we can all agree that we don't want Hamas to be running Gaza. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1053.36s)]
*  We can all agree that we don't want there to ever be another October 7th. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1056.3999999999999s)]
*  But Hamas is not going to be defeated. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1062.08s)]
*  It's, we've talked about this, but their leadership is in part out of Gaza. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1064.56s)]
*  There are many different elements of Hamas in Gaza. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1070.08s)]
*  They're not going to surrender. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1075.44s)]
*  They're not going to say, we're out of business now. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1078.56s)]
*  We're out of business now. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1081.2s)]
*  And so this constant repetition of objectives that are militarily unattainable, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1082.32s)]
*  the kind of military recovery of the hostages and the military destruction of Hamas [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1088.32s)]
*  are the articulation of unattainable objectives, which is a recipe for an open-ended war, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1093.76s)]
*  which is a recipe for the kind of catastrophic human suffering that you articulated in those [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1101.28s)]
*  statistics. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1106.24s)]
*  And the fact that this is now kind of coming to Rafa, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1107.84s)]
*  at the same time that there have been some Israeli politicians, including people like Ben-Ghivir, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1112.08s)]
*  suggesting that what they really want to do is displace all these people into Egypt. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1116.8s)]
*  That starts to become more and more a question about what the intention is here as they kind of [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1121.36s)]
*  push south, as the population pushes south. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1126.32s)]
*  But I think we do have to just kind of keep coming back to the scale of human suffering [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1128.72s)]
*  because it just points to the fact that getting in some more trucks of assistance is not the issue. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1132.0s)]
*  The issue is the military operation, the nature of the military operation. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1137.6s)]
*  And some aspects of that military operation have been dialed back from like at the height of the [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1142.16s)]
*  air campaign, but there are still people dying every single day. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1146.8s)]
*  And as you said, I think the point we also want to come back to is because people will say, well, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1151.92s)]
*  how can we trust this count? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1158.56s)]
*  As you indicated, the count is probably low, okay, because they can't get to everybody under the rubble. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1160.08s)]
*  Or some people say, well, what portion of these people that are a part of the count are Hamas? [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1166.1599999999999s)]
*  Well, 60% at least of these people are women and children. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1173.36s)]
*  I don't think those people are- Yeah, the Israeli estimate of the number of Hamas fighters they've killed is like 10,000. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1178.0s)]
*  Yeah. And the casualty count is 27,000 at least. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1182.96s)]
*  So the point is at some point, the rationalization of this military campaign depends upon the dehumanization of the people who are dying. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1185.28s)]
*  That may not be the intent of everybody who's rationalizing it, but it's the reality that when you have [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1197.52s)]
*  well over 10,000 kids dead and tens of thousands of additional kids, we'll just focus on the children here, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1205.68s)]
*  at risk of starvation in uninhabitable conditions with over 80% of the housing units in Gaza either destroyed or damaged. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1212.48s)]
*  What else is going on here? I mean, I don't know what else to say about it. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1221.92s)]
*  And the Biden people will say, look, we've really pushed hard on the Israelis to allow more aid into Gaza. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1225.6s)]
*  And like, I'm sure that is true, but what does it say about your partner, your interlocutor there? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1231.2s)]
*  You have to fight them to allow in aid so everyone doesn't starve to death. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1235.44s)]
*  Yeah. That's not a good setup. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1238.8s)]
*  If that's where the bar is here, the bar needs to be raised. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1240.32s)]
*  Also, Biden did put in place an executive order that will allow the United States to sanction [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1242.8s)]
*  violent settlers or those who support them, which I think is a big important policy and executive order. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1246.8s)]
*  But that is about the West Bank. It's not about what's happening in Gaza. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1251.2s)]
*  A couple more things in Gaza, though. So CNN reported that the IDF is pumping large volumes of sea water into Hamas' tunnels. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1255.6s)]
*  Not sure what that means for potential hostage rescue if they're in there. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1262.0s)]
*  There's also concern that it could screw up the freshwater tables in the region, but it's happening. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1266.32s)]
*  The New York Times just reported that Israeli intelligence thinks 32 of the 136 hostages have died, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1271.2s)]
*  which is tragic and awful. But I think also why you always hear the debates about a ceasefire and hostage release deal, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1277.2s)]
*  including bodies of those who have passed away. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1284.72s)]
*  The U.S. is reportedly pushing hard for a six-week ceasefire because they believe it will be impossible [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1288.4s)]
*  for Israel to fully ramp up operations again after that is over, which makes sense. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1293.52s)]
*  Enactios reported today that the U.S. is working on a separate diplomatic agreement [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1299.2s)]
*  to calm tensions between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. So that would of course be good. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1303.92s)]
*  One other thing, Ben. So last week we talked about UNRWA, the aid organization that provides [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1309.44s)]
*  relief to Palestinians, especially in Gaza. It's basically the only organization that has boots on [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1313.6s)]
*  the ground in Gaza that can distribute aid. The U.S. suspended support to UNRWA after Israeli [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1318.16s)]
*  allegations that UNRWA employees were part of the October 7th attacks. There's been sort of a lot [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1322.88s)]
*  more review of that decision happening as we speak. I think the U.S. is kind of walking it back a bit, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1328.3200000000002s)]
*  saying, well, actually we gave them all the aid for this year already, right? So maybe this [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1333.2800000000002s)]
*  won't have an impact, but there you're seeing other countries kind of follow our lead, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1337.6000000000001s)]
*  which is a problem. But here's a clip of Prime Minister Netanyahu elaborating on what he [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1341.0400000000002s)]
*  wants to see happen to UNRWA. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1346.64s)]
*  I think it's time that the international community and the UN itself understand that UNRWA's mission [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1348.16s)]
*  has to end. UNRWA is self-perpetuating. It is self-perpetuating also in its desire to keep alive [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1354.48s)]
*  the Palestinian refugee issue. And we need to get other UN agencies and other aid agencies [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1364.24s)]
*  replacing UNRWA if we're going to solve the problem of Gaza as we intend to do. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1371.6000000000001s)]
*  In that same press event, he also says that testimony from UNRWA employees were a big part [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1378.3200000000002s)]
*  of the ICJ genocide case. And it was interesting that he linked that with these concerns about [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1385.0400000000002s)]
*  UNRWA employees potentially being a part of Hamas or participating in the October 7th attacks. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1393.2s)]
*  Again, the Israeli concerns about UNRWA are not new, but it was interesting to hear Netanyahu say [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1398.08s)]
*  he basically wants the organization dissolved. That's his goal here. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1404.0s)]
*  Well, and here's what's happening ideologically. This is an important thing for people to [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1407.84s)]
*  understand about UNRWA and what Netanyahu is saying, because actually that doesn't have to do with [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1411.1999999999998s)]
*  whether or not some of them were in Hamas or not. Actually, it's bigger than that. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1415.9199999999998s)]
*  So UNRWA was set up in the late 40s when the Nakba happened, when hundreds of thousands [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1419.52s)]
*  of Palestinians were displaced and turned into refugees. By definition, refugees. They're [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1425.52s)]
*  driven from their homes. They're in camps. They're someplace else. The UN set up a special agency, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1430.08s)]
*  UNRWA, to deal with those refugee populations, to provide services to them. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1435.12s)]
*  The reason that Netanyahu and people of his ideological inclination in Israel [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1439.36s)]
*  want there to be no such thing as UNRWA anymore is because they don't want there to be any [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1443.92s)]
*  refugee status for Palestinians anymore. Exactly. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1448.8799999999999s)]
*  Because if Palestinians are categorized as refugees, maybe some of them obviously continue [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1451.36s)]
*  to argue they have a right to return to their homes. And obviously those homes are in Israel. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1457.4399999999998s)]
*  Or even as refugees who aren't going to be able to return to Israel, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1461.1999999999998s)]
*  they kind of stay where they are. What Netanyahu wants, and certainly Ben Gavir wants, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1466.32s)]
*  is he wants essentially those Palestinian populations. And he himself, by the way, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1470.3999999999999s)]
*  said this. The clip we played last week back from the 70s was about there is a [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1474.1599999999999s)]
*  Palestinian state, essentially it's Jordan. He wants the Palestinians that are in Lebanon [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1477.76s)]
*  and Jordan to not be thought of as Palestinians, as refugees. He wants them to just be thought of [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1482.48s)]
*  as Arabs who live in Jordan or who live in Lebanon. This is a really important ideological point [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1487.52s)]
*  that he wants to kind of erase a certain international legal categorization of identity [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1492.96s)]
*  for Palestinians. They're no longer refugees. They're just people that live in Jordan. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1497.44s)]
*  And that's it. And if you want to give them services, well, the UN has other bodies that [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1501.52s)]
*  can provide those services. And that's a huge tell about what the ideological project is behind [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1505.52s)]
*  this. To people who think, who may listen and think, well, you guys are hard on Israel. What [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1511.2s)]
*  I'd say is that I sincerely believe that the best outcome for Israel, the best way for Israel to [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1515.92s)]
*  live in peace with its neighbors is for there to be a Palestinian state. I think anybody, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1521.76s)]
*  including myself, who's looked at that doesn't think that you're going to have the right of [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1526.8s)]
*  return where everybody's going to move back to their homes in Israel proper. But you have to [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1529.52s)]
*  have a resettlement of those refugees in a new Palestinian state. And if you wipe out the [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1533.28s)]
*  categorization of them as refugees, you're wiping out essentially the idea of a Palestinian state. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1539.12s)]
*  So I disagree with Netanyahu about this is not about even just Palestinian aspirations. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1542.8799999999999s)]
*  It's about whether or not you think it's best for Israel to have there be a two-state solution. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1547.36s)]
*  He clearly does not think that. Yeah, this is a long-term project. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1551.44s)]
*  So let's talk about how public opinion of the war has changed in the US. There was an Associated [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1555.68s)]
*  Press poll the other day that found that half of US adults think that Israel's war in Gaza has [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1560.8799999999999s)]
*  gone too far. And only 31% of US adults approve of Biden's handling of the war in Gaza, including [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1567.04s)]
*  only 46% of Democrats. 33% of Republicans say Israel's military response has gone too far. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1573.04s)]
*  That's up from 18% in November. So there's been a huge movement there. 52% of independents are now [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1579.44s)]
*  in that place. NBC also did a big poll that came out over the weekend. There were some foreign [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1584.6399999999999s)]
*  policy questions. Trump defeats Biden by 11 points on the question of improving America's [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1589.6s)]
*  standing in the world. That used to be a strength for Biden. Only 29% approve of Biden's handling of [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1594.7199999999998s)]
*  the war in Gaza. It's down five points. And then among voters under 35 years old, only 15% approve [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1601.36s)]
*  of Biden's handling of the Israel Hamas war. 70% disapprove. So this war, obviously events are [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1608.6399999999999s)]
*  going very badly over in Israel, but the political impact it's having for Joe Biden [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1615.84s)]
*  and the prospect of reelection is incredibly damaging. And I think what we've talked about [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1620.9599999999998s)]
*  on this show is we know the administration is pushing hard behind the scenes for a ceasefire [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1626.48s)]
*  deal. They want a hostage release and some sort of negotiated solution, but they don't make those [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1630.8s)]
*  comments as forcefully in public. Politico reported that in private, Biden complains about [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1637.1999999999998s)]
*  Bibi Netanyahu. He calls him quote, a bad fucking guy. And he worries out loud about the US, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1642.56s)]
*  the risk of Bibi dragging the US into a wider Middle Eastern war because that conflict would [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1648.72s)]
*  buy Netanyahu more time politically to stay in power before Israeli voters push him out. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1653.12s)]
*  All we're asking is say the shit in public, Joe. We agree with you. We know it. Everyone knows [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1659.36s)]
*  this about Netanyahu. Every administration has hated Netanyahu since the nineties. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1664.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, except Trump. Yeah. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1667.9199999999998s)]
*  Except for Trump at well point. But like, I mean, even even Trump, though, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1669.0400000000002s)]
*  soured on him after. Trump's on him because he didn't back him on January 6th. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1672.96s)]
*  Yeah. And then he accused him of not supporting the Soleimani strike. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1675.92s)]
*  He basically treated Netanyahu like a Republican senator. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1679.1200000000001s)]
*  Like a congressman. Which is kind of funny in a way. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1682.96s)]
*  That's exactly right. But yeah, the politics of this are obvious and they've been obvious for a [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1685.92s)]
*  while. You could have seen this coming. I think what's telling about that overall number, because [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1692.16s)]
*  we talked about how the biggest problem for reelection is the intensity felt by a sliver [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1696.4s)]
*  of the electorate. Right. So it doesn't have to be like an overwhelming majority of Americans [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1701.8400000000001s)]
*  singing something. The Democratic coalition is so fragile. You know, the margins are so thin [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1705.52s)]
*  that if a few tens of thousands of people in a few states are like, you know what, I'm out, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1710.5600000000002s)]
*  I'm voting for a third party candidate, I'm sitting this out, Joe Biden will lose the election. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1715.2s)]
*  And that's kind of that's the thing you should be most concerned about. I'm struck by the overall [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1718.88s)]
*  numbers, Tommy, because as much as I don't want to talk down the scale of our own audience, it's [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1723.44s)]
*  not like 51% of Americans are world those here who are like following this really closely. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1727.76s)]
*  We don't know that's true. But the reality is that just the background [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1731.92s)]
*  noise of what's happening has reached enough people that they're like, yeah, I don't know. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1736.0800000000002s)]
*  It's just scary images on TV. Yeah. And it's scary images in a sense that we're getting [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1739.8400000000001s)]
*  dragged into something. Yeah. You know, it's like what we're bombing Yemen now and we're bombing [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1744.0800000000002s)]
*  Iraq and we're bombing Syria. We bombed three different countries, you know. And so I think [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1747.76s)]
*  it's just it should be a warning sign of why deescalation is actually the better politics, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1752.8s)]
*  even if it's not the thing that plays well in Washington. Right. And foreign policy is not [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1758.32s)]
*  usually the drivers in elections until it is totally like the War of Iraq, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1763.1200000000001s)]
*  until it's war rocks. Right. But you can watch like Biden's approval takes a huge hit around [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1767.04s)]
*  the Afghanistan withdrawal. And it's kind of fallen steadily ever since. That's a real demarcation [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1772.88s)]
*  there you can see in the average of both. Yeah, you don't you don't really win on foreign policy, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1778.56s)]
*  but you can lose on certain things. Speaking of losing, Ben, there have been some terrible [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1782.24s)]
*  dehumanizing op eds and articles written about the conflict in Gaza. There was a Wall Street [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1788.64s)]
*  Journal op ed from the director of the Middle East Media Research Institute, which I've never heard of [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1793.84s)]
*  calling Dearborn America's jihad capital. I wonder who funds them. Interesting to find out. And then [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1798.96s)]
*  Tom Friedman wrote an op ed about how to understand the Middle East through this extended metaphor [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1803.92s)]
*  comparison to the animal kingdom. And I didn't read it until today because I was like, I saw the [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1810.8s)]
*  outrage. I didn't read the thing. I'm just genuinely shocked that an editor didn't say to him, like, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1815.6s)]
*  hey, man, you've been around the block a while. Like comparing countries and people to animals [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1820.1599999999999s)]
*  is going to land as dehumanizing to some people. Maybe just start over. Yeah. And and look, the [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1824.3999999999999s)]
*  first one, the Wall Street Journal one was one of your classic astroturf organizations. That's like [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1832.0s)]
*  you said, the funding is like, well, who are there's always some group like this. You know, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1837.44s)]
*  we had to back in the day was like Frank Gaffney. Remember that guy? That guy was crazy. It was [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1840.8s)]
*  always like Islam Watch or something. And it was always, you know, super now he's a centrist [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1844.16s)]
*  Republican. Now he's probably like a never tremper. But yeah, maybe think about the idea of [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1848.56s)]
*  dehumanizing an entire city of people that, you know, it's a remarkable community, by the way, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1854.0s)]
*  Dearborn. But then the Tom Friedman one is even more kind of baffling and astonishing because [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1857.8400000000001s)]
*  it comparing a whole region of people to the animal kingdom and then also what the animals [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1864.72s)]
*  were like wasps and you know, the US was an aging lion. Right. So we credit ourselves. We got to be [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1871.84s)]
*  Mustafa and the Lion King. And then, you know, the the bad guys, quote unquote, were, you know, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1877.68s)]
*  all these various other animals. And it's a definition of dehumanization. I mean, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1882.8s)]
*  like literally dehumanizing them and turning them animals. And to your point, it does, you know, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1887.68s)]
*  speak to this kind of like lazy white guy kind of take I got an idea like we're gonna call them [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1893.92s)]
*  the animals. And actually, I kind of do like you kind of faulty like, does anyone kind of look like [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1898.88s)]
*  give this a pass like, well, Lebanon, Yemen, and Syria, Iraq, they're caterpillars. What, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1906.3200000000002s)]
*  Tom, what are you doing? Yeah, like a creature you could step on, you know, and again, I'm sure Tom [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1912.3200000000002s)]
*  Friedman wasn't thinking that he was doing that. But that's your point that that's when an editor [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1918.96s)]
*  comes in and is like, actually, can we get maybe there's a different metaphor. Maybe there's a [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1924.88s)]
*  food metaphor. Oh, yeah. Or a I don't know, historical analogy. What if what if the world [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1928.48s)]
*  was flat? But there's there's a metaphor. What if you took a cab somewhere and talked to that person [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1934.72s)]
*  and then wrote up some shit? That was bad. So then sticking in Washington. So a lot of Biden's foreign [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1939.7600000000002s)]
*  policy priorities are now tied up in this fight over immigration and supplemental funding requests [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1945.6s)]
*  in Congress. Great PSA, by the way. Oh, yesterday recommend America. That shows fine. So remember, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1949.6s)]
*  so remember, like the MAGA Republicans, they've decided that Ukraine is bad supporting Ukraine is [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1956.8799999999999s)]
*  bad. So Biden tried to link funding for Ukraine with a supplemental funding request for Israel [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1961.12s)]
*  to make it politically palatable or at least hard to vote against. Republicans said no way, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1966.1599999999999s)]
*  we're not going to provide more funding for Ukraine until we secure our own border. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1970.7199999999998s)]
*  So Senator James Langford, this conservative Republican from Oklahoma, worked with Democrats [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1974.56s)]
*  like Chris Murphy, friend of the pod from Connecticut to negotiate an immigration bill. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1978.64s)]
*  And then they released the final text of that bill on Sunday. It had immigration, it had Ukraine, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1983.3600000000001s)]
*  it had, you know, Israel funding, it had Indo Pacific countering China funding, or the whole [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1987.92s)]
*  smorgasbord. And then it took about 12 hours, 24 hours for Republicans to immediately walk away [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1994.08s)]
*  from the bill, including Langford, who wrote the bill negotiated the thing and now won't say whether [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=1999.92s)]
*  he supports his own bill. Mitch McConnell portrays himself as a cold warrior staunch supporter of [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2005.28s)]
*  Ukraine. He instantly caved under pressure from Trump, who said this bill would be a gift to Biden [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2010.4s)]
*  because he wants to run on the border being a mess. So Ben, Ukraine got a little bit of good [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2015.8400000000001s)]
*  news recently. EU leaders achieved a breakthrough on a deal to provide 50 billion euros to Ukraine [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2020.5600000000002s)]
*  through 2027. They had to overcome opposition from Viktor Orban in Hungary, which is not easy, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2025.36s)]
*  but they did it. But this bill in the Senate contained 60 billion for Ukraine, 14 billion for [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2030.32s)]
*  Israel, 10 billion for humanitarian aid for conflict zones, including Gaza, and billions to [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2036.1599999999999s)]
*  counter China in the Pacific. And like people need to understand, this is existential for Ukrainians. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2041.28s)]
*  Like there are reports that the Ukrainian military is running out of ammo on the battlefield as we [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2047.6799999999998s)]
*  speak. They may lose the battle for the city of Divka. And so I don't know, I guess I'm just sort [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2052.8s)]
*  of like at a loss. If that combination of policies can't get Republican support, what will? Like how [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2059.6000000000004s)]
*  do you get these people to be serious and actually govern? I'm out of ideas. Yeah, you saw kind of [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2065.6800000000003s)]
*  the when Mike Johnson, I always forget. Speaker Johnson. Yeah, Speaker Johnson. You know, he [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2072.4s)]
*  suggested that he wanted to put up a clean bill of just the Israeli, right? Yeah, he pulled one up [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2078.1600000000003s)]
*  17.6 billion for Israel. And again, we've been hard on Biden, like a good message from Biden that he [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2082.3199999999997s)]
*  would veto that standalone bill and not kind of succumb to the cynicism of kind of pushing that [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2088.3999999999996s)]
*  through. Some also good, I see some good moves potentially from the Biden administration to try [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2093.12s)]
*  to find other ways to get some assistance to Ukraine. Like there's excess stockpiles of US [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2100.72s)]
*  weapons in Europe that maybe you can redirect under existing authorities to the Ukrainians. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2106.48s)]
*  But just so people understand this, I mean, this isn't just, you know, some new fancy capability [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2111.52s)]
*  won't get the Ukrainians. This isn't like, oh, we're going to send them F-16s. This is like the [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2117.44s)]
*  basic nuts and bolts, artillery, the stuff that if you're on the Ukrainian front line right now, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2121.84s)]
*  and you've been fighting your fucking ass off for two years, two years to save your country, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2127.68s)]
*  to stand up to Vladimir Putin, and you've gotten waves of like Wagner group conflicts, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2133.12s)]
*  coming at you. You've got the Russians bombing your kids, you know, in your homes back behind you. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2138.72s)]
*  And you're sitting there and all of a sudden, like someone's going to tell you, you know what, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2146.24s)]
*  actually, like we have a quarter of the artillery that we need because- [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2150.24s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2154.64s)]
*  ... some fucking MAGA people are trying to make a point and Donald Trump needs to run on the border. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2157.04s)]
*  I would be losing my mind. I can't imagine. I mean, I think we should, you know, we were [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2162.72s)]
*  texting about this like, just be clear about the empathy we feel to the Ukrainians who've done [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2167.28s)]
*  everything that they've been asked and have sacrificed, you know, 70,000 casualties, at least, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2173.28s)]
*  like everything on the line. And there's some dumb political game in Washington. And look, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2178.2400000000002s)]
*  even if you're skeptical of Ukraine aid, and I think you and I are very open to like diplomatic [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2183.6800000000003s)]
*  approaches, and I don't think any of those are going to happen before the election anyway, [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2188.96s)]
*  because Putin's going to wait for that. And we can talk about that in the context of our buddy [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2192.1600000000003s)]
*  Tucker. But even if you're skeptical about it, as a country, we have like led these people to believe [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2194.88s)]
*  that we're there for them. And so whether you agree with the approach in Ukraine or not, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2202.0s)]
*  leading these people to believe that we're there, we're in the fight, here you go, here's the [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2209.12s)]
*  spigot of weapons that are coming your way so you can get in this fight, to turn that off in the [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2213.04s)]
*  middle- Just pull the rug out. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2217.2000000000003s)]
*  ... is totally reprehensible. It's totally like cutting those people loose when they're in a life [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2218.4s)]
*  and death situation. I usually, as you know, refrain from the like, something happens over [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2224.64s)]
*  here in the world and the other people over here are going to look at that and think you're not [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2230.56s)]
*  reliable. I actually make an exception to that rule in this case. Where I usually object to that, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2233.68s)]
*  it's like, oh, if we bomb this country over here, this other country will be- [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2239.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2241.7599999999998s)]
*  This is more just like, do we keep agreements? And to lead a country to believe that we're there [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2242.56s)]
*  for them and then remove it, and this is not at all Joe Biden's fault or anybody in his [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2248.8799999999997s)]
*  administration. This is entirely on these MAGA people. It's so reprehensible and it's not kind [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2253.2s)]
*  of breaking through because people are substantively obviously interested in the border. Politically, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2259.8399999999997s)]
*  they're interested in our election. Just bear a thought for what this means for the Ukrainians. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2263.52s)]
*  It's good that the EU, it's a good test that they stood up and were like, you know what? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2268.48s)]
*  At a minimum, we're going to come on and kick in essentially about the same amount of money [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2272.16s)]
*  that the Americans were committing between 55 and 60 billion. Some of that though is for [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2276.08s)]
*  supporting Ukrainian government. The Europeans cannot make the Ukrainians whole on things like [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2280.96s)]
*  artillery. They just don't have the capacity and the pace to do it. So it is what it is and it sucks, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2285.92s)]
*  is the truth. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2291.28s)]
*  It's terrible. And this bill that was negotiated in the Senate is like the Republican wishlist. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2292.2400000000002s)]
*  It's, yeah. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2297.52s)]
*  Including, by the way, support for Ukraine used to be something that was on their wishlist. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2298.48s)]
*  It is the worst politics. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2301.28s)]
*  Israel, Taiwan, it's literally like a right-wing Republican bill. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2303.76s)]
*  Favreau made fun of me a little bit for suggesting this, but I do wonder, I mean, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2309.2799999999997s)]
*  being tough on China is like the number one thing that pops in all these Republican primary ads and [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2313.52s)]
*  polling. I do wonder if you can portray Republican opposition to this bill as being soft on China in [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2318.72s)]
*  some sort of effective way. I don't know. It's kind of a bank shot. It would require some nimble [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2324.24s)]
*  messaging to make it work, but I'd rather try. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2329.6s)]
*  If we put this bill forward in 2015 in the Obama years, people would have thought we'd lost our [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2332.08s)]
*  minds. And somehow the White House got hijacked by Dick Cheney. It's bonkers. And maybe Tommy, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2337.36s)]
*  what needs to be done is someone needs to let Hugh Hewitt know that, not to be too inside [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2344.6400000000003s)]
*  the world though here, but that there's ships. There's ships. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2348.96s)]
*  Oh, funding for building ships. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2351.76s)]
*  Indo-Pacific ships. I don't even know if that's in the bill, but we just, yeah. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2353.6800000000003s)]
*  Maybe we just send Hugh to the Indo-Pacific and he can find out for himself. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2356.0s)]
*  Lots of news out of Ukraine itself too, Ben. So President Zelensky said he's considering a shake [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2359.92s)]
*  up, not just in the military, but also his political leadership. So last week there was [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2364.08s)]
*  some reports that he summoned his top general to tell him he'd been fired. Then he seemed to back [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2368.08s)]
*  off that firing. And now it looks like the shakeup might be happening and might be even bigger. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2373.04s)]
*  Zelensky gave an interview to an Italian TV station over the weekend and he said, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2378.7999999999997s)]
*  a reset, a new beginning is necessary. I have something serious in mind, which is not about [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2383.36s)]
*  a single person, but about my direction of the country's leadership. So there's a bunch of [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2387.6s)]
*  things at play here. He might be firing the folks who were in charge of the failed counteroffensive [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2392.8s)]
*  as a way to show that they're learning from that mistake. They may just be increasingly at odds [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2399.84s)]
*  with each other, Zelensky and his top generals. Additionally though, obviously the country is [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2406.1600000000003s)]
*  sick of being at war. There's concern about a new mobilization effort that would bring up to 500,000 [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2411.28s)]
*  new conscripts into the fight. There's reports about corruption. Last week, the Ukrainian [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2416.7200000000003s)]
*  security service announced that it uncovered a $40 million corruption scheme among military [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2421.92s)]
*  officials who signed a contract for a hundred thousand artillery shells, none of which were [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2426.0s)]
*  ever delivered. I don't know if you saw Masha Gessen as a piece in the New Yorker this week. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2429.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's good. Yeah, about democratic backsliding in Ukraine. The pieces of that [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2434.16s)]
*  are basically, it's a long piece, but there's the martial law declaration that's been in place since [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2437.44s)]
*  the day after the invasion that controls who can and can't enter the country. The media has been [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2442.0s)]
*  tightly regulated by the government and taken over in some instances. They can't have elections [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2447.28s)]
*  because it's not safe and because a huge chunk of the population is out of Ukraine. Ben, none of us [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2452.0800000000004s)]
*  want to fly-speck a country at war or a leader at war. Zelensky has clearly shown unimaginable [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2457.76s)]
*  courage in the face of the invasion and occupation. Historically speaking, [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2464.4s)]
*  crises like this can lead to political leaders becoming entrenched and some democratic backsliding. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2470.0s)]
*  How do you think the US and mostly the EU probably should handle these delicate conversations about [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2477.52s)]
*  supporting Ukraine in this time of crisis, but also not letting it change its fundamental identity? [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2485.04s)]
*  There's a lot that's been going on and that's a good summary. Clearly, Zelensky and General Zaluzny, [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2491.36s)]
*  who's a top commander, is hugely popular in Ukraine, is more popular than Zelensky. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2497.92s)]
*  I think there's a long min of thought that that was a source of tension, that you essentially add, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2503.28s)]
*  these are the two most popular people in Ukraine. I don't know if General Zaluzny has any political [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2507.36s)]
*  ambitions or not. What is the case is that if Zelensky was the guy who helped save Ukraine by [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2511.6s)]
*  not leaving their initial days and showing such courage and then mobilizing this world assistance, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2518.0s)]
*  General Zaluzny is the guy who came up with this ingenious strategy essentially of like [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2523.28s)]
*  baiting the Russians into extending their supply lines and then just relentlessly attacking the [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2527.68s)]
*  supply lines. I'm not a military guy, I played risk like some people. I was obviously was in a lot of [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2532.16s)]
*  these conversations in the room, but I wasn't making military strategy. But I know enough to [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2540.0s)]
*  know that this guy made a lot of right calls. He also did the fake offensive in the South before [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2543.9199999999996s)]
*  the offensive in the North. So clearly this guy knows what he's doing. But lately they're [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2551.2s)]
*  not on the same page publicly. They've not been on the same page. He did an interview with the [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2555.6s)]
*  economists. The Bakhmut thing, remember, there was like, why are we so focused on this place? [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2558.4s)]
*  And who knows, maybe, again, precisely because I'm not a military strategist, [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2563.68s)]
*  sometimes you need to change commanders even if they're great commanders. A different phase of [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2567.2799999999997s)]
*  the war might need a new person. I don't know. What is concerning is when you have this kind of, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2570.72s)]
*  clearly Zelensky wants him gone, but he's not willing to kind of push him out. He's probably [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2576.64s)]
*  suggested it seems like from reports that he should resign, but he doesn't want to resign. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2581.84s)]
*  That kind of civil military tension is just uncomfortable given the stakes for the Ukrainians. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2585.6800000000003s)]
*  And then I think in terms of the broader question about Zelensky himself or just [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2591.6000000000004s)]
*  the risk of corruption as the war goes on, because we should be clear, it's not like Ukraine had [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2595.6000000000004s)]
*  solved all those problems with corruption in its military and its medical system. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2601.36s)]
*  I think the EU can be really important here because however this war is going to end, [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2605.2000000000003s)]
*  it may end in unsatisfying kind of frozen conflict in a year or two in a negotiation. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2611.2799999999997s)]
*  The best carrot right now, the best incentive for the Ukrainians is EU membership. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2617.04s)]
*  It's not the same thing as NATO, but it's in some ways more important for them as a country [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2622.0s)]
*  to be in that block. A lot comes with that. A lot comes with that in terms of the rule of law, [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2627.04s)]
*  in terms of civil military relations, in terms of corruption. And I just think the EU providing, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2631.84s)]
*  and especially given that they just kicked in all this assistance, they can be the sunlight, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2636.48s)]
*  the transparency and the incentive for there not to be backsliding. And so I hope that this [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2642.88s)]
*  is something that can be a real European focus and the US can obviously reinforce it. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2648.64s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's exactly right. Speaking of revered military leaders, Tucker Carlson is in [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2652.88s)]
*  Moscow with David Sacks probably now he's alone. This afternoon he announced in a video posted on [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2658.2400000000002s)]
*  Twitter that he has interviewed Vladimir Putin. Here's a clip of Tucker talking about why they [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2664.32s)]
*  went to Moscow for this interview. Here's why we're doing it. First, because it's our job. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2669.84s)]
*  We're in journalism. Our duty is to inform people. Two years into a war that's reshaping [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2674.6400000000003s)]
*  the entire world, most Americans are not informed. They have no real idea what's happening in this [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2680.96s)]
*  region here in Russia or 600 miles away in Ukraine. But they should know they're paying for much of [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2686.96s)]
*  it in ways they might not fully yet perceive. The war in Ukraine is a human disaster. It's left [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2693.92s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of people dead, an entire generation of young Ukrainians, and it's depopulated [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2700.56s)]
*  the largest country in Europe. But the long-term effects are even more profound. This war has [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2706.48s)]
*  utterly reshaped the global military and trade alliances, and the sanctions that followed have [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2713.44s)]
*  as well. And in total, they have upended the world economy. The post-World War II economic order, [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2719.28s)]
*  the system that guaranteed prosperity in the West for more than 80 years, is coming apart very fast, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2725.76s)]
*  and along with it, the dominance of the US dollar. These are not small changes. They are [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2731.44s)]
*  history-altering developments. They will define the lives of our grandchildren. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2736.8s)]
*  So Tucker also says in this little clip, quote, not a single Western journalist has bothered to [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2741.28s)]
*  interview the president of the other country involved in this conflict, Vladimir Putin. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2747.52s)]
*  Now, I actually don't have a problem with Tucker interviewing Putin. I don't think it'll be a good [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2751.36s)]
*  interview. I don't think we'll ask him the right questions. I don't think we'll learn anything from [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2755.76s)]
*  it. But as a general matter, I'm not someone who's going to shout down someone for doing an interview. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2758.88s)]
*  That said, that claim that no other journalist has tried is utter bullshit. I'm sure dozens of [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2764.8s)]
*  them have tried. Christiane Amanpour immediately said she's been trying to interview Putin since [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2770.0s)]
*  the day the war started. What is far more interesting is why Putin would give an interview [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2773.04s)]
*  to Tucker. I suspect it's a couple of factors. One, he obviously knows that Tucker opposes US [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2778.72s)]
*  support for Ukraine, that Tucker is influential in Republican circles. He's probably trying to [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2783.36s)]
*  help stymie this supplemental funding bill that's going through Congress right now. He's trying to [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2788.24s)]
*  help Trump because Putin prefers Trump. We know that. But there's also a bigger picture, Ben, [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2791.84s)]
*  that I think Putin's conservative, white, religious, ethno-nationalist worldview is a lot more like [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2797.12s)]
*  Tucker's worldview than I think Tucker's fans would care to admit, or than Tucker is really [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2805.2s)]
*  alike Joe Biden, for example, at least at this point in his career. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2810.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's exactly right. First of all, something weird with Tucker, he always says we [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2814.8799999999997s)]
*  and our- I know. The royal we, him and his producer? [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2820.08s)]
*  He's just a guy. I know. With a website. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2823.28s)]
*  I guess he's got some people with him, so maybe he's a good team leader. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2825.84s)]
*  Team at TuckerCrawlson.com. It does seem like a royal we. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2828.7200000000003s)]
*  Grading, yeah. Yeah, I think the two key points here are one, [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2832.2400000000002s)]
*  Tucker will say some things that you find yourself agreeing with. He's like, [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2838.96s)]
*  Americans have no idea how fucking crazy this war is and hundreds of thousands of people have died [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2843.44s)]
*  and it's had these huge consequences, but that's true. I kind of appreciate when Tucker has this [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2847.92s)]
*  discussed for war and stuff, but Putin's the guy who did the war. What's so maddening about listening [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2856.0s)]
*  to him is it's not like the Ukrainians invaded Russia. Even if you're somebody who thinks that [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2861.6800000000003s)]
*  we shouldn't have given Ukrainian NATO membership, Vladimir Putin invaded this country and he acts [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2867.52s)]
*  like that didn't happen. The war broke out or something. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2874.2400000000002s)]
*  Putin also went through five different stated reasons why. It was like, [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2877.68s)]
*  Nazis were committing genocide against Russian speakers. There's all this bullshit early on. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2881.52s)]
*  He has another piece in this video which I watched, unfortunately, where he talks about [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2887.6s)]
*  he's doing this for free speech. Well, guess who doesn't have free speech? Any journalist in Russia. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2891.6s)]
*  Anyway, that's obvious. I think the more interesting point is when you end it on, [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2896.88s)]
*  which is the ideology of this. There's a bit of a tell in that when he talks about the system [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2900.16s)]
*  that guaranteed prosperity in the West. This is a guy, Putin's ideological project, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2906.16s)]
*  which we haven't talked about in a while, but we've talked about a lot in the past, [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2912.56s)]
*  is essentially this kind of white Christian nationalist. It's anti-LGBT, it's anti-Muslim, [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2914.96s)]
*  it's anti-he's taken up the cancel culture cause. But he really is this kind of white supremacist. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2921.7599999999998s)]
*  Putin is like a white supremacist. I think Tucker really truly believes that we should be allies [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2929.44s)]
*  with Putin. Actually, Vivek weirdly gave that somehow we're going to flip Putin against the [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2937.84s)]
*  Chinese. That essentially the natural- Oh yeah, the 5D chess. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2943.68s)]
*  Yeah, but I think these guys naturally believe that there's this kind of white Christian guy [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2946.8s)]
*  like in Moscow, maybe they're Orthodox Christians, but they're all in the kind of white team, [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2951.6s)]
*  the Christian team and an Orban and we hate Muslims and we hate gay people and we hate [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2957.12s)]
*  Taylor Swift and Travis Cussey. I wouldn't be surprised if Tucker asked about that, [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2963.6s)]
*  but that's truly what these people believe. I think the reason the interview is useful [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2969.7599999999998s)]
*  is I think it does illuminate that that's the stakes in this election. Yes, it's about the war [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2974.0s)]
*  in Ukraine, but it's also basically like Trump wins. That's actually what we're going to be doing. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2979.92s)]
*  We're going to be like, you know what? Yeah, we're with this far right kind of white nationalist [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2984.24s)]
*  Christian us versus everybody else and the dollar has to be strong to control the economies of the [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2988.8799999999997s)]
*  global South. Again, it's a coherent worldview. I actually give Tucker, credit's the wrong word, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=2996.64s)]
*  but at least he says the quiet part out loud because you can then think about it and respond [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3004.24s)]
*  to it in ways that the MAGA people in Congress are too dumb to know. They don't even really know [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3008.56s)]
*  the ideological project they're part of. Tucker actually articulates what this ideological project [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3013.04s)]
*  is all about and I think that is pretty much where Trump is. Trump himself may be not smart [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3018.0s)]
*  enough to fully realize exactly what he's doing, but I think he instinctively gets it and that's [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3024.32s)]
*  why I'm actually interested to see this interview. Look, Tucker's been running Tucker on Russian TV, [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3028.56s)]
*  so he's actually a familiar face. Yeah, he's well known. Because if you watch all these [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3033.84s)]
*  bloodthirsty Russian TV channels, they always have some Tucker segments, so he's kind of a [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3037.84s)]
*  Russian TV personality too. Yeah, I mean, obviously we'll watch the interview when it comes out. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3041.44s)]
*  We'll probably talk about it next week. We'll see if he asks Putin about the death toll in Ukraine [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3046.08s)]
*  or the lies about defeating Nazis. Or let's say Navalny or journalism in Russia. Yeah, Navalny, [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3051.84s)]
*  Evan Gershvitch, journalists that are, including American journalists that are in prison, but I [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3056.8s)]
*  don't think he will. Yeah, or he might. And then Putin's actually not, he gives some weird creepy [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3060.88s)]
*  answer. He kind of half smiles and he's like, oh, we will see what happens to our friend. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3066.56s)]
*  Yeah, and it's going to be through a translation. It'll be hard to push back in real time, but we'll [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3070.9599999999996s)]
*  see. Anyway. I'm looking for the Tucker reaction shot. So does he do the kind of befuddled, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3074.3999999999996s)]
*  that look he gives people? Or the kind of childish giggle. Oh, Vlad, so funny. All right, [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3079.12s)]
*  a couple more things. We're running a little long, but that's okay. So Ben, El Salvador held elections [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3085.3599999999997s)]
*  this past Sunday and the incumbent Rafael Bukele claimed a landslide victory, even though the votes [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3089.52s)]
*  are still technically being counted. But, you know, also little side note here, the constitution [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3094.56s)]
*  does not allow a president to serve consecutive terms. So this was not, you know, not what he was [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3100.88s)]
*  supposed to be doing. Bukele put his country into state of emergency two years ago to take on gang [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3105.36s)]
*  violence. It has both made him super popular and has done incredible damage to civil liberties. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3109.12s)]
*  More than 75,000 people have been arrested and human rights organizations warn that thousands of [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3113.92s)]
*  innocent people have been swept up in the crackdown and are just rotting in jails. Secretary of State [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3118.96s)]
*  Tony Blinken responded to the election on Twitter Monday writing, we look forward to continuing to [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3123.68s)]
*  prioritize good governance, inclusive economic prosperity, fair trial guarantees and human [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3128.24s)]
*  rights in El Salvador. So Tony, I think sees the writing on the wall there that Bukele likely won [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3132.96s)]
*  the election, even if there were some inconsistencies in the reporting and the way it went down. And that [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3138.24s)]
*  statement is obviously kind of a aspirational set of things we hope to collaborate with El Salvador [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3145.2s)]
*  on. We spoke with Luis Villarera, a democracy activist from El Salvador, who founded an [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3151.44s)]
*  organization called Tricota, which focuses on building technological tools to combat corruption [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3155.36s)]
*  and foster democracy about Bukele's reelection. Here's a clip. I'm wearing black, like all black, [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3159.92s)]
*  because it seems right, because they kill democracy in El Salvador with the reelection that [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3166.2400000000002s)]
*  is not in the constitution, is unconstitutional. The problem is that at some point, [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3175.6000000000004s)]
*  everything is going to implode and then or explode in the country and that is going to resolve [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3181.12s)]
*  in migration. We already see that with Venezuela, with Cuba, and for sure this is not going to be [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3187.12s)]
*  sustainable in the long run. Like the exception state having like almost 3% of the population in [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3196.72s)]
*  jail without the process and how people is like saying, okay, the international community is [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3204.64s)]
*  saying it's okay to do that. And the thing is like other countries in the Western hemisphere [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3209.44s)]
*  are adopting these measures. In Ecuador, they try to do the same. In Honduras, they try to do the same. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3215.84s)]
*  So yeah, and in his speech, for example, he attacked international communities, he attacked [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3222.96s)]
*  nonprofits, he attacked civil society organizations and journalists. So that's something that we need [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3229.92s)]
*  to be afraid of because things are going to get worse. Ben, we've talked about Bukele a lot on the [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3236.8s)]
*  show. I mean, his sort of tenure is marked by these crackdowns where he just throws people in jail, [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3244.6400000000003s)]
*  whether or not they're accused of anything, and also his embrace of Bitcoin and the idiots in the [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3250.1600000000003s)]
*  United States who sort of like took that at face value and supported him. But pretty troubling that [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3256.0s)]
*  this super authoritarian approach to policing has made Bukele by far the most popular leader in [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3262.16s)]
*  Latin America. In the whole hemisphere. By far. He pulls 80%. He's legit popular. And look, [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3267.8399999999997s)]
*  we could be too glib about the guy because the crypto stuff and the hat backwards kind of, [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3276.64s)]
*  but he actually had, like Tucker, he has a good approach, right? And the approach is just autocracy [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3280.56s)]
*  and strongman politics and lock people up. And clearly that approach is working politically for [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3285.76s)]
*  him. And it's working substantively in the sense that violence is way down. Actually, El Salvadorian [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3292.32s)]
*  migration to the US border is way down. It's the only country where you've seen a huge drop. But I [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3299.6000000000004s)]
*  actually think Luis in the clip puts his finger on it. I just think that's a sugar high. When you [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3305.1200000000003s)]
*  bottle things up like this and you put 3% of the country in prison and you just dismantle democracy, [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3311.76s)]
*  the bill is going to come due. And if I was an ordinary Salvadorian right now, I might be like, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3318.5600000000004s)]
*  well, things are better. Like this guy, the gangs aren't in charge anymore. It's safer on the streets. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3323.6800000000003s)]
*  But then you look up in five years and you've got like a corrupt despot. And there's some version of [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3329.6000000000004s)]
*  the gangs back. Throwing your totally innocent cousin in jail. And you have no recourse anymore [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3336.0s)]
*  because the democracy is gone. So you can't vote him out. And that's what's so scary about these [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3340.48s)]
*  moments is yes, people want to say, well, he is democratically the most popular guy. Well, [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3344.2400000000002s)]
*  he just changed the constitution basically to let himself stay in power. And if you think that the [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3349.36s)]
*  first thing he's going to do now is not to further dismantle democracy, you don't pay attention to [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3353.6s)]
*  these things. And again, I think Luis, what's going to need to happen is some kind of longterm [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3357.92s)]
*  building of some alternative here. Because yeah, like, I don't know, I could be proven wrong, [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3362.64s)]
*  but I just have a feeling that this approach in the long run, and the long run might be a few years, [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3368.88s)]
*  suddenly what felt really good for a couple of years, you look up and you're like, oh, [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3376.08s)]
*  fuck. Yes. Strong men don't always wear well over time. Big picture, Ben. Looking forward, [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3379.44s)]
*  2024 is going to be a big test for the future of democracy all over the world, including in [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3386.88s)]
*  the United States. A couple races and data points that we're watching. So first, there were some [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3390.96s)]
*  polls recently out of Europe that are forecasting far right parties are going to gain a number of [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3396.96s)]
*  seats during the EU elections in June. That is troubling. And that rise in these far right parties [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3402.16s)]
*  is going to come with the center left parties taking a big hit. Second, Pakistan is holding [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3407.84s)]
*  an election on February 8th, but it is shaping up to be anything but free and fair. So former [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3414.96s)]
*  Prime Minister Imran Khan has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for allegedly leaking state [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3419.36s)]
*  secrets. A lot of people think that sentence is just a pretext for the Pakistani military to crack [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3424.0s)]
*  down on Khan and put restrictions on his political party, like removing their logo from the ballots, [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3428.88s)]
*  et cetera. There's all kinds of shit happening. And then third, in Senegal, President Mackie Saul [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3434.4s)]
*  signed a decree postponing their election. It was supposed to be on February 25th, but it's been [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3438.56s)]
*  pushed. The government is also disqualifying opposition candidates and restricted internet [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3444.56s)]
*  access on mobile phones after protesters took to the streets. So Ben, we're talking about very [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3448.4s)]
*  different countries, regions of the world here, systems of government in some cases, but the common [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3453.2s)]
*  theme is a threat to democracy and democratic norms and a trajectory that does not feel very good. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3458.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, the year of elections is not off to a roaring start for democracy. I mean, I think you're right [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3465.9199999999996s)]
*  to point out that these places are different. And we're right to put this in the same segment, [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3470.72s)]
*  because what is so troubling is countries as different as El Salvador and Senegal and Pakistan [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3474.48s)]
*  are all showing that they're part of this trend of essentially extraditional approaches to politics. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3480.96s)]
*  Right? Bukhara changes the law, lets himself stay in office. The Pakistani military, or whomever, [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3486.96s)]
*  orchestrating Imran Khan's removal from the scene to pick the leader however they want. And then [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3493.2s)]
*  Mackie Saul, he was the guy that he had surprised people in a good way by saying he wasn't one for [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3498.8s)]
*  this third term. Everybody's happy about that. I think we welcome that on this show. And actually, [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3503.76s)]
*  weirdly, his party was already primed to win. So it's ambiguous why he's doing this. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3508.48s)]
*  And again, keep in mind this is in West Africa. ECOWAS is the regional group of countries that [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3514.32s)]
*  includes all these coup states. And Senegal is usually the more advanced, committed to democracy [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3519.04s)]
*  in the neighborhood. So it does just tell you where the pendulum's going, and it's not going in the [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3526.08s)]
*  direction of the small D Democrats. Not great. Not great. But let's turn to Northern Ireland, [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3533.68s)]
*  where it was historic weekend. So for the first time in 100 years, the top job of first minister [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3538.48s)]
*  is going to be held by a nationalist member of the Sinn Fein party, Michelle O'Neill. Sinn Fein has [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3544.8799999999997s)]
*  historic ties to the IRA, the former extremist group. Well, I guess still an extremist group. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3550.3199999999997s)]
*  But this is a huge moment for them in their evolution into politics from something else. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3555.6s)]
*  Recent polls across Ireland suggest a majority of people still do not support unification, [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3560.8s)]
*  but the very fact that O'Neill was appointed to the position would have been unthinkable [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3564.6400000000003s)]
*  until recent years. This once fringe political wing of the IRA won the popular vote in 2020, [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3568.5600000000004s)]
*  and they've gained momentum among young people in particular by supporting causes like housing [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3573.84s)]
*  and representing a shift away from the status quo. Here's a clip from O'Neill's appointment. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3578.0800000000004s)]
*  I am honored to stand here as First Minister. We mark a moment of equality and a moment of progress. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3582.8s)]
*  A new opportunity to work and to grow together. Confident in that wherever we come from, [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3590.3199999999997s)]
*  whatever our aspirations are, we can and we must build our future together. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3597.2799999999997s)]
*  So Ben, what do you think this means for the future of Northern Ireland? [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3601.6s)]
*  First of all, I could listen to it all day. And, you know, can we get some more Irish clips on the [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3605.2799999999997s)]
*  show? Any Irish voice? It's my fault that clip started 60 seconds. I cut it down for time, [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3608.96s)]
*  but I wish I had. Also, Michelle O'Neill, not to be confused with Michael O'Neill, [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3613.36s)]
*  former remain a man. Look, it's a huge deal. I mean, to have someone, you know, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3618.0800000000004s)]
*  Sinn Fein, obviously, legacy IRA, you know, they go on this political journey to the Good Friday [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3623.6000000000004s)]
*  Accords and to have her standing up there and talking about, I mean, number one, the fact that [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3628.2400000000002s)]
*  someone from Sinn Fein is giving a message like that, like, I want to govern for everybody. And [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3635.0400000000004s)]
*  I'm sure, you know, maybe there are people on the other team that don't believe that. But just the [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3639.36s)]
*  fact that that's the kind of political orientation, I think is important and powerful. And it's, look, [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3643.92s)]
*  if you're going to have a Good Friday Accord and you're going to have power sharing, you're going [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3648.4s)]
*  to have to have a Sinn Fein leader at some point, you know, or else what is it really? It's not [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3652.96s)]
*  really power sharing. And at the same time, the fact that she's trying to identify this agenda, [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3656.96s)]
*  that whether you're Catholic or Protestant or Republican, you know, unification person or not, [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3662.56s)]
*  you care about housing, you care about education, compared to the economy, that's smart. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3668.64s)]
*  I do think that this question lurks in the backdrop. This is also post-Brexit, right? And [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3672.24s)]
*  so part of the reason that Sinn Fein won this election is because of the post-Brexit politics [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3676.24s)]
*  of Northern Ireland. And, you know, some of the Sinn Fein has a presence in the Irish parliament, [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3680.56s)]
*  too. And some of them are like, well, this is great. We can finally see unification on the [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3685.9199999999996s)]
*  horizon. I do think that at some point, and I'm not taking a position on this, I swear to God, [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3689.52s)]
*  come on, I'm just saying at some point, in the not too distant future, I don't think there's [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3694.9599999999996s)]
*  going to be necessarily, this will be an issue. Like this is going to, you know, God forbid, [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3699.92s)]
*  hopefully not a violent one. But like, I do think, you know, at some point, Brexit, you know, Brexit [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3705.44s)]
*  made this more of an issue because people in Northern Ireland, a lot of them want to be in [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3711.76s)]
*  the EU, you know? And so I don't think that's the headline of what's happening here, but it is in [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3716.32s)]
*  the backdrop. Yeah, to the extent that Good Friday Agreement kind of healed the wound, it was pretty [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3720.64s)]
*  recently, we're doing one in the 90s, you know, this is in like ancient history. So a pretty [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3724.16s)]
*  remarkable evolution. Interesting too that she took the, she actually in that same talk, I think, [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3728.0s)]
*  called for ceasefire and express solidarity to the Palestinians. It reminds you that there's this [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3733.92s)]
*  kind of solidarity. You know, ANC, IRA, you know, it was interesting call back to that era. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3737.36s)]
*  Yeah. And you know, Ben, look, I know the Irish aren't the biggest fans of the monarchy, [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3744.8s)]
*  as a general matter, but- Great transition. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3748.96s)]
*  Thank you. But I suspect many of them were still saddened to hear the news that King Charles has [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3750.72s)]
*  been diagnosed with some type of cancer. Come on. So I guess he was being treated for an enlarged [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3755.12s)]
*  prostate when doctors discovered some cancer elsewhere in his body. We don't know exactly [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3760.56s)]
*  what's going on, but to King Charles' credit, he went public with this news in an effort to [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3764.64s)]
*  encourage others to get screenings. In the past, royal health news has kind of stayed within the [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3770.08s)]
*  palace and not necessarily been public. So good on him for going public with this. You don't have [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3775.7599999999998s)]
*  to be a monarch fan to know that it's actually a good thing if you have to have a monarch to have [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3781.28s)]
*  one who's like really, really interested in combating climate change, for example, which [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3786.48s)]
*  King Charles is. So I think, you know, he can be a force for good if he wants to be. I'm not saying [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3790.32s)]
*  I'm like a pro-monarchy guy in any way. Charles, yeah. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3794.48s)]
*  God damn it. No, you're right. You're right. I mean, [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3797.52s)]
*  like he, like there's a lot, the monarchy we can talk about and Charles has had some hiccups along [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3798.7200000000003s)]
*  the way. There's, you know, but- Hiccups. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3803.0400000000004s)]
*  But as a, as a public figure, like he's embraced climate change, he's embraced kind of mental [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3805.52s)]
*  health, he's embracing health transparency. That's good. And frankly, it's just a human, [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3809.76s)]
*  like seriously, like, you know, Kate, you know, just had some nasty health bout, you know, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3814.1600000000003s)]
*  she was hospitalized for a while. Now Charles, it is, you know, it's been a rough year for the [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3819.2000000000003s)]
*  royals. I mean, I genuinely mean that. I mean, Queen Elizabeth dying and now all these health [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3824.0800000000004s)]
*  issues. I saw, rural correspondent of me saw that Harry is going to see his father. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3828.5600000000004s)]
*  Flying back to see dad. Yeah. So who knows? Maybe we'll get a [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3833.36s)]
*  reconciliation. Which honestly makes me a little worried about what the prognosis is, [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3835.44s)]
*  right? If you like jump on a plane and immediately fly home, that makes you worry. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3839.44s)]
*  It's kind of serious. That's true actually. And that like, yeah, [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3843.12s)]
*  I really hope that's not the case. And, and I was going to say something about another season [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3845.6s)]
*  in the crown, but now I realized that that's probably important. Yeah, you do you. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3850.8s)]
*  Last segment, we're going to do a little something called conservative politicians are weird. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3854.48s)]
*  So this is according to a report in the Sunday Times, Ben, British prime minister Rishi Sunak [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3858.56s)]
*  fasts for 36 hours at the start of every single week. He only drinks water, tea or black coffee [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3863.6s)]
*  from 5 PM on Sunday to 5 AM on Tuesday. Obviously when you are starving, your body breaks down fat [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3869.52s)]
*  and not energy or carbohydrates. Some people think this diet helps you live longer, but that [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3877.12s)]
*  science is like based on starving mice and shit. So I don't know. All I know is that like, first of [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3883.44s)]
*  all, Rishi Sunak, like you're kind of a bean pole. So I don't know that you need to be starving [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3889.12s)]
*  yourself for 36 hours. But also if I fasted for 16 hours, let alone 36, I would be in the worst [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3892.88s)]
*  mood imaginable. I can't even imagine doing that. Well, you know, you, you know, you should have some [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3900.7200000000003s)]
*  of that, like, uh, what are we used to endorse the athletic greens? Yeah. Can you have that? [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3904.8s)]
*  I don't know if that sounds like you're cheating. That is part of, I guess that's not tea. I, I'd [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3910.8s)]
*  add to the weird Rishi Sunak and British toy segment too, that you see the like thousand pound [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3914.7200000000003s)]
*  bet that Piers Morgan made with him about whether any planes would go to Rwanda. Like it [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3920.4s)]
*  is very odd to see like a prime minister like shaking hands to bet Piers Morgan a thousand [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3925.84s)]
*  pounds about sending people to Rwanda. Was it Mitt Romney who bet somebody like $10,000? [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3930.88s)]
*  You try to bet someone $10,000 on stage during a debate. Yeah. He tried to bet, uh, that idiot, [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3937.6800000000003s)]
*  Rick Perry. Listen, when you're a fucking rich dude, rich, exactly. I had a touch, [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3943.76s)]
*  the half a billionaire. Don't bet someone a thousand pounds. If you are Rishi Sunak, [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3950.6400000000003s)]
*  who's half a billionaire and who presides over a party that has fucking destroyed the NHS national [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3956.0800000000004s)]
*  service through austerity, maybe you don't just like drop a thousand pound bets on whether you [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3962.7200000000003s)]
*  can send some migrants on a plane to Rwanda. You can send some, like some destitute people [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3968.1600000000003s)]
*  fleeing persecution, whether you can send them to a country they've never been to, never heard [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3973.44s)]
*  of. Don't speak the language and don't own it. Hey, I bet you a thousand dollars. I can torture [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3977.68s)]
*  these people before the election. This is the kind of thing that I see. And I kind of like, [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3982.0s)]
*  it'd be fun to be in the labor campaign. Oh my God. I would just destroy him for this. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3985.68s)]
*  Cause he's such a big, easy, skinny target. Like a big target, you know, like. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3989.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. So stick sticking with this theme then, uh, former British prime minister, [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3994.64s)]
*  Liz Truss is speaking at CPAC this year. So for those who don't know CPAC stands for the [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=3998.96s)]
*  conservative political action conference. It is this far right conference that Republicans host. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4003.6s)]
*  It was once like kind of fringe and wacky, kind of like the bar scene from star wars, [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4009.36s)]
*  the Republican party showing up or something. Yeah. Now it's like MAGA centrist, right? It's [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4014.16s)]
*  just kind of like the Trump show. Um, I I'm kind of interested to see how this goes because I'm [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4018.8s)]
*  not sure that these little like culture war freaks want to hear from a boring loser who [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4023.92s)]
*  was prime minister for 50 days before being bounced out of office. Like I don't know. That's [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4030.0s)]
*  not like the kind of leadership they're looking for down at CPAC. Yeah. Why is she, what I guess [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4035.12s)]
*  she wanted to cut taxes a lot. So they like her. I mean, I just don't understand. Like what is the [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4041.84s)]
*  appeal when you're, when you're in the CPAC meeting, okay, let's put ourselves in the, [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4046.7200000000003s)]
*  whatever brainstorm, you know, and you're going through all the list of potential speakers and [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4050.96s)]
*  it's kind of like, uh, the doctor evil headquarters, yeah. Yeah. Awesome powers. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4055.52s)]
*  Or like, all right, we got Dan bond. You know, or deep call back like the naked gun opening, [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4059.92s)]
*  you know, okay. Yeah. Like, but there, yeah, you've got a wall with all the potential speakers and [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4063.92s)]
*  you're like, we got Orban over here and Don jr. Bukele making an appearance. If we ask them, [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4067.68s)]
*  and is there some like, like right wing, like RSS, like a Hindu nationalist, [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4072.32s)]
*  we want to come speak or something like, like you have all these people to choose from Ben [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4077.52s)]
*  Gavir Ben Gavir. Who was at that neo Nazi meeting in Eastern Germany that caused all that trouble. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4081.28s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I get one of them. Like, uh, you know, why would you basically like, yeah, actually the [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4085.76s)]
*  person we wanted Liz trust. Yeah. Maybe a decade ago you're like, oh, there's some prestige from a [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4090.08s)]
*  former prime minister, but like you got Trump, you got Orban. I'm sure you got Nigel Farage. I'm sure [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4094.96s)]
*  he's going to be there. Bolsonaro probably be there. I'll be there like spreading COVID. You know, [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4099.68s)]
*  I mean, the serious part of this is there is this just like connective tissue between all these [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4103.92s)]
*  like sort of fringe, super right wing nationalists, usually racist leaders. I mean, Liz trust that I'm [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4108.4800000000005s)]
*  not saying that she was specifically racist. I've talked about some of the others at CPAC, but she [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4115.52s)]
*  was just kind of ridiculous. She's just an idiot. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She's put forward a tax plan [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4118.96s)]
*  and it tanked the entire economy. That's almost broke the bank of England. It's like wild, wild [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4122.32s)]
*  story. But yeah, I mean, I guess she's been spotted in Congress. I think she's having meetings with [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4126.88s)]
*  tea party types. I think the extreme tax cut caucus like like circus, she was willing to break [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4131.52s)]
*  the global economy to cut taxes, I guess. I don't know. Bizarre. Very strange. All right. Well, [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4138.160000000001s)]
*  that's enough of, you know, weirdo conservative Tories, but we're going to take a quick break. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4142.4800000000005s)]
*  When we come back, we're going to hear from Alex Ward. He's a writer for Politico and the author [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4147.200000000001s)]
*  of the new book, The Internationalist, which is about President Biden's first two years in office [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4150.56s)]
*  and his foreign policies. Stick around for that. Alex Ward is a writer for Politico and the author [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4155.040000000001s)]
*  of the new book, The Internationalist, which chronicles the first two years of President Biden's [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4159.28s)]
*  foreign policy and administration. Alex, welcome to the show. Yeah. Thanks for having me, Tony. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4164.08s)]
*  I need to first admit that you do an excellent national security newsletter for Politico. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4168.48s)]
*  How often does it come out again? I just I read it every time, but yeah, it's Wednesday through [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4174.16s)]
*  Friday, 4 p.m. Eastern. So it's a it's a big project that we do every day. Nothing is more [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4177.92s)]
*  helpful for me in producing the show and the team here. So thank you for that. But let's talk about [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4183.04s)]
*  the book. You finished this deep dive into President Biden's foreign policy in the first [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4188.4s)]
*  two years of the administration. Was there anything you learned reporting out the book [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4192.639999999999s)]
*  that surprised you or was different from, you know, things you'd taken away from just sort of [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4197.12s)]
*  day to day reporting those first couple of years? And at the risk of asking a question that used to [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4201.5199999999995s)]
*  drive me insane when I was a spokesperson in government, did you come away feeling like there [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4206.16s)]
*  was a Biden doctrine when it comes to foreign policy? I think what surprised me most is that [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4210.799999999999s)]
*  there was a lot of Trumpism that was brought in to abide in foreign policy, right? Because Biden, [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4216.32s)]
*  you know, three years old in World War Two ended. He is an avatar for the traditional democratic [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4222.4s)]
*  foreign policy world, liberal international order, defense of democracy, that kind of thing. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4227.759999999999s)]
*  And Trump wins in 2016. And the team around him, mostly Jake Sullivan, the national security [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4233.04s)]
*  adviser, go, wait a minute. Trump did not necessarily win on his foreign policy views, [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4238.24s)]
*  but he didn't lose on them either, that there's clearly something in that thinking and in the [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4243.28s)]
*  stuff that he was promoting, that the traditional foreign policy folks on the democratic side and [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4248.96s)]
*  the republican side had not internalized and not considered. And so thanks to Sullivan and others, [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4254.4s)]
*  Ben, we should note, national security action, helped develop this framework. And even though, [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4260.8s)]
*  especially Ben may not like my saying that a bit of Trumpism got in, let's say a bit of [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4266.96s)]
*  focus on the domestic front, a bit of populism got it and thinking about, okay, [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4271.04s)]
*  you can still defend democracy, you can still uphold the international order, but maybe it [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4275.5199999999995s)]
*  needs a reframing, maybe it needs a bit of renewing in order to matter to people, which is why the [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4279.04s)]
*  moniker you constantly hear from Team Biden is a foreign policy for the middle class. Now, [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4283.92s)]
*  is that the doctrine? I don't think it is. I would say the doctrine is more along the lines of [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4288.56s)]
*  the absolute prioritization of the defense of the liberal international order of democracies and [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4294.16s)]
*  democracy at home and abroad, but with the twist of reframing it so it can last and not crack under [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4301.76s)]
*  the populist pressure that Trump and others have been putting on it. I want to talk more about that, [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4309.44s)]
*  the fight for democracy in some of those bigger picture themes here. But some of the chapters [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4314.24s)]
*  that really were searing for me to read were about the Afghanistan withdrawal and those last few [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4319.68s)]
*  weeks and days and just how horrifying it was, most of all, obviously for the people of Afghanistan, [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4325.6s)]
*  but also this was clearly a scarring experience for the administration officials involved in [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4330.72s)]
*  Afghanistan policy or in the White House generally. How do you think that period of time and that [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4336.64s)]
*  outcome impacted Biden's decision making going forward? Quite significantly. I mean, look, [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4342.0s)]
*  we should note that Biden in the moment of deciding to withdraw through now stands by the [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4347.68s)]
*  decision despite all the chaos around and the fact that 13 service members were killed in the [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4355.4400000000005s)]
*  terrorist attack outside of Kabul's airport. But what I think happened is that Team Biden, [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4360.72s)]
*  more than Biden himself, were like, wait a minute, we got kind of flat-footed here. Yes, [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4367.12s)]
*  we made a decision, but look at how quickly the Taliban stormed to power. Look at how chaotic [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4370.96s)]
*  this withdrawal turned out to be. Look at the optics of it. Even if you can still agree with [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4375.36s)]
*  the strategic decision overall, maybe tactically it led to some problems. So there was a sense [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4380.4s)]
*  within Team Biden to kind of go, okay, well, we need to prove ourselves again and we need to [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4387.759999999999s)]
*  internalize a lot of these things that we learned or rather unlearned from the Afghanistan situation [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4391.28s)]
*  and apply it to some future crisis. Unfortunately, in world politics, that's when Putin was basically [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4397.92s)]
*  starting to think about taking Ukraine. And so if there was a lick the wounds moment, it didn't last [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4406.64s)]
*  long because they had to quickly go, okay, well, what did we mess up in terms of our processes and [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4411.92s)]
*  thinking? And how can we switch that quickly to apply to, of course, a wholly different situation, [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4417.6s)]
*  which is Russia-Ukraine? Yeah, I mean, on the decision itself, I mean, my view on Biden's [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4422.16s)]
*  decision to end the war is that it was the right one. And I also think that the responsibility [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4426.24s)]
*  for the outcome in some of the images we saw in the horrifying images at the end, [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4431.599999999999s)]
*  the responsibility for those lie with every administration, Bush, Obama, Trump, Biden, [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4437.12s)]
*  Trump in particular, like cut the withdrawal deal, right? He all but shut down the processing of [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4442.24s)]
*  visas for Afghans who worked with the US military, the SIV visas, which made it so hard to ramp that [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4446.4s)]
*  process back up at the end. So I get all that. And I'm like, I think Biden deserves some of the [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4452.16s)]
*  blame, but certainly not all of it. And I say that as someone with humility who worked on this policy. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4457.84s)]
*  At the same time, I did feel like in those final weeks, the administration's response to questions [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4462.24s)]
*  about the withdrawal were very defensive. They primarily focused on this being the largest [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4469.28s)]
*  airlift of people in history and not on the fact that it wasn't necessarily all the people we [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4475.28s)]
*  wanted to get out who were getting out, right? Like a lot of like SIV visa holders were left behind. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4481.52s)]
*  Did that kind of defensive crouch change over time as you revisited this in your reporting [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4487.120000000001s)]
*  and went back to the same people like six months or a year later to talk about that time? [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4493.040000000001s)]
*  No, I mean, look, they gave me the kind of this feeling you did, which is look, Alex, you can hold [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4497.200000000001s)]
*  two thoughts in your head. This is the most impressive logistical moment, arguably in modern [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4501.76s)]
*  military history in terms of airlifting all these people out. What a coordinated feat this was, [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4508.88s)]
*  considering all the chaos that was surrounding Kabul and Afghanistan. And also, yes, we can [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4515.36s)]
*  recognize that there was humanitarian tragedy, but they would say after 20 years of war, what did you [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4519.84s)]
*  expect? Like, did you expect this to go cleanly? And I think those are generally two fair arguments. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4525.84s)]
*  What I would say though, and what I try to write out in the book is that there was a very important [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4530.8s)]
*  baked in assumption in the decision to withdraw. And that was that it would take 18 to 24 months [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4535.84s)]
*  for the Taliban to take Kabul and effectively control all of Afghanistan. So because of that, [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4540.64s)]
*  I don't want to say the administration slow walked moves on SIVs or getting folks out. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4546.16s)]
*  And in fact, it's hard to say that because the military was like, if you're getting us out, [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4551.28s)]
*  speed of safety, we're moving. Right. You know, the White House was sort of taken [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4554.64s)]
*  back by how quickly that military withdrawal took. But anyway, to the main point, [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4558.56s)]
*  18 to 24 months was how much time they basically thought they had to produce as orderly an exit [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4563.44s)]
*  as possible. The fact that it crashed down on them so quickly, they had to improvise. They [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4569.759999999999s)]
*  improvised, I think you can say relatively well based on the airlift and all that. But there's no [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4573.2s)]
*  question that that improvisation and forced upon them led to a chaotic withdrawal process where [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4579.12s)]
*  those who are actually in Kabul having to make decisions on like life or death decisions, quite [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4587.759999999999s)]
*  literally, you know, had to do it on the fly that you saw the death of the service members and you [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4591.36s)]
*  saw just the general humanitarian devastation outside the airport. So was there going to be [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4595.759999999999s)]
*  an orderly and good quote unquote withdrawal of Afghanistan? No. Did it have to be as bad? No, [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4600.08s)]
*  I don't think so either. Yeah, I think if you gave President Biden truth serum and said knowing what [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4604.639999999999s)]
*  you know now, would you have pushed to withdraw four or five, six months to get all the SIVs out? [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4608.32s)]
*  I'm sure he'd say yes. The very hard thing, I think, for you for writing a book like this in [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4613.5199999999995s)]
*  the middle of a term is that events change. And in this case, you know, you finished the book before [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4618.8s)]
*  the October 7th attacks and before things started to go pretty badly in Ukraine. Do those events and [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4624.08s)]
*  changes kind of make you rethink anything you wrote? Or how has that sort of impacted your view of the [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4630.64s)]
*  Biden foreign policy since? Yeah, whenever the paper book comes out, I'm gonna have to probably [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4635.92s)]
*  write a new epilogue. Forward, yeah. Forward, forward. So yeah, look, I mean, I think it's [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4639.52s)]
*  true that when the time I finished writing the book, which was roughly the February of last year, [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4646.08s)]
*  things were looking really up, right? I mean, you had Ukraine was defended. These side issues [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4651.2s)]
*  that the Biden administration would put it, which at the time would have been the Israeli-Palestinian [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4659.04s)]
*  conflict. Those were still quiet. I mean, just even before October 7th, you had Jake Sullivan [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4662.0s)]
*  say, you know, things are quiet in the Middle East. Like, that's how they were thinking about it. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4666.639999999999s)]
*  That's how they were feeling. And so there was a bit of optimism, like, OK, we got through this [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4669.44s)]
*  period. The West has stood up. Here we go. It hasn't gone as well. Of course, the counteroffensive [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4673.28s)]
*  shortly afterward did not work as planned. So, you know, Biden's sort of like campaign rally for [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4680.24s)]
*  NATO in Eastern Europe, you know, sort of did not go as hoped in Warsaw and, of course, later in [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4686.48s)]
*  NATO in Lithuania. And then, you know, Israel Hamas pops up and you have one of the core assumptions [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4692.48s)]
*  of Bidenism or a Biden doctrine, which was we can put these, not unimportant, but in terms of the [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4700.4s)]
*  main things they care about, side issues, we can keep them quiet throughout so we can focus on the [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4708.08s)]
*  core things. That assumption proved relatively untrue, of course, because now it's dominating [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4712.719999999999s)]
*  the entire agenda and threatening, you know, to destabilize quite a bit. Now you hear Team Biden [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4717.5199999999995s)]
*  now say, well, we've always cared about the Israeli-Palestinian issue. This was something [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4723.759999999999s)]
*  that we were working on throughout, you know, as part of Abraham Accords, etc. I think you kind of [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4727.6s)]
*  have to call BS on that a bit. There's no question that they cared about it in the months leading up [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4732.96s)]
*  to October 7th as they were doing the Israeli-Saudi normalization deal, right? Part of that deal had to [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4738.160000000001s)]
*  be not concessions, but some improvements for the Palestinian cause. But that, again, only a couple [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4743.76s)]
*  months before October 7th, for the majority of the time of this administration, this was a totally [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4751.200000000001s)]
*  backburner issue. Yeah, I mean, it just shows any... You can go into a presidency with a doctrine [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4756.08s)]
*  or an idea for what you want to do, but events are always going to happen and overtake those things. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4760.88s)]
*  The book made me think a lot about my time in government because you really got into the [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4765.5199999999995s)]
*  details of what the NSC does. And when I was in government, there's so much focus on inputs, [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4770.16s)]
*  basically like things we're doing versus outcomes. What I mean by that is like, you total up the [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4776.48s)]
*  number of meetings you had on an issue or diplomatic touches with foreign counterparts [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4781.92s)]
*  about something, and you use those as evidence that we're on top of things, but not necessarily [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4786.88s)]
*  the outcomes themselves, right? For an example would be the Russian invasion of Ukraine, [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4792.4800000000005s)]
*  the Biden administration, they released intelligence. There were these Tiger team meetings [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4796.88s)]
*  to plan for what might happen. There's lots of coordination among allies. All of that made it a [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4801.04s)]
*  lot easier to respond quickly once the invasion happened, but it didn't prevent it. How do you [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4805.92s)]
*  think you judge the efficacy of an administration when you're looking at the inputs versus the [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4812.56s)]
*  outcomes, while also knowing that obviously the US can't control all events around the world? We [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4818.24s)]
*  don't get to tell Vladimir Putin what to do, for example. Yeah, one of the quotes that I most [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4823.2s)]
*  remember in doing this book, and I should have committed to memory, but paraphrasing was effectively [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4826.96s)]
*  this, which was, we did this about as perfectly as we could do it, and we still failed. I remember [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4831.2s)]
*  that, yeah. Right? When the person I talked to told me that, I was like, man, that must just suck. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4836.0s)]
*  You did about as, and I would give the administration credit, I think they did about [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4843.36s)]
*  as well as any administration could do in an attempt to prevent something like this. They [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4847.599999999999s)]
*  were even open to diplomatic negotiations with Putin over some sacred cows, including NATO [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4852.8s)]
*  enlargement or Ukraine's position in moving further westward. There were genuine conversations and [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4857.6s)]
*  tough conversations with European allies, with Zelensky himself, who we must remember, [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4864.96s)]
*  was pretty brutal with the US and critical for saying, you guys are out of control. This is not [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4871.040000000001s)]
*  going to happen. You don't know the Russians like we do. So when you consider the fact that the [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4876.88s)]
*  administration helped, effectively warned the world that this was happening, warned Ukraine that this [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4880.8s)]
*  was happening, set up a sanctions regime, convinced some skeptical Europeans to go pretty hard on [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4886.48s)]
*  Europe, that they were willing to talk with Russia and make some sort of deal, but basically caught [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4892.16s)]
*  trying because no one expected Putin to actually make a move. But regardless, they got everything [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4898.32s)]
*  in train. They got everything prepared. They got the intelligence. They warned the world. They [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4904.16s)]
*  changed an intelligence practice to declassify information and explain what was going on. I mean, [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4908.32s)]
*  it was a pretty good response that unfortunately did not lead to its intended goal. Now, [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4912.96s)]
*  there are the critics who would say, well, the big mistake team Biden did was not sanction Russia [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4922.24s)]
*  early or send weapons early. That would have been a deterrent. Of course, the Biden administration's [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4926.56s)]
*  plan was, well, that if you do the thing, then you're no longer deterring. Then Russia's already [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4931.36s)]
*  punished and they're going to do it anyway. We can't change the past. We don't know if that would [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4936.0s)]
*  have worked. But I think outside of that, knowing what we know, I've talked to no one really that [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4940.0s)]
*  thinks that it was a bad response. It's just if Putin's going to do it, Putin's going to do it. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4947.2s)]
*  Yeah. I find it very hard to believe that some sanctions or sending a thousand Javelin missiles [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4951.04s)]
*  in advance of the invasion would have deterred Putin when he wanted to take Ukraine. It was [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4955.76s)]
*  interesting remembering how challenging the US-Ukraine relation was, particularly relations [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4960.96s)]
*  between Zelensky and Biden in advance of the invasion, how much the administration was trying [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4969.04s)]
*  to convince Zelensky that his country was about to be invaded and he just wouldn't believe them. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4975.2s)]
*  Either he genuinely didn't believe them or he just didn't want to believe them. I can't really tell. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4981.6s)]
*  I don't know if you know, but that period of the relationship feels like it's been forgotten at [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4986.08s)]
*  this point. Yeah. If there's anything scoopier newsy in the book, I think there's a lot of bits, [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4991.76s)]
*  but one of the sort of bigger thematic ones is we all knew that the US-Ukraine relationship was [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=4996.72s)]
*  tense. I don't think we knew it was this bad. That's what the book tries to chronicle. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5002.16s)]
*  Biden and Zelensky were in yelling matches at some points. It was really, really bad. There was a [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5006.240000000001s)]
*  moment where Biden was basically telling Zelensky, defend your city, defend your country, mobilize. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5010.8s)]
*  What are you doing? I was not able to talk to many Ukrainians for this book. That's one of my [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5016.08s)]
*  regrets. The folks I did talk to and those who were close to the Ukrainians, [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5022.4s)]
*  it's not that there was necessarily a political ploy. There was, of course, a political element to [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5028.5599999999995s)]
*  not saying we're about to get invaded because it's bad for the economy and all that. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5032.4s)]
*  But there really was a sense that you Americans, your intelligence about war is constantly wrong. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5035.679999999999s)]
*  We know the Russians better than you do and they wouldn't do this. They've already invaded us. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5041.92s)]
*  They're not going to go all out. That would be stupid. For Biden and, of course, other officials [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5046.24s)]
*  to come out and say, here's intelligence, here's what the Russians are planning. We're warning the [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5052.0s)]
*  world, Ukraine, be careful, Putin, be careful. Zelensky's like, stop doing that. Stop doing it. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5056.0s)]
*  It was rancorous. I should say, nothing sharpens the mind more than an invasion because the moment [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5063.76s)]
*  Russia got in, Zelensky was like, all right, send me weapons, send me money. What can we do? This is [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5068.56s)]
*  happening. Of course, his tune changed and he's led a phenomenal defense of his nation. But [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5073.2s)]
*  in the walk up, he was about as skeptical as anybody that was going to happen. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5080.72s)]
*  Yeah. And I guess in his defense, I mean, you look at the intelligence around the Iraq war, [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5084.48s)]
*  you look at the intelligence around the Afghan withdrawal, it's understandable that he might [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5087.6s)]
*  question the products at that point. But that said, the intelligence was like 100,000 troops [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5091.44s)]
*  on the border. So it was a little more obvious that he was planning an invasion of some sort. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5097.44s)]
*  Last question for you. When I was in government, there were lots of great people I worked with, [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5102.72s)]
*  well-meaning people who would earnestly, but I think a little performatively say, [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5107.2s)]
*  politics has no place in the situation room, which of course is patently ridiculous. The only reason [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5111.12s)]
*  we all were allowed in that room is because Barack Obama was elected president. So politics [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5116.16s)]
*  is inextricably linked to everything you do, foreign policy included. I was wondering, [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5120.5599999999995s)]
*  the folks you talked to in the Biden administration, how they feel about how politics [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5127.2s)]
*  is impacting their ability to do the things they want to do these days. Because if the book ends, [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5133.36s)]
*  America is ready for renewal, the world was there to remake, there are at least two more years to [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5138.24s)]
*  get it done. Early on, Republicans were playing ball on some of those renewal efforts. Now they [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5142.16s)]
*  are absolutely not, including aid for Ukraine, other things that were seen as bipartisan in the [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5147.759999999999s)]
*  past. So I'm wondering how politics is now in the minds of someone like Jake Sullivan, who's trying [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5153.599999999999s)]
*  to run the foreign policy apparatus. Yeah. I can't say I spoke to them directly on this question, [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5159.12s)]
*  but I have an informed guess, which was, in the first year or two, the assumption was, [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5162.64s)]
*  if we connect politics to foreign policy, because again, implicit in foreign policy for the middle [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5169.200000000001s)]
*  classes, you are doing something for the American people, ergo, it will be popular. So there's no [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5174.240000000001s)]
*  question there's a domestic political part here. So I think they felt that in the first two years [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5179.360000000001s)]
*  or so, if there was success in Ukraine, if we got Afghanistan and things were all right, if we [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5184.8s)]
*  righted the relationship with China, if we focused on climate change and that kind of thing, [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5191.2s)]
*  that eventually the people would go, our lives are better, America's in this better place. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5195.679999999999s)]
*  And then there would be, let's say, more popularity or more support for buying foreign policy, [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5200.96s)]
*  because it could be working. And one could argue that roughly around the time I stopped writing [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5205.36s)]
*  this book, they had that moment, they kind of were there. I mean, granted, politics are what they are, [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5208.96s)]
*  there will always be critics among Republicans. And I'm not saying it's a perfect foreign policy [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5213.92s)]
*  by any means. But I think that was the level of optimism that they felt and that I was picking [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5217.44s)]
*  up on when I tried to write it. Now, I don't think anyone's there. And of course, at the moment that [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5222.08s)]
*  we're chatting, it looks like this border deal Ukraine thing is done. So we're now in the grind [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5226.16s)]
*  moment, the 2024 election moment. And what's fascinating to me is, as Biden and likely Trump [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5234.5599999999995s)]
*  comes up, Biden was really planning to go on the strength of his foreign policy. And look what we [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5240.48s)]
*  did. Look how we saved America after what Trump did to us in the world. That's their thinking. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5244.64s)]
*  And now it's not so clear he has that advantage. And now that that debate has now turned into [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5250.400000000001s)]
*  visions of the world and what way America should go. And it's turned into who won't start World War [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5257.4400000000005s)]
*  Three. Yeah, I think unfortunately, foreign policy has turned into a challenging position for Biden [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5263.280000000001s)]
*  vis-a-vis Trump, because the things that actually break through in the press are events like the [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5268.400000000001s)]
*  Afghanistan withdrawal and people have a negative opinion of those. But I also think that there was [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5273.68s)]
*  an NBC poll the other day that talked about who is better Trump or Biden on improving America [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5277.92s)]
*  standing in the world. And Trump was up 11 points. That might just be like when your approval is [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5284.16s)]
*  underwater, your approval is underwater across a whole host of issues. But it doesn't make it feel [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5290.0s)]
*  like foreign policy is a real wind at their back at the moment, in particular with Gaza and what [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5295.360000000001s)]
*  it's doing to the Democratic Party. Yeah. If I recall, and I don't have polls in front of me, [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5299.52s)]
*  if I recall that Biden had stronger numbers on that aspect in general, not necessarily against [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5302.96s)]
*  Trump, but just in general, far before Israel Hamas. So this is very much a fact again. And I [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5307.36s)]
*  should note, Biden's numbers sunk pretty strongly around the Afghanistan withdrawal. So it's one of [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5315.04s)]
*  those things, there's a maxim in foreign policy that foreign policy can't make a presidency, [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5320.72s)]
*  but it can break one. And in this case, you could argue that Biden did a lot of great things, [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5324.72s)]
*  is the liberal international order more secure? You can make that case. Is West more rallied [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5332.080000000001s)]
*  together and united? You could make that case. Has climate change been prioritized as an issue [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5337.040000000001s)]
*  slightly, but you can make that case. But when most people think of Biden's foreign policy, [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5342.320000000001s)]
*  my guess is they go Afghanistan withdrawal and Israel Hamas, and those aren't good stories to [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5347.200000000001s)]
*  tell. Yeah. The good news is there's some time to fix that and to write the ship there. But yeah, [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5350.72s)]
*  at the moment, I think it's a bit of an idea. But Alex, thank you so much for talking with me. The [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5355.52s)]
*  book is The Internationalist. Everyone should go pick it up now. It's coming out what? A couple [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5360.0s)]
*  days? About a week? February 20th. Yeah. Excellent. Well, everyone should check it out and check out [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5363.36s)]
*  all the writing you're doing over at Politico because you guys do great work. And thanks for [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5369.12s)]
*  helping us produce the show. Thanks for having me, Sonic. I'll look forward to my residual checks. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5373.04s)]
*  Yeah, here you go. Thanks again to Alex Squire for joining the show. And that's all I got. Thanks to [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5377.04s)]
*  Liz Truss. Thanks to Liz. And Regis Sunak is always hanging out in Santa Monica, so I'm surprised we [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5382.24s)]
*  haven't seen him. I'm going to miss Regis Sunak when he's defeated because he's actually turned [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5387.2s)]
*  out to be good content. He will probably end up living out here and he will probably at some point [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5391.2s)]
*  through an intermediary ask you for a meeting. And his life will be really good. The thing about [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5394.88s)]
*  Regis, he'll be rich guy. He's a smart guy. He'll probably get into tech or something and make gobs [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5399.92s)]
*  of money. Tons of cash. Yeah. He'll probably be on this podcast, actually. He'll be a VC. We had [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5406.5599999999995s)]
*  David Cameron on the podcast. Yeah. Regis, come on. Who kind of is on the world stage now looking [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5410.16s)]
*  like the prime minister and it's got a piss Sunak off. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's not going wrong. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5415.12s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He floated that they were going to recognize Palestinian state at the UN and then [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5419.44s)]
*  he'd walk it back. Yeah. The Cameron declaration. Yeah. Tough. Tough. Like the Balfour. Okay. That's [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5424.48s)]
*  enough for us. Talk to you next week. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtmvjZo0jxI&t=5429.84s)]
