# Trump Discusses Keeping ‘Secret Information’ About Iran in Leaked Audio
**Pod Save the World:** [June 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k)
*  Welcome back to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Ben Rhodes. Ben, long time no see. How you doing? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=0.0s)]
*  It's been a couple days. Feels like a while ago though. The [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4.96s)]
*  The coup sorted itself out a little bit faster than people thought. Yeah, the coup kind of tapered out quickly [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=8.76s)]
*  Although there's some weird stuff still happening that I think we will get to today [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=13.88s)]
*  So, you know folks who don't know we're talking about we recorded a special episode on Saturday about this ongoing [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=18.16s)]
*  Wagner insurrection that was happening in Russia today. We're gonna talk about the latest news there [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=23.96s)]
*  We'll also talk about the latest on Ukraine's counteroffensive this jaw-dropping new audio tape of Trump [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=30.04s)]
*  Leaking classified information in the most brazen way possible [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=36.6s)]
*  We're gonna talk about India exporting its attacks on journalists the United States [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=40.32s)]
*  Whether Chinese President Xi Jinping is a dictator the sinking of a boat off the coast of Greece that killed hundreds of migrants [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=44.24s)]
*  News from Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu's corruption trial and presidential candidate Francis Suarez shows his foreign policy chops [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=50.64s)]
*  Ben and then I just talked with a reporter named Evan Novi Williams from Sportico [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=58.56s)]
*  It's a great news out that the covers business and sports together [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=63.64s)]
*  they have the scoop about Qatar their sovereign wealth fund buying a piece of three DC based professional sports teams and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=66.76s)]
*  Great interview Ben, but I think sports washing is winning the battle, man [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=75.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you know, we have a pretty good track record of being slightly obsessed with both sports washing and the Wagner group [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=79.4s)]
*  Over the last couple years in this podcast, so not sure what that says about us, but [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=85.58s)]
*  At least we're close to this guy guys. Yeah. Yeah some some sort of nerdy Cassandra vibes going on [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=90.5s)]
*  All right. Let's go to Russia because you know on Saturday we released this episode about the mutiny those unfolding this oligarch name [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=96.86s)]
*  Evgeny pregoz in seemingly lost his mind started marching 25,000 heavily armed private militia members towards Moscow [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=103.46000000000001s)]
*  This is the Wagner group [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=110.7s)]
*  Pregozian eventually stood down after taking a call from Alexander Lukashenko the president of Belarus who offered him exile and amnesty for his fighters [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=112.06s)]
*  On Moscow, Belarusian state media reported that pregozian had arrived there. He's in Minsk now, I guess [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=119.58s)]
*  After initially seemed to flee Moscow for st [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=125.46s)]
*  Petersburg Russian president Vladimir Putin came out of hiding [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=128.22s)]
*  He did two heavily scripted little media events where he denounced the mutiny called pregozian a traitor and held a moment of silence for the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=131.57999999999998s)]
*  Russian military pilots killed in the fighting with Wagner forces the Wagner guys shot down. I think a couple helicopters pretty intense stuff [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=138.82s)]
*  Putin also announced that the Russian state had been funding the Wagner group [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=147.66s)]
*  That is interesting because until very recently almost everyone involved with Wagner basically denied its existence [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=152.1s)]
*  pregozian used to sue people for reporting on his connections with Wagner [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=157.89999999999998s)]
*  Then it seems increasingly likely that this whole ordeal was not about a Russian military airstrike on Wagner forces [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=162.42s)]
*  But rather the result of pregozian feeling squeezed out of power from Putin's inner circle in particular by this Russian Defense Ministry [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=169.22s)]
*  Ordered that by the end of June all Wagner forces would have to sign a contract with the Ministry of Defense pledging allegiance [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=176.85999999999999s)]
*  To the Russian military leadership [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=183.7s)]
*  Putin supported this plan the plan basically would have stripped away all pregozian's power and gave it to his archenemy [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=185.98s)]
*  Sergey Shoigu the defense minister. So Ben, I'm curious why you think [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=191.5s)]
*  Putin came out and made this announcement about Russia paying the Wagner group and if there's any other development since we talked Saturday that you think [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=196.45999999999998s)]
*  Jumped out at you or felt particularly relevant [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=204.26s)]
*  well, I think what's clear is that there's this effort now to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=206.42s)]
*  Kind of rewrite the narrative of what happened by Putin [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=209.98s)]
*  And so after this deal was announced, you know surely before our last podcast [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=213.26s)]
*  There was this kind of 24 hours where there wasn't much information [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=218.14s)]
*  Everybody's gonna quiet everybody's kind of induct and cover mode and then over the course of the last 24 hours [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=220.82s)]
*  We've seen Putin come out with these statements. We've seen [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=226.14s)]
*  Alexander Lukashenko the person who was kind of in the middle of I don't know negotiating this or at least being the front man for [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=230.34s)]
*  The deal that was struck between pregozian and the Russians [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=237.86s)]
*  Gave like a multi-hour press conference about Max said it was eight hours [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=241.11999999999998s)]
*  I don't know if he was kidding or not, but it was like it looked brutal [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=245.51999999999998s)]
*  It wasn't quite that long, but you know, it had some serious like Sasha Baron Cohen dictator vibes there [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=248.04s)]
*  But but look I think what so what can we learn from the narrative that Putin's trying to put out? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=253.39999999999998s)]
*  And what do we think happened? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean, I think what we can learn from the narrative Putin's trying to put out is he's trying to signal [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=259.28s)]
*  I'm in charge of all this. I was never really in any peril. I've been in charge all along of the Wagner group [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=263.03999999999996s)]
*  I was the guy paying their bills [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=269.68s)]
*  I was in charge of this plan to kind of absorb them and integrate them into the Ministry of Defense [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=271.08s)]
*  Sure got a little bumpy there for you know [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=276.88s)]
*  The mutiny and military rebellion that the whole world saw for 24 to 48 hours [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=279.36s)]
*  But kind of nothing to see there nothing to worry about pregozian. He's a traitor. He's kind of on the outs [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=284.0s)]
*  he's in Minsk and and we're just moving forward and I [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=288.92s)]
*  See and that's kind of the narrative that you know [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=293.52s)]
*  Apparently is kind of filtering out through Russian state television [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=296.06s)]
*  There's a real problem [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=298.72s)]
*  Pause on this and you and I were texting about this [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=301.0s)]
*  But you know as someone had to kind of do cable news to like there's some people zagging [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=303.5s)]
*  After all the kind of hyper ventilating about the coup some people are like, well, maybe this you know [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=307.44s)]
*  Wasn't that bad for Putin and maybe you know [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=312.16s)]
*  look [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=314.76s)]
*  This doesn't happen in normal countries [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=315.88s)]
*  Nobody [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=319.2s)]
*  Nobody's marched on Washington or Beijing or you know any large [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=320.24s)]
*  Functioning country for that matter in recent years [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=325.88s)]
*  And so the bottom line is that Putin's been trying to run this model for a long time [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=328.4s)]
*  We've talked about where he's got the military [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=334.16s)]
*  But then he's got Wagner guys and he's got the Kadir off and the Chechens and you know [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=336.76s)]
*  He's got all these different armed [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=341.82s)]
*  fiefdoms that [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=344.68s)]
*  You know when there wasn't a full-scale war that kind of worked for him because he could use Wagner for some things and he could [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=346.16s)]
*  Use the military for others and not the right hand didn't always know what the left-hand knew was doing but Putin always knew everything [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=351.6s)]
*  Well now like that model has kind of failed in Ukraine [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=357.96s)]
*  you know the Wagner guys were on the front lines and and they were resenting the MOD the MOD guys probably didn't like the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=361.68s)]
*  fact that [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=367.68s)]
*  You know, there's pergosian taking shots at them all the time on telegram [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=368.92s)]
*  you had these kind of far-right bloggers that kind of started to go in the pergosian camp and [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=372.0s)]
*  It was just kind of some chaos and so they're trying to get their arms around this they're trying to absorb Wagner [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=377.84s)]
*  I think the core question here is [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=381.88s)]
*  Very quickly number one. What's the future of pergosian? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=384.92s)]
*  He's apparently gonna get a military base in Belarus [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=388.24s)]
*  That seems odd that he'd just be hanging out there like sure across the border. Let's see if that happens [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=390.68s)]
*  Number two do the Wagner guys actually integrate into the Russian military? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=395.92s)]
*  It seems like the better fighters in Wagner not the kind of cannon fodder convict guys don't really want to do that [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=399.84s)]
*  They have a chip on their shoulder too [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=405.6s)]
*  So do they lose that fighting force? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=407.6s)]
*  Do they lose some manpower any manpower is gonna be a blow to them if it's taking off the battlefield and then to what? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=409.6s)]
*  Extent is Putin's prestige been cut down and not shared not just inside of Russia, but globally [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=415.56s)]
*  What does this mean for other people in that system oligarchs generals corrupt guys who might have their own? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=420.20000000000005s)]
*  You know daydream plan in their head for a military rebellion down the road [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=426.36s)]
*  Bottom line is I think there's some chaos here that Putin's trying to paper over and this doesn't look great for him [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=430.46s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I think was David remenek had a great piece in the Yorker about [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=436.86s)]
*  When Putin first came into politics, he seemed like a normal guy. He kind of spoke like a gangster [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=440.9s)]
*  He sounded like someone who like came off the streets and that made him relatable which is a sharp contrast with these like [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=446.86s)]
*  Decrepit like literally rotting away Soviet leaders now. It seems like pergosians more the man of the people [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=453.06s)]
*  He is literally on the front lines recording these videos. He's talking more honestly about the war [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=459.26s)]
*  He's recruiting in prisons, even though in he was once a convict. He's getting treated like a celebrity, right? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=465.26s)]
*  Everyone knows who he is. They're cheering for him [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=471.18s)]
*  And as you said, he's also tight with this new generation of military bloggers who are key sources of information about the war for many Russians [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=473.18s)]
*  Meanwhile Putin sitting in these same conference rooms with the same handful of advisors [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=481.1s)]
*  He rarely leaves his propagandists on like RT the state propaganda networks [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=486.42s)]
*  We're all cheering for pergosian like five days ago now [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=491.94s)]
*  They have to turn on him [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=496.5s)]
*  But they also have to explain why he seems to be getting this kind of sweetheart deal and barely being punished [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=497.54s)]
*  Like I don't know like to your point [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=502.62s)]
*  That's a very delicate dance that Putin is doing here and I'm not sure it's really achievable [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=505.1s)]
*  Yeah [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=510.78000000000003s)]
*  It's a good point from the remnik piece and if people want to check out some of the background on Putin's rise to power [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=511.3s)]
*  We have a good episode in another Russia [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=515.74s)]
*  The podcast I did was John and I'm sova. That's kind of about the origin story of Putin [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=518.62s)]
*  And the thing there is to your point Putin was criticizing the conduct of the war in Chechnya [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=523.9s)]
*  you know the the Russians have been bogged down and this province breakaway province of Chechnya and [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=531.62s)]
*  Putin was criticizing politicians and he said he was gonna go kill all the Chechens on [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=536.5s)]
*  Literally like he was gonna kill them on the shitter like that [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=540.98s)]
*  That's actually something he said and so he sounded like pergosian in these [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=543.74s)]
*  Telegram videos and there is something kind of eerie where now Putin's the establishment. He's got the war that's not going well [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=548.0600000000001s)]
*  And now you've got guys like pergosian taking shots [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=553.86s)]
*  including shots about the fact that the whole war doesn't make any sense not just the conduct of the war and [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=557.0600000000001s)]
*  Here's the thing none of us know exactly what it's like to live in a totalitarian society like Russia where there's such [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=562.38s)]
*  information control by the state [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=568.94s)]
*  I have to think when the narratives change like [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=570.74s)]
*  continually [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=574.5s)]
*  That adds up. There's only so much weight you can put on just you know one day this guy it's like [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=576.06s)]
*  1984 right we're at war with one country one day and then the next day they pretend like they never happened [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=582.98s)]
*  I mean pergosian is a hero one day then he's a mutineer, you know [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=588.02s)]
*  Like that, you know [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=592.14s)]
*  This was he was gonna be detained and he was gonna be thrown in prison one day [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=593.46s)]
*  And then the next day he's like in Minsk and hanging out there like there are all these shifts in their own narrative that they're [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=597.62s)]
*  telling themselves [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=603.7s)]
*  And meanwhile people are just dying by the thousands in Ukraine. It's only 16 months into the war feels like forever [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=605.26s)]
*  Because like we're just not accustomed to wars of this scale, but how long can he sustain? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=613.5400000000001s)]
*  Not just these casualties, but this dysfunction in his own system and these kind of changing stories that he tells his own people [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=618.6600000000001s)]
*  I really do think this guy just is he's lost his fastball, you know, he doesn't look strong [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=624.9s)]
*  He doesn't look like he's not this story is telling isn't entirely believable. There's clearly more to it [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=630.42s)]
*  If he lets pergosian live [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=637.66s)]
*  Well, then he looks kind of weak because he you know [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=640.82s)]
*  Usually kills people like that or they have accidents and they fall off balconies, but if he kills pergosian [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=643.42s)]
*  I don't know that like he's killing the guy who was commanding the forces that took bakhmut [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=647.78s)]
*  There's not like a winning play for him here. Yes, he seems popular been speaking of narratives [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=653.1s)]
*  There was a readout I saw of the Lukashenko pergosian call [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=658.58s)]
*  That was according to the director of the National Library of Belarus [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=662.1400000000001s)]
*  Here's the quote they immediately blurted out such vulgar things that would make any mother cry [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=665.6600000000001s)]
*  The conversation was hard and as I was told masculine [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=670.34s)]
*  Like a little dose of toxic masculinity when [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=677.5s)]
*  Pergosian and Lukashenko I guess those are phone calls not zooms to that even funnier if they're like, you know [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=681.14s)]
*  Yeah, I mean your video calling each other because pergosian looks like a vampire from a black and white movie and Lukashenko looks like a [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=686.06s)]
*  B-list oligarch. Oh, yeah, you know terrible mustache and all we also learned that US intelligence [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=691.26s)]
*  Apparently knew it advanced at pergosian was plotting this uprising [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=696.78s)]
*  They very quickly leaked that out so they weren't accused of an intelligence failure [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=700.62s)]
*  But it does sound like the US has had the Wagner group kind of wired for a very long time [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=705.06s)]
*  We know that thanks to the discord leaks [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=710.26s)]
*  But it was interesting to see that out there and then President Biden at the same time being like look we had nothing to do [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=711.7399999999999s)]
*  With this this was an internal problem within the Russian system [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=716.8199999999999s)]
*  However, you're reading these stories about US intelligence knowing about it [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=720.14s)]
*  Yeah, and I mean look some of that is like the Wagner guys including pergosian were saying this [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=723.42s)]
*  I'm kind of threatening this but clearly they they must have seen more advanced planning like it seemed like the Wagner guys were like [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=730.0600000000001s)]
*  Hoarding more advanced weapons and preparing to do moving stuff around moving stuff around [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=736.5s)]
*  but I [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=742.4200000000001s)]
*  Don't know there wasn't much utility in narrating this thing because I don't think anybody including pergosian knew where was going an important question that I [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=743.7800000000001s)]
*  The US intelligence community I'm sure is thinking about is it they've said now that they're gonna try to absorb Wagner guys into the Russian [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=751.7s)]
*  Military in this fight in Ukraine [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=758.04s)]
*  What about all these Wagner guys that are hanging out in Syria big question and the Central African Republic and Mali? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=760.0s)]
*  you know, they're all they have a pretty big footprint globally and [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=766.12s)]
*  I'm genuinely curious whether those people even can't like what do they get absorbed to do they get absorbed into the Russian military the [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=770.12s)]
*  FSB then what does that mean for them? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=778.8s)]
*  I think Putin liked to the cutout right of having you know, it's one thing to have a mercenary force in Central African Republic [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=781.36s)]
*  You know running mines and the security for the president of that country [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=787.2s)]
*  What happens if you're saying well now these guys are in the Russian military [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=790.96s)]
*  It doesn't mean the Russian military is occupying the Central African Republic [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=793.92s)]
*  So there's a lot of open questions here about the future of Wagner and this infrastructure that Putin's built [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=796.6s)]
*  But who's running the election interference in 2024? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=801.64s)]
*  You know, like they've you know, Wagner usually ran the the troll farms and the distribution campaigns [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=804.32s)]
*  Or is someone else gonna be in charge of like attacking Joe Biden helping Donald Trump in the next time around? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=809.2s)]
*  So we'll see he's gonna need zip recruiter before we go [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=813.96s)]
*  I do think it's important to point out how Fox News is covering all of this [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=817.0400000000001s)]
*  Here's a quick clip the White House wanted to give the media something else to cover and this is the MO [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=820.2s)]
*  This is exactly the way they do things. In fact on Friday. I said wow, what a blockbuster. What's that message? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=825.84s)]
*  I'm sure there will be an enormous story over the weekend that the White House is going to be pushing to take this story off [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=831.76s)]
*  Of the front page and sure enough [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=837.4000000000001s)]
*  We've got the State Department drumming up all the drama that took place over the weekend in Russia [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=839.12s)]
*  So I don't know if it's gonna break through the mainstream media has has an excuse again not to cover it [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=844.48s)]
*  They're covering everything about Russia and the Wagner group. Yeah, it's true as if it really matters to the US right now [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=849.84s)]
*  Yeah, that was Maria Bartiromo just living in her little conspiratorial world where we just pulled the the Wagner group mutiny [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=854.92s)]
*  Lever and that's how you distract from I assume like a hunter Biden thing. I don't even know what you're talking about [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=862.92s)]
*  That's what the like there's so many things are crazy about that including the fact that that could just be living in some Russian [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=867.44s)]
*  created conspiracy theory [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=872.7s)]
*  But it's also like I think it's hunter Biden's the taxes or something and to be so insane to as to believe that [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=873.6800000000001s)]
*  Whatever weird thing that they're obsessed about with like hunter Biden and his like plea deal or his laptop from several years ago [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=882.5200000000001s)]
*  that somehow that story is more important than [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=889.44s)]
*  Like 25,000 dudes like shooting down Russian military helicopters and taking over cities in Russia and marching on the Kremlin like that [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=892.78s)]
*  That's a strange world that they're living in that's a broken brain [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=900.4599999999999s)]
*  Not you know, there's the five the five milligram edibles the ten sometimes you can push it up to 20 like I don't know [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=903.78s)]
*  What she's taking? Yeah, she's taking the RFK jr. Brand edible [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=910.62s)]
*  Wacked out brain leaking 5g Wi-Fi [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=915.5s)]
*  She's doing those heavy MDMA doses, you know, I don't know what the fuck is going on there [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=918.6s)]
*  Yeah, be careful with those. You don't want to take too many before we move on [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=922.36s)]
*  We should quickly talk about the Ukrainian counter-offensive because it does seem clear now that this brief insurrection [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=925.48s)]
*  Did not change anything in terms of military situation [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=930.28s)]
*  Most of the Wagner forces were already off the battlefield before they like half-heartedly stormed Moscow [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=932.92s)]
*  But you know most analysts agree I think Ben by now that it's like we're like two weeks in the the counter-offensive [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=938.5600000000001s)]
*  Has been incredibly challenging. I think it's going a little slower and a little worse [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=944.2s)]
*  And the Ukrainians had hoped [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=947.8s)]
*  Remember that Ukraine is basically trying to push down from the Zaporizhzhia region to the sea of Azov which would cut off [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=950.12s)]
*  supply lines from Russia to Crimea [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=957.4399999999999s)]
*  But the Russians have had a lot of time to prepare to lay down mines to fortify their defensive positions and they have air [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=960.0s)]
*  Superiority which makes attacking very very hard for Ukraine. So difficult fighting [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=965.96s)]
*  They've also lost a decent chuck hardware apparently like something like 10% of the Bradley fighting vehicles that we the US gave them [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=970.16s)]
*  Those are those like little mini tank things that carry around infantry troops. So long story short [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=977.4000000000001s)]
*  Things are going a little worse than Ukraine would like but again the counter-offensive is just getting started [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=982.96s)]
*  Mike Hoffman who's a very smart military analyst who's quoted everywhere on this stuff pointed out that during last year's [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=988.24s)]
*  Ukrainian offensive when they made massive breakthroughs and took back like insane amounts of territory [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=994.88s)]
*  They were also behind schedule at this stage like roughly two weeks into it [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1000.6s)]
*  So just way way too soon to declare it [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1005.28s)]
*  It's over even if you're the former interim Zenefits CEO and really know your stuff [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1007.28s)]
*  You mean like the generals running Twitter these days [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1013.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah the PayPal generals [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1017.76s)]
*  Kind of like as qualified as being a hot dog vendor in st. Petersburg though, I guess [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1021.1999999999999s)]
*  Without the 30 years of subsequent mercenary and disinformation operations [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1026.8s)]
*  But if you look at the it's a good point and you know [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1032.36s)]
*  We should bear in mind that the real breakthroughs last time happened for them around the like September, you know [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1036.12s)]
*  So we'll see if they can wear down the Russians. I think what is you know [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1042.6799999999998s)]
*  Undeniably the case is that the Russians have kind of defensively fortified their positions. And so the question is [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1047.8799999999999s)]
*  What's going to prevail? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1054.9199999999998s)]
*  Is it going to be the advanced weaponry that has been provided to the Ukrainians and their capacity to kind of figure out a strategy [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1056.32s)]
*  for retaking territory or is it gonna be the kind of defensive posture that the Russians have now taken because they've you know [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1063.56s)]
*  They don't say but they must have given up on trying to take Keefe and are just focused on holding what they've got [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1070.32s)]
*  And I think we'll see I think this is something where people should not be drawing major conclusions until the fall. Yeah agreed [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1075.48s)]
*  Okay, let's switch to President Trump because we've talked a lot on the show about how he stole classified information [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1082.2s)]
*  Brought it to Mar-a-Lago and then lied and obstructed justice when the Department of Justice tried to get the documents back [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1088.24s)]
*  It seemed clear been from the indictment that Trump might be in some big trouble [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1094.04s)]
*  But then last night CNN published some audio that made me reconsider my opinion on this whole thing [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1099.38s)]
*  Let's listen and he said he wanted to attack Iran and [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1106.58s)]
*  It is. This was done by the military given to me. I think we can probably get it [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1111.96s)]
*  I don't know, we'll have to see. Yeah, we'll have to try to figure out a... [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1119.68s)]
*  Declassify. See as President I could have declassified but now I can't you know, but this is classifying [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1124.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, now we have a problem. Isn't that interesting? Yeah. It's so cool. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1129.3600000000001s)]
*  So look we heard Ivan and you probably almost didn't believe me, but now you believe me. No, I believe you. It's incredible, right? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1132.64s)]
*  No, it's not. Hey, bring some bring some cokes in please. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1140.68s)]
*  That's my favorite part of the video is he's like, bring some cokes in please. I like I like when he's like, this is so cool [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1143.3200000000002s)]
*  You know, so cool seven-year-old showing his like Legos to his friend, you know, who is this idiot like goading him on? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1149.2s)]
*  I don't know. It's either like a complete fucking moron or it's like some some genius at drawing him out into crimes [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1155.14s)]
*  Getting him to say like I could have declassified it, but I didn't so it's secret. I shouldn't be doing this [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1162.48s)]
*  I'm guilty. We're no lawyers, but like he is screwed. I mean like this is secret. I can't declassify it [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1167.4599999999998s)]
*  It's off the record. That's not gonna help you pal [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1173.6599999999999s)]
*  How do you defend that now in just to kind of add a couple other angles to this? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1175.98s)]
*  First of all when he says like as president I could have declassified this [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1179.9399999999998s)]
*  No, he couldn't have like there's he actually has like a poor understanding of this like you can't declassify [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1184.1s)]
*  Future war plans like that that has never happened [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1190.4599999999998s)]
*  I mean technically could he make it an argument that somehow he could do that [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1194.22s)]
*  When he was president like this clearly won't count as an argument now like maybe but like [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1198.9s)]
*  he just doesn't the fact that he was president I say it's for four years and [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1204.58s)]
*  Doesn't understand the difference between like some intelligence document and like an active war plan for a future scenario [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1208.66s)]
*  That that's just another crazy component of this another piece is like his weird obsession with Iran and what I've like [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1215.14s)]
*  There's a pretty good we you played the Brett bear clip like a week ago where Brett bear is kind of like [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1223.5s)]
*  How come you hired all these people who think you're a fucking moron? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1228.66s)]
*  like the question I have for Donald Trump to to add to this is like [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1232.1s)]
*  How come you hired all these people that desperately want to go to war with Iran and then are like shocked that that might have [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1235.42s)]
*  Almost happened because literally at the end of his administration. He had lunatics over at the Defense Department [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1242.3s)]
*  He had Mike Pompeo like a guy has been you know trying to start a war with Iran for a while [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1248.3s)]
*  He had people all over his administration who had you know taken the bait of like leaving the Iran nuclear deal making a war more [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1254.18s)]
*  Likely like everything Donald Trump did his president kept bringing us to the precipice of a war with Iran [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1261.5s)]
*  And then he's like shocked at the military even has like a plan for that war like like it [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1267.22s)]
*  There's such like internal like a logic in how he approached that whole issue [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1272.06s)]
*  And to think that he was like somehow you know [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1277.22s)]
*  Outing the military by revealing they had a war punt the military like spoiler alert has war plans for like everything like that's what they do [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1281.5s)]
*  They turn out contingency plans for all kinds of shit in the Pentagon. Like what does he think they do over there? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1288.86s)]
*  Yeah, it's just nonsense. Although he someone just sent me he was asked about it [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1293.7s)]
*  He went out [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1297.7s)]
*  I think Fox News digital asked about it and this reporter is like you're not concerned about these audio tapes with your own voice on them [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1298.04s)]
*  He's like my voice sounded fine. What's the problem? What did I say? We had lots of papers stacked up you can hear them rustling [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1303.84s)]
*  I'm a legitimate like it's just he is just flailing. It is complete nonsense. He knows he is screwed [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1309.6799999999998s)]
*  It's crazy and like again just to hit the sensitivity this everything in that plan would be like incredibly sensitive [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1314.24s)]
*  Like what do we know about where the Iranian nuclear program is? [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1321.4399999999998s)]
*  What kind of weapons and and and and hardware would we use as a part of an attack plan? [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1324.9599999999998s)]
*  What kind of countries would we ask for permissions? I mean like this is the most sensitive shit imaginable in the US government [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1330.1200000000001s)]
*  He's just like I shouldn't be showing this but here I am. He's [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1336.54s)]

*  They're gonna delay and try to get it thrown out and he's just screwed. I don't know. Look, we'll find out [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1347.92s)]

*  The Biden team wants their support on a bunch of issues [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1664.9s)]
*  The war in Ukraine competition with China, etc, etc [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1668.06s)]
*  But a lot of people as we talked about Ben were pissed that Modi was getting the royal treatment [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1670.8600000000001s)]
*  When he fans the flames of Hindu nationalism and doesn't seem to be a big fan of freedom of religion or freedom of speech [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1676.26s)]
*  When it comes from his critics [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1683.26s)]
*  Luckily for us the White House press corps got to ask Modi a few questions about his record [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1686.06s)]
*  Here's what Sabrina Siddiqui from the Wall Street Journal asked Modi [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1691.58s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister India's long pride in itself as the world's largest democracy [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1695.54s)]
*  But there are many human rights groups who say that your government has discriminated against religious minorities and sought to silence its critics [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1700.44s)]
*  As you stand here in the East Room of the White House where so many world leaders have made commitments to protecting democracy [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1708.98s)]
*  What steps are you and your government willing to take to improve the rights of Muslims and other minorities in your country and to uphold free speech? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1716.42s)]
*  so Modi's answer Ben was just like deny everything and to say pablum like [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1724.94s)]
*  Democracy is in our DNA democracy is our spirit democracy runs in our veins, but what happens next? [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1729.26s)]
*  I think really shows his true colors [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1734.58s)]
*  There has been a relentless campaign of harassment [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1736.94s)]
*  Against Sabrina ever since she asked this question both online and in pro Modi news outlets [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1740.3799999999999s)]
*  Even official BJP his party's spokespeople have jumped in on the act and attacked her they've attacked her for having a Pakistani mother [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1745.8999999999999s)]
*  They called her a bigot [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1752.98s)]
*  They tried to claim she's not a regular or real White House reporter and that was actually a secret plant [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1754.3s)]
*  By the White House to embarrass Modi so just for the record that is obviously nonsense like Sabrina's great reporter [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1759.54s)]
*  She literally accompanied Biden to Ukraine like four months ago was the pool reporter on that major trip [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1766.38s)]
*  So she's hardly a new face in the briefing room, but the irony of these idiots [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1771.58s)]
*  Doing this in response to a question about [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1776.78s)]
*  Modi's government going after religious freedom or free speech that still makes your head spin [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1780.1000000000001s)]
*  Modi's allies also went after President Obama for talking about the need to respect the rights of Muslims in India [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1785.26s)]
*  So Ben the White House condemned this harassment, but like do you think that his people? [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1791.4199999999998s)]
*  Understand how much worse they make things when they do shit like this does it even like? [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1796.74s)]
*  Compute it's an interesting thing to watch because I absolutely watched the Sabrina piece of this and also the Obama piece because Obama said [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1802.1s)]
*  That they need to treat the Muslim minority better [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1808.8999999999999s)]
*  And you also kind of try to make an argument like from India's perspective [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1811.06s)]
*  Like a big diverse country like this it risks instability it risks, you know, you know [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1815.26s)]
*  Yeah, real problems if you're persecuting a massive minority of like a couple hundred million people [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1819.94s)]
*  Which is one of the largest populations of Muslims in any country in the world in India [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1825.5s)]
*  and to me [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1830.1s)]
*  It makes him look utterly ridiculous because all he has to say is [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1833.1s)]
*  Is [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1838.18s)]
*  You know, even if because first of all like it's true [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1839.42s)]
*  They treat like the Muslim minority has been singled out. It has bit you've got look [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1842.3400000000001s)]
*  We talked on the show like his chief political opponent who's not Muslim or who Gandhi like they're trying to convict the guy [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1847.9s)]
*  They've got journalists in prison the BJP his party in the RSS movement that like sustains it as its infrastructure [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1853.8600000000001s)]
*  Literally goes after Muslims in the streets. They have trumped up charges against all manner of journalists Rana [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1860.14s)]
*  Who's been on this podcast like can't put her head up without some new tax issue being used against her like this is happening [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1866.06s)]
*  Journalists are being persecuted the Muslim minority in that country is dealing with a lot of crap [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1872.78s)]
*  And and this is you know, Modi's clearly on the top of the superstructure that is doing that [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1877.8999999999999s)]
*  That doesn't mean that Modi is all bad and like Modi like people will point out like he's made some good reforms in the economy [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1882.26s)]
*  He's an important partner on China. Sure. That's all true. But when you react like this like [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1889.52s)]
*  All you have to say is we have more work to do, you know, all we have to say is we're not perfect [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1895.06s)]
*  Nobody is we have to give an inch [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1899.62s)]
*  They won't give an inch and and the fact that they use this kind of dripping Lee [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1901.62s)]
*  Defensive and thin-skinned tone to say we are going to come educate you about how perfect everything is in India or shut up [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1907.7s)]
*  Because you know you only ask this question because you're Pakistani [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1915.5s)]
*  Confirming the bias that you use against people based on their identity in India [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1918.62s)]
*  Like all you're doing is showing the world that you are exactly what? [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1922.58s)]
*  Sabrina was indicating in that question or you are exactly dealing with the kind of problems that Obama talked about in his answer [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1926.74s)]
*  And so to me if you want to be if part of the kind of aspiration of Modi and the BJP is to be a world [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1932.54s)]
*  class power right to be [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1940.54s)]
*  You know taken seriously as you should [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1942.82s)]
*  Because you are like running this country over a billion people you need thicker skin than this [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1946.18s)]
*  So this is ridiculous that you're this thin skinned about everything. I mean it gets worse by the way [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1951.18s)]
*  There was a top BJP official this the chief minister of a basically a state [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1956.98s)]
*  Tweeted that there were many who say Obama in India itself who needed to be taken care of so again doubling down on [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1962.18s)]
*  Bigotry and essentially threatening to kill Muslims or kill the president United States former like these people are so accustomed to just [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1969.38s)]
*  Everybody like we're also you know [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1975.22s)]
*  And this is the problem with like rolling out the red carpet without any criticism at all [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1976.78s)]
*  Because they think that if they just throw these brushback pieces that are racist brushback, but we're gonna take care of who's saying Obama [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1982.1000000000001s)]
*  Okay, tough guy like once you go tweet a few more threats at Muslims. You know you're you're such a powerful man [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1988.1000000000001s)]
*  I mean it just makes them look really small you know and and it's it proves the point of all the critics [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=1994.22s)]
*  Speaking of thin-skinned leaders Ben [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2001.18s)]
*  We talked last week about Secretary of State Tony Blinken's trip to China is meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the hope that this would [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2002.9199999999998s)]
*  All lead to more conversations more communication between the US and China and sort of a general thawing of tensions [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2010.3999999999999s)]
*  That all got a little bit more complicated last week when at a fundraiser [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2016.9599999999998s)]
*  President Biden called President Xi a dictator the longer Biden quote was the reason why Xi Jinping got very upset in terms of when [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2020.8799999999999s)]
*  I shot that balloon down with two boxcars full of spy equipment if he didn't know it was there [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2028.46s)]
*  That was the great embarrassment for the dictators when they didn't know what happened [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2033.26s)]
*  The Chinese responded very angrily they called it a blatant political provocation and quote extremely absurd and irresponsible [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2037.26s)]
*  Then besides creating headaches for Tony Blinken here is probably taking a lot of phone calls [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2045.06s)]
*  How big a deal do you think that comment was like isn't she a dictator who who doesn't know that? [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2049.76s)]
*  Well, I guess to me the more [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2056.74s)]
*  peculiar part of the comment was like [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2059.7s)]
*  Him seeming to be reading out like an intelligence assessment. Yeah [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2062.02s)]
*  Like did does he know how does he know that Xi Jinping didn't know was there is that cuz Xi Jinping kind of denied to him [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2066.98s)]
*  that [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2073.22s)]
*  The that he had sent the balloon or is that because he was kind of revealing something like the whole [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2074.18s)]
*  It just felt like he was sharing a little more information than was necessary at a fundraiser [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2078.82s)]
*  That could have been the part that pissed off she more than the dictator line [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2083.86s)]
*  Yeah, and if it's a calculated effort to get under a skin, that's one thing [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2087.1400000000003s)]
*  I just I can't imagine that like doing that at a fundraiser was like an intentional information operation [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2091.1s)]
*  You know, yeah, it is interesting that over that we talked about this at once or twice before that [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2098.26s)]
*  Biden has personalized like criticism of Xi Jinping a [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2103.7400000000002s)]
*  Fair amount, you know, I'd rather be me than Xi Jinping or she he's a dictator [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2107.86s)]
*  It's kind of funny because in the last campaign [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2112.08s)]
*  We heard a lot from Biden had spent more time with Xi Jinping than any like person on earth and you know [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2114.6s)]
*  There's such great buddies. Yeah, but the the the bromance is definitely faded here [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2120.48s)]
*  but at the end of the day I [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2126.16s)]
*  You know [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2129.8s)]
*  he's the [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2131.2400000000002s)]
*  whenever [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2132.68s)]
*  Whenever these things come up I always have to remind myself that the Chinese government says worst things about Joe Biden all the time [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2134.7200000000003s)]
*  The Indian government, you know is threatening to like kill people with the same name is over the last president [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2142.68s)]
*  So so I think we have to cut our leaders a little slack here [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2147.36s)]
*  like they don't to go all Trump and say absolutely like crazy shit about people but like, you know, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2151.64s)]
*  it's it's kind of a thin skin point again, like [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2156.28s)]
*  Totally, you know the Chinese wolf warrior debuts, you know [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2159.48s)]
*  Have like imagery of Joe Biden that is no different than like what the Republican Party puts out [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2163.36s)]
*  And so for him to every now and then pop off a cheat [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2169.44s)]
*  I don't know. It's not that big a deal and whether he's technically addicted or not, like, you know [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2172.0s)]
*  I guess they'd argue he's the head of the party. Whatever. He's an autocrat. Like that's it is what it is [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2176.4s)]
*  Yeah, I mean like I'm with you listen [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2180.68s)]
*  The Chinese can decide [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2184.72s)]
*  Whether to get offended or not [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2186.8799999999997s)]
*  Remember when Trump took a call from the president of Taiwan right after he was elected breaking with 40 years of diplomatic [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2188.52s)]
*  Tradition before he talked to Xi Jinping like they got over that they had a relationship [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2194.3999999999996s)]
*  We'll see I mean secretary Yellen is supposed to go to China in July [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2197.7999999999997s)]
*  Hopefully that happens and they don't cancel another trip and sort of to protest this but you're right [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2200.96s)]
*  I mean, you know Biden who got asked about this at the press conference by Sabrina actually and his response is basically like I said [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2207.08s)]
*  What I said, and so it seems like you know, he's not gonna walk it back. He doesn't give a shit [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2212.92s)]
*  You know, yeah [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2216.18s)]
*  And it that's I think that's smart and your point about choosing is totally right because they control the media too [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2216.68s)]
*  They can choose to like have their people know that that happened or not, right? [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2222.42s)]
*  Exactly, which kind of proves part of Biden's points, you know [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2225.44s)]
*  Like, you know, it may not be a total dictator like kind of one man one rule [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2228.78s)]
*  Like but you know, there's aspects of that and so what like so deal with it [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2232.82s)]
*  If you if you want to have that kind of control the system [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2237.32s)]
*  You're gonna get criticized by the president United States from the other time. Absolutely [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2239.2200000000003s)]
*  Really awful story out of the Mediterranean then we're a fishing trawler carrying up to 750 migrants and refugees from Pakistan [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2243.62s)]
*  Syria Egypt in the Palestinian territories [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2251.42s)]
*  Capsized off the coast of Greece on June 14th only about a hundred of the people on the boat were rescued alive [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2254.06s)]
*  Literally on a super yacht called the Mayan Queen just like the most dystopian thing possible [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2261.14s)]
*  There are questions about whether the Greek Coast Guard inadvertently caused this boat to capsize [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2266.1800000000003s)]
*  When they attempted to hook a line on it and tow it [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2271.76s)]
*  The boat had been traveling from Libya and they were heading to Italy this bunch of asylum seekers trying to get to the EU [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2274.38s)]
*  The trip was a nightmare before this boat sank people were running out of food and water [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2279.88s)]
*  I think like six people were already dead before it capsized [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2283.7400000000002s)]
*  President Obama was asked about this during a recent event. Here's a clip of what he said [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2287.84s)]
*  There's a potential tragedy unfolding with a submarine that is getting [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2292.84s)]
*  You know minute-to-minute coverage all around the world and it's understandable because obviously we all want and pray that [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2299.76s)]
*  Those folks are rescued [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2307.88s)]
*  But the fact that that's gotten so much more attention than 700 people [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2310.84s)]
*  Who [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2317.6s)]
*  Say [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2320.64s)]
*  That's a [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2328.56s)]
*  That's an untenable situation [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2330.8s)]
*  Important point well taken there [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2333.48s)]
*  Since 2020 there have been a bunch of instances of Greek patrol boats pushing migrant boats back into the water [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2335.48s)]
*  So it's sort of a broader question of the Greek response here Greek public opinion has turned hard against refugees [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2340.26s)]
*  Which undoubtedly then contributed to the success of far-right parties in this past week's elections [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2346.0600000000004s)]
*  The ruling center right party got 40% of the vote but far-right parties won about 13% of the vote [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2352.0s)]
*  Including a new party called the Spartans which is just sort of like a newer version of the Golden Dawn party [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2357.5s)]
*  That was banned in 2020 for being neo-nazis [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2363.98s)]
*  Literally, so the Spartans now have 13 seats in Parliament at the height of its popularity [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2367.22s)]
*  Golden Dawn only got 7% of the vote. So that's a scary trajectory [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2371.02s)]
*  So look all in all like a story about [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2374.46s)]
*  This global failure to manage conflicts and manage refugee flows and how that leads to horrible human consequences and political [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2377.7s)]
*  Consequences, I mean first of all, like I always rooted for the Athenians of the Spartans like in my ancient history like war games [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2386.0600000000004s)]
*  but then [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2392.3s)]
*  and Obama it's funny playing that clip cuz I was like a couple times it's such a reminder of the Obama [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2393.78s)]
*  Deliberate speaking style where you're like is the audio going out and it's like oh no, he's just speaking very slowly and considering his words [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2398.98s)]
*  but I was in Greece with him at the time and [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2404.7400000000002s)]
*  You could sense like on the one hand the the public there is very anti immigrant very anti refugee [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2408.42s)]
*  The political party that we've covered a few of these stories recently where they were pushing back boats [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2416.1400000000003s)]
*  You know, there's a trend of them [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2422.5s)]
*  Kind of seeming to not give a shit when these tragedies happen and maybe pursuing policies that are making them more likely and [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2424.5400000000004s)]
*  Feeling no accountability for that because if anything, they're kind of rewarded for it, you know [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2431.26s)]
*  And and it seems like again the people that didn't go with like the large [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2436.1000000000004s)]
*  Fairly resounding win for the center-right government like when even further right at the same time like this is an untenable situation [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2441.58s)]
*  And so you'd like to think that first of all, there's a real investigation of what happened here [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2449.06s)]
*  You can't just let 700 people die and not like get to the bottom of how that happened and whether the Greek Coast Guard [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2453.34s)]
*  Contributed to it or could have done anything differently. I think secondly Europe has a say here and Europe is kind of been at [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2459.38s)]
*  At least just kind of winking at this kind of policy [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2467.94s)]
*  Because they want to keep migrants out too because their publics are tired of it as well [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2471.82s)]
*  Well, it's not sustainable from a humane standpoint [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2475.18s)]
*  It's not sustainable given the fact that there's going to continue to be migrants there needs to be a rethink of this entire approach [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2477.78s)]
*  What is happening to try to reduce the flows of people coming in? What is happening to try to have more orderly processing? [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2485.14s)]
*  It's not that different by the way from what we're dealing with at our border, you know with people from Central America [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2491.9s)]
*  Like can you have like like their version of an asylum process? [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2497.54s)]
*  That like at least reduces and you're never gonna end these types of desperate people trying to get across [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2502.54s)]
*  The water but can you can you can you put some process around it that reduces that risk? [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2508.98s)]
*  Cut down on the smugglers and traffickers that kind of put people on these vessels that are not prepared to hold that many [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2513.42s)]
*  People like at a minimum as with our own border like they have to be doing more to avert tragedy [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2519.1s)]
*  While trying to think ahead about how can you manage migration flows in a more humane way? Yeah speaking of heartless immigration policies [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2524.98s)]
*  There's a new book out by a guy named miles Taylor who is a former Trump Department of Homeland Security staffer [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2532.98s)]
*  Turned sort of like Trump critic. It talks about how anonymous former [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2538.98s)]
*  anonymous the anonymous op-ed writer in the New York Times [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2543.8199999999997s)]
*  It talks about how Stephen Miller who is the Trump advisor best known for family separation and just for being a monster [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2546.78s)]
*  Argued for having a predator drone fire missiles at a ship full of unarmed migrants [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2553.38s)]
*  That was trying to reach the US this reportedly happened during a conversation [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2559.1000000000004s)]
*  And Stephen Miller had with the commandant of the Coast Guard [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2563.1800000000003s)]
*  It's worth pointing out that Stephen Miller denies that this happened the former Coast Guard commandant says he doesn't remember the conversation [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2566.46s)]
*  But it would be far from the only sadistic policy pitch that Stephen Miller had while in government [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2573.2999999999997s)]
*  Remembered that former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said that Stephen Miller proposed cutting off ISIS leader [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2579.46s)]
*  Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's head dipping it in pig's blood and parading it around as a warning to other [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2585.2999999999997s)]
*  Terrorists, so it sounds like a fun meeting fun guy to hang out with great co-worker [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2591.9s)]
*  Yeah, given that Stephen Miller seems like the kind of guy who like when he was a kid like use magnifying glasses to like fry like insects [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2595.3399999999997s)]
*  On the sidewalk if not his siblings [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2602.42s)]
*  Yeah [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2604.42s)]
*  This is utterly believable as an anecdote like because he definitely sat around and fantasized [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2604.9s)]
*  Sharing means and situation room and like you know drone striking [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2610.34s)]
*  Immigrants on the border like this definitely happened [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2614.5s)]
*  And it's a reminder that among many other things Stephen Miller is a psychopath [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2618.1800000000003s)]
*  You know like it and you only have to like one look at his dead eyes to understand that no doubt no doubt [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2622.92s)]
*  Speaking of psychopaths Ben so I've lost count of the number of allegations of fraud and corruption that have been leveled against Israeli Prime Minister [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2629.06s)]
*  Bibi Netanyahu [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2635.74s)]
*  There's three cases being brought against him one of them is at trial as we speak and according to a report in Politico [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2636.88s)]
*  It featured on Monday testimony from a billionaire Hollywood mogul named Arnon Milchan [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2643.98s)]
*  Who said that his gift-giving to the Netanyahu family became so frequent and routine that they developed code words for the gifts [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2649.98s)]
*  Cigars were called leaves champagne was called roses and luxury dress shirts were called dwarves [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2658.02s)]
*  I was following this little code until we got to the shirts [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2664.6200000000003s)]
*  Milchan said he realized that the nearly [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2667.3s)]
*  $200,000 worth of gifts he'd given the Netanyahu family was excessive when the police opened an investigation seems a little late there, buddy [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2670.7000000000003s)]
*  But in exchange Netanyahu did him favors like contacting [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2678.1400000000003s)]
*  Former Secretary of State John Kerry for help with a visa [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2682.36s)]
*  Pushing for tax breaks that would have helped Milchan so then here [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2685.5200000000004s)]
*  I think may be the craziest part of this political story though [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2689.28s)]
*  Prosecutors demanded that BB's wife Sarah Netanyahu [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2692.32s)]
*  Not make eye contact with Milchan because they were worried she could somehow sway the witness [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2695.76s)]
*  What is happening here? This is woman practice witchcraft. How is eye contact via zoom by the way gonna change this guy's testimony? [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2702.32s)]
*  Well, first of all in the theme of crimes today [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2709.32s)]
*  You know BB's like a little smarter than Trump because at least he had code words, right? Yeah [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2714.32s)]
*  But the net effect is the same, you know, like if if Trump's thing is like I am committing a crime [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2720.2799999999997s)]
*  I didn't declassify it. It is secret. I should be showing it to you [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2726.68s)]
*  BB's is like I should be not taking these gifts from you that is corrupt therefore [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2729.88s)]
*  We're gonna have code words for the gifts, you know, like it's actually just as like proving of guilt in just as brazen [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2735.04s)]
*  It's just a little smarter because at least you have the code words [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2741.52s)]
*  Like if Trump had some code words for the classified documents, he'd be in BB's league here, sir [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2743.4s)]
*  If you are the I always wonder about how people get to be billionaires, you know [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2748.42s)]
*  like who seem to be such complete morons because like we've already talked about some of the morons that like [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2753.04s)]
*  Have all the hot takes on on the war in Ukraine and well actually probably end on the Uighurs where [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2758.96s)]
*  That's one of the all-in-pods greatest moments and its greatest hits album [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2764.4399999999996s)]
*  But in this case like how did this guy succeed so fabulously? [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2768.3599999999997s)]
*  And yet he he can't withstand the like steely gaze and like wink [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2773.72s)]
*  Like furrowed brow of serenity. I can tell you [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2780.16s)]
*  Pretty woman bohemian rhapsody [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2784.9199999999996s)]
*  Mr. And Mrs. Smith, so I don't know Hollywood guy. But yeah, like what is she doing to him with these tractor beam eyes? It's crazy [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2787.36s)]
*  What are we talking about [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2795.8s)]
*  God certain and now once brought me a martini or once or at least like she didn't bring it to me [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2798.04s)]
*  but she certainly like facilitated my having a martini while Obama and [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2802.8s)]
*  BB were like fighting about something was there no but chocolate as some nerve agent [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2807.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't know. Maybe maybe I've never been the same ever since or maybe actually, you know [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2811.46s)]
*  Maybe it is maybe if I ever saw her again, she could like make me do things by just looking at me [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2816.52s)]
*  Yeah, you just be you just be binary cigars binder [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2821.64s)]
*  Just your drink and the next thing you know, you're like shipping stuff over there [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2824.7599999999998s)]
*  You're giving a case of camel unfiltered sending him to Israel and you don't know why [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2827.68s)]
*  We should point out like less funny like as this trial is happening [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2831.24s)]
*  There's been an uptick in violence at the West Bank last week [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2834.6s)]
*  There were these you know hundreds of armed Israeli settlers were rampaging through West Bank towns burning stuff beating people up [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2837.32s)]
*  It's endless cycle of violence this time it occurred after two Palestinian terrorists [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2844.7599999999998s)]
*  I think Hamas terrorists killed four Israelis near a West Bank settlement. The Israeli military has been launching increasingly [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2849.9599999999996s)]
*  Militarized operations in the West Bank in one case. They were firing missiles from Apache helicopters [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2858.3199999999997s)]
*  I think there was a drone strike that might have been the first drone strike since 2006 [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2863.3599999999997s)]
*  I think was the first time a helicopter had been deployed in 20 years [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2867.08s)]
*  So she mentioned this because like this cycle of violence is constant [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2870.2799999999997s)]
*  But meanwhile the the Palestinian Authority [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2874.8399999999997s)]
*  Leadership is gone. They're just [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2878.16s)]
*  Non-existent and the Israeli government is de facto annexing the West Bank more and more every day and it's just like [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2880.56s)]
*  Increasing the likelihood that something very very bad is gonna happen [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2886.3199999999997s)]
*  Especially when the Israeli leadership is is desperate like Netanyahu to stay out of jail and to keep together this right-wing coalition [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2890.08s)]
*  That could maybe you know prevent him from seeing prison time. Yeah, no, that's right [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2896.92s)]
*  I mean like it should be pointing out that they're normalizing this kind of brutality. They have been for a very long time [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2900.68s)]
*  They're normalizing this kind of displacement [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2905.68s)]
*  But the only other element that's worth noting here that is new is that just like Trump Trump [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2907.3199999999997s)]
*  It's existential for him that he get elected president [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2912.92s)]
*  So doesn't go to prison like BB's in the same boat and the more that this case may be closing in on him [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2914.7999999999997s)]
*  The risk of things escalating with the Palestinians or things escalating with him returning to threats to the judicial system [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2919.6s)]
*  Like that that is very likely to happen if he feels like the wheels of justice are catching up to him and and sir [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2926.2599999999998s)]
*  Netanyahu can't make the case go away with her eyes. Yeah [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2932.2799999999997s)]
*  Finally Ben last story here before the interview Miami Mayor Francis Suarez recently jumped into the Republican presidential primary [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2935.66s)]
*  You might be asking who a fair question. He is a huge crypto booster who created the Miami coin [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2942.8199999999997s)]
*  I think I was supposed to replace taxes maybe by minting coins and selling them [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2949.6s)]
*  It is now down something like 96% in value so oops [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2952.66s)]
*  Suarez decided to go on Hugh Hewitt's show to demonstrate his foreign policy chops. Let's hear how it went [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2957.46s)]
*  Will you be talking about the Uyghurs in your campaign? [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2963.7s)]
*  What the what the Uyghurs? [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2967.5s)]
*  What's a we hear? Okay, we'll come back to that. Let me you won't be I've got to get smart on that [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2970.42s)]
*  And then and then they come back to it again later. Here's the second clip you gave me homework [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2975.18s)]
*  You [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2979.7400000000002s)]
*  The Uyghurs you really need to know about the Uyghurs mayor you got to talk about it every day [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2982.7400000000002s)]
*  Okay, I will I will talk about I will I will [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2988.98s)]
*  Weakers, I'm a good learner. I'm a fast learner [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2992.46s)]
*  Suarez today tweeted that of course, he knows what the Uyghurs are [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2995.2200000000003s)]
*  But he just didn't catch the pronunciation for those who don't know the Uyghurs are a mostly Muslim ethnic minority group in Western China [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=2997.82s)]
*  The Chinese government has thrown more than a million of them in reeducation camps where they are often tortured in what has been called [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3003.9s)]
*  a crime against humanity or genocide the US government actually called it genocide [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3011.5800000000004s)]
*  Ben did the mayor get your vote? [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3016.02s)]
*  First of all, why is Hugh Hewitt like the place you go to to like demonstrate your foreign policy chops? [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3020.0600000000004s)]
*  I don't know, you know like like noted intellect here like a complete buffoon Hugh Hewitt [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3024.36s)]
*  Second like I like I love his like comeback was like I didn't catch the pronunciation when he actually repeated the pronunciation [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3029.3s)]
*  Really accurately. What's a Uyghur like he got it right himself in his his comeback [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3036.1400000000003s)]
*  Then let me say a weird thing that Hugh Hewitt did to where he's like [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3041.5800000000004s)]
*  You should be talking about it every day [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3044.98s)]
*  Which was kind of odd too because like like nothing about that exchange like made any sense on any level whatsoever [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3048.1000000000004s)]
*  But it does go to show the reason it matters is the only [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3054.5s)]
*  Claim this guy has for running is that he's mr. Anti-communist, right? Like because he's you know, he's in Miami there [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3057.86s)]
*  He hates the Cuban Communist Party, right? [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3063.86s)]
*  And his whole line has always been like we fight communism here in Florida [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3065.78s)]
*  And so actually like you really should know about the Uyghurs [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3069.58s)]
*  Particularly if your whole campaign is about how terrible communism is because the Uyghurs are the people [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3074.54s)]
*  That are being treated the absolute worst by a communist party in the world. So, you know a little more homework [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3080.54s)]
*  But I'm also like not exactly buying stock in that presidential campaign [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3086.7999999999997s)]
*  Maybe he could go run the Bitcoin city that Bukele is building down in El Salvador. That's a really good [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3090.8799999999997s)]
*  Qualification for that. That's a really good idea. He does have [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3096.8799999999997s)]
*  Experience running a city into the ground with cryptocurrency [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3100.2s)]
*  Yeah, Hugh Hewitt is interesting because like he is like one of the most frustrating [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3102.8799999999997s)]
*  Shameless defenders of everything Trump does just like love it calls them like the intellectual Zamboni's who just kind of mop up after him [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3108.2799999999997s)]
*  But he also cares about foreign policy and ask questions. He loves to ask about the Uyghurs [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3114.52s)]
*  He likes to ask about the nuclear triad and how one would maintain that he likes to ask about [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3119.64s)]
*  Algeris and whether he was a spy for the Soviet Union [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3125.2000000000003s)]
*  So he has these like hobby horses that I'm glad he asked about but are very easy to prepare for and still doesn't make it [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3129.52s)]
*  Okay to just defend everything Trump did because by the way Trump [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3137.2400000000002s)]
*  Famously told Xi Jinping that locking up the Uyghurs was the right thing to do and to keep going [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3141.04s)]
*  We know this because John Bolton told everybody that he did it the classic thing with Hugh Hewitt [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3146.6s)]
*  I'm just gonna say so he was like obsessed with me for a while like towards the end of the Obama administration [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3151.02s)]
*  and he for some reason he used to call me like the [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3154.8799999999997s)]
*  The Metternich of MSNBC or something which doesn't make any sense [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3158.2s)]
*  What a great topical reference [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3161.92s)]
*  Well, it also kind of make me out to be like smarter than he was saying I was like not like Metternich was a dumb guy [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3163.7599999999998s)]
*  And he actually asked me I don't know if I totally tell me to come on and do his show for three hours [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3169.7799999999997s)]
*  administration [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3175.8199999999997s)]
*  Like when my book came out my publicist called and she said I think I've we have great like thing will get great publicity [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3177.22s)]
*  You know, he asked you to do his entire show with him [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3182.22s)]
*  I'm like, you know what? I don't care how many books that would sell like I'd rather do anything [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3184.5s)]
*  It's fucking channel them. But my favorite thing that Hugh Hewitt is for all his like intellect [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3189.2999999999997s)]
*  I remember love it went on that show [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3193.4199999999996s)]
*  At the beginning the Trump administration Mike Flynn was being a poor national security advisor [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3195.9s)]
*  And I just loved it taking some shots at him [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3199.9s)]
*  So Hugh Hewitt had him on because he was gonna like fillet him and one of his gotcha things to love [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3201.58s)]
*  It was like you're friends with Ben Rhodes and he's so much less qualified than Mike Flynn [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3205.84s)]
*  Well, look at look at Mike Flynn, right? Like this is what I mean [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3209.66s)]
*  Like Hugh Hewitt puts him out to be this like serious guy [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3212.14s)]
*  Like he's Hugh Hewitt this great intellect and meanwhile the guy that he was boosting and like, you know [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3214.58s)]

*  Yes, but he's like a half an inch deep. Yeah, I mean look he was the former president CEO of the Richard Nixon Foundation [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3230.02s)]

*  Thank you for joining the show. Thanks for having me Tommy. So we're here to talk about a [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3502.96s)]
*  Topic near and dear to my heart sports washing. I don't even know if we call it that anymore [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3508.52s)]
*  It's just sort of foreign conglomerates buying teams basically [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3512.2400000000002s)]
*  Um, but you guys broke the news that Qatar's sovereign wealth fund is buying a 5% [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3515.32s)]
*  Stake in this parent company that owns the Washington Wizards the Washington Capitals and the Washington Mystics [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3521.44s)]
*  It's a NBA NHL and WNBA franchises [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3527.76s)]
*  I believe this is the first time a sovereign wealth fund has bought into an NBA team and it might be Qatar's first [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3531.04s)]
*  Investment period in US pro sports. What do we know about this deal? [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3536.92s)]
*  Like how it came to be and I'm guessing it's not a coincidence that it's the focus is on Washington DC to start [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3540.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I think the most interesting place to start is [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3548.0s)]
*  Just kind of macro level sports teams in the US are so expensive [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3551.28s)]
*  They're getting so expensive right now a decade ago [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3555.56s)]
*  You could have bought an NBA team for a couple hundred million dollars. The most recent one just sold for four billion [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3558.28s)]
*  What was that the Charlotte Hornets within Michael Jordan's like a do a terrible job. Yeah. Oh, sorry the second most recent [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3563.76s)]
*  Yeah, that was the I'm talking about the Phoenix Suns, right? I'm sorry. You're right. You're right [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3570.2000000000003s)]
*  The hornets also just sold for multiple billion and Jordan 10x is investment despite doing a terrible job. Sorry to interrupt [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3573.28s)]
*  That's that's how that's why these assets are so great [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3579.28s)]
*  Right because you don't have to do a great job and you get it and you get a great exit [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3582.0s)]
*  And owners are realizing that when you have [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3586.0800000000004s)]
*  Multi-billion dollar assets just the pool of people that have the money and the interest in buying those or buying into those [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3588.96s)]
*  Get smaller and smaller [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3595.1200000000003s)]
*  So if you're running out of buyers you have to expand the pool of buyers and in the past [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3596.48s)]
*  Two years every major US League except the NFL has suddenly opened its doors to institutional money [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3601.28s)]
*  And that's private equity funds primarily so far, but it's also endowments and and as we're talking about here [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3607.48s)]
*  It's sovereign wealth funds. So so all of this is [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3614.4s)]
*  essentially dates back or stems back to this idea that we're just running out of rich guys that can buy teams and [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3617.64s)]
*  if you want your valuations to keep appreciating you need more buyers and [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3623.6800000000003s)]
*  Institutional money is is the answer to that right now. Oh my god [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3628.92s)]
*  You just said endowments if the Harvard endowment buys like the Boston Red Sox [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3631.64s)]
*  I will I will be more upset than the Saudis. I'll flip over this table. I'm just telling you [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3635.48s)]
*  I would not be shocked if at some point [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3639.0s)]
*  It's funny we joke about the Harvard one and Boston sports teams as well just because it makes sense [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3641.16s)]
*  But it's proven to be a bulletproof investment [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3646.1s)]
*  It's been 50 years I think since a professional US team sold for less than it was bought for well [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3649.84s)]
*  They really are at least right now. They have proven to be fantastic investments [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3655.4s)]
*  Yeah, so the NBA you mentioned this the NBA changes rules last year to allow for the sort of limited foreign investments [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3660.54s)]
*  They're now going to review the deal. Do you think they'll have any issues? [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3666.0s)]
*  I [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3669.04s)]
*  Cannot imagine a Tehli answers and monumental and the Wizards getting this far in and and not knowing that the NBA was okay with this [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3670.0s)]
*  So I would be shocked if anything happens in the next few weeks to [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3678.76s)]
*  To squash the steel. I think that again when you get to the point of putting ink on paper [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3682.44s)]
*  I think they have a pretty good idea that the NHL and the NBA are both gonna be gonna be fine with this [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3687.52s)]
*  And look, there's obviously, you know, there's some controversy here where I'm sure we're gonna get into it [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3693.8s)]
*  but the NBA is no stranger to a lot of that controversy over the past few years in terms of its relationships with foreign governments and [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3699.0s)]
*  I'm sure Ted and everyone at the NBA also was very aware [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3706.6s)]
*  How some people were gonna feel about this news as long as the Amir doesn't flash his gun on an Instagram live twice [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3710.32s)]
*  It will be okay. Well, I mean so as you noted the NBA they've been forward-leaning [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3715.94s)]
*  When it comes to speaking out on social justice issues in particularly they let players speak their minds at a time when other franchises weren't [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3720.14s)]
*  Or other leagues [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3727.76s)]
*  I mean in 2017 the NBA pulled the All-Star Game out of Charlotte after North Carolina passed that bathroom bill that required transgender people [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3728.7200000000003s)]
*  To use public restrooms that matched the sex on their birth certificates not who they were that day [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3736.32s)]
*  Has there been any pushback on? [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3742.84s)]
*  Qatar as an investor given its laws criminalizing same-sex relations from any of the leagues [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3745.48s)]
*  I'm sure there is pushback when the NBA you mentioned a year ago [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3751.28s)]
*  They kind of expanded this institutional money thing to include sovereign wealth [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3755.04s)]
*  What I always understood from talking to folks at the league was that it was gonna be a case-by-case basis [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3759.4s)]
*  It didn't mean that anyone any any pool of money [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3764.44s)]
*  anywhere in the world could just buy into an NBA team just because one owner wanted it to happen and [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3767.32s)]
*  And because of that, I honestly I'm kind of surprised that the QIA is the first one to be doing this [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3772.44s)]
*  There are certainly less controversial [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3778.04s)]
*  Sovereign wealth funds out there that you imagine probably are interested in owning an NBA team or a piece of one [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3780.12s)]
*  That might have gone first [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3786.12s)]
*  Cutter I think around the World Cup and I know you guys have done a lot around that there was no [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3788.2s)]
*  No shortage of coverage about some of the human rights concerns that happened in the run-up to that event [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3793.04s)]
*  And Adam Silver the Commissioner of the NBA [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3798.92s)]
*  It's funny what was asked about this exact topic a few weeks ago when the live PGA tour [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3801.6s)]
*  Commercial merger happened right and there are some similarities and some key differences between [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3807.32s)]
*  That huge business story and this one [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3811.84s)]
*  but one of the things that Adam said which I thought was interesting was that [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3814.7200000000003s)]
*  he had faith in the in the media to essentially it when deals like this happened when news like this happens to highlight the [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3818.0400000000004s)]
*  the other parts about maybe some of the [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3825.44s)]
*  The less great things about some of these foreign governments and and where the money is coming from [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3827.8s)]
*  So it's certainly something that the NBA has thought about and I'm sure there's other NBA owners that are looking at this deal and saying [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3832.4s)]
*  Man, I'm glad the Wizards are first and we can announce a deal of ours in a few months or in a few weeks [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3839.56s)]
*  Even whatever it looks like I think the more of these that happen [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3845.68s)]
*  I think the smaller the outcry is gonna be for sure [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3849.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3851.84s)]
*  And look, you know the the World Cup was especially egregious because you had all the human rights considerations in the treatment of LGBT people [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3852.36s)]
*  But then on top of that Qatar had to build all the infrastructure for the cup and they do it essentially with slave labor [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3859.68s)]
*  You know [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3866.0s)]
*  There are some estimates from the Guardian that some of the six thousand some odd people foreign laborers died in the process [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3866.3799999999997s)]
*  Obviously that won't be an issue here if you're just buying a five percent stake in an NHL team [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3872.2s)]
*  Definitely and and this is a we should say it's a passive investment the NBA when it set up these rules was very clear [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3877.96s)]
*  These institutional investors and whether that's private equity or QIA or sovereign wealth funds [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3884.12s)]
*  They're not allowed to have board seats. They're not allowed to have any actual say in the governance of the teams [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3889.04s)]
*  many minority partners [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3894.56s)]
*  And I'm not privy to the actual details of this one [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3896.16s)]
*  But many minority partners also don't have full rights if they wanted to sell the stake later on [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3898.52s)]
*  There's a very good chance that if QIA in five years decided we don't want to be invested in monumental anymore [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3902.84s)]
*  It might it might just go back to [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3908.58s)]
*  Monumentals other other shareholders. So so these are limited in a lot of different ways [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3910.68s)]
*  There are limited investments at least right now [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3914.94s)]
*  I think the obvious question there is if if things keep appreciating in value at some point do we see institutional? [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3916.94s)]
*  Investors buying controlling stakes and teams. It's certainly possible. We're not we're not there right now [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3924.86s)]
*  But again in some ways, I think the writing has been on the wall here for a while and Tommy [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3929.9s)]
*  It's interesting that there's a lot of ways in which sovereign wealth funds are already their fingerprints are all over American sports [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3935.32s)]
*  They're all over the American economy as a whole right? [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3942.12s)]
*  but the the these sovereign wealth funds are investing in the same private equity funds that are buying teams and [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3944.52s)]
*  They're less investing alongside [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3950.04s)]
*  billionaire sports team owners in their other businesses and [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3952.52s)]
*  They're in the US equity markets owning pieces of teams like the Knicks and the Rangers and the Braves which are all publicly traded in various [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3955.2s)]
*  Ways they're investing in sports adjacent companies like fanatics and CAA for example [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3962.8199999999997s)]
*  There's so many other ways in which sovereign wealth funds are already [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3968.88s)]
*  Doing a lot of financial work in in US sports. This is just the closest proximity [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3973.8s)]
*  we've seen between a sovereign wealth fund and a [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3979.0s)]
*  Major team in the NBA or the NHL. Yeah, I think that's a really good point [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3983.4s)]
*  I mean some of the coverage of this purchase by the Qataris [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3987.08s)]
*  Suggested that this is sort of the first of many deals that are brewing [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3991.96s)]
*  From sovereign wealth funds. Do you think this is a situation where? [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3995.92s)]
*  Somebody goes first and then there's sort of a flood of foreign cash into these leagues. I think the floodgates are open [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=3999.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think I think we're gonna see a lot of this and just to put in perspective the QIA is [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4005.56s)]
*  It's almost five hundred billion dollars under management and to compare that to the wealthiest humans in America [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4010.24s)]
*  That's essentially exactly the net worth of Bill Gates Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos combined [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4016.56s)]
*  The three richest people in America so again when you're looking for richer pools of capital [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4022.08s)]
*  It's really on a totally different scale the size of PIF the Saudi Arabian Fund that is that is is doing what it's doing in [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4027.96s)]
*  Golf QIA which is invested here and there's a number of others [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4035.04s)]
*  It's just we're talking about a pool of money that doesn't exist in the hands of any human on the planet [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4038.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, don't even get me started on the Norwegians. They're sitting on [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4043.88s)]
*  The Kings Kings [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4047.28s)]
*  Yeah, well so look yeah [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4050.2000000000003s)]
*  I mean I guess I'm naive it did seem like for a little while people were worried about sports washing or at least you know [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4051.86s)]
*  Sort of offended by it in some instances [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4057.92s)]
*  The PGA was the leader of the charge in terms of criticizing the Saudi sovereign wealth fund and their investment in the live golf [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4059.92s)]
*  Tour that was until they caved and then merged with live after a year of like basically accusing them of doing 9-eleven [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4067.6800000000003s)]
*  Do you think like is the era of companies even pretending to care about human rights records of places like Saudi or Qatar? [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4075.7599999999998s)]
*  Is that over? [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4082.96s)]
*  It's such a good question. And again, just because the sovereign wealth funds are everywhere already [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4084.24s)]
*  I think it's there are people in the NBA and around [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4089.3999999999996s)]
*  US sports that feel like this is honestly no different than than than the other ways that I was describing and I think there's an [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4093.16s)]
*  obvious kind of other side to that point, which is again, this is the most [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4099.44s)]
*  Proximate we've seen a sovereign wealth fund and its logo and a US sports team and its logo, right? [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4104.0s)]
*  so there's definitely a way to look at this investment as [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4111.240000000001s)]
*  Some kind of new ground that is being broken [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4114.52s)]
*  I do think in the NBA obviously had this this huge issue with China a few years ago that [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4116.6s)]
*  Yes, you know better than most people became this political football to mix my sports metaphors [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4122.8s)]
*  That really did affect the league and affect its business overseas [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4128.68s)]
*  I think that sports team owners are probably realizing that yeah [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4132.219999999999s)]
*  There's a there's probably a few years in here where these deals are going to be controversial that when the PGA announces [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4136.74s)]
*  It's combining its its its commercial [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4142.62s)]
*  Assets and taking money exclusively from from Saudi Arabia that there are a lot of people that [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4145.099999999999s)]
*  Freak out about that but that the moral [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4150.46s)]
*  Authority starts to wane a little bit and again, I would not be shocked if there are [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4153.299999999999s)]
*  let's say there's ten of these deals in the next year if [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4157.66s)]
*  If the kind of outcry about it and the fears of sports washing just kind of incrementally disappear as he and I know this is [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4160.740000000001s)]
*  Really cynical just disappear as each and each successive deal gets announced [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4167.46s)]
*  Yeah, I mean look to your point about the the NFL being kind of the only holdout preventing these kinds of deals from happening [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4171.660000000001s)]
*  I mean like who could afford the Dallas Cowboys. What are they worth now like ten billion dollars? [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4176.660000000001s)]
*  It's this is this is probably the topic that at Sportico [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4181.14s)]
*  We talk about the most right now because the the commanders are for sale right now another DC team [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4184.14s)]
*  Some of the richest men in the world are involved in the ownership group [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4189.860000000001s)]
*  That's buying the commanders and they have actually struggled to put together the financing to get that six billion dollar deal done [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4192.860000000001s)]
*  And the NFL as I mentioned, it's the only league that hasn't done this yet [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4199.9800000000005s)]
*  I think that's just because they haven't had to and if the NBA if the NFL was to go through a say if the doubt [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4203.900000000001s)]
*  Cowboys hit the market right now. You're right. Tommy. It's a it's a ten billion dollar asset. Maybe maybe that's a little high [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4209.660000000001s)]
*  The the amount of people that have ten billion in cash to get a deal done [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4215.52s)]
*  There's nobody really and maybe Jeff Bezos would be the only one so I would expect the NFL at some point to change its rules [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4219.68s)]
*  I just think it's gonna take a sale that goes horribly wrong or a process by which there there is no [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4225.8s)]
*  Billionaire waiting in the wings to get that deal done. I don't think the NFL is it's certainly [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4231.96s)]
*  I don't think standing on any kind of moral high ground here. I think it is more [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4236.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's just it's a necessity and and again the minute a [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4240.12s)]
*  NFL owner says you mean my team is gonna stop appreciating in value unless we change the rules to let [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4243.88s)]
*  Private equity funds and sovereign wealth funds buy into teams the minute that happens [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4250.599999999999s)]
*  I think you see those rules get changed pretty quickly [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4254.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, and look the Roger Goodell the the head of the NFL the commissioner he lives to serve the owners [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4256.48s)]
*  And if they can think they can make much more money on the sale of these teams or just inflate the price of their assets [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4262.84s)]
*  I'm sure they'll do it. Also Jerry Jones ain't gonna live forever folks. I mean, you know, these teams are gonna move [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4267.92s)]
*  The NFL it's such an interesting one of the most bulletproof American businesses [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4272.280000000001s)]
*  I think out there but but the NFL teams they trade so infrequently and they sell so [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4276.76s)]
*  infrequently NBA there's a controlling stake sale [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4282.4400000000005s)]
*  It feels like every like four or five months almost the NFL there's been I think in the past decade [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4285.360000000001s)]
*  There's been three teams that have sold and this is an amazing staff [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4290.16s)]
*  But it always blows my mind of the 32 current NFL owners [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4293.46s)]
*  There are more of them that bought their team earlier family members bought their team for [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4298.0s)]
*  $25,000 or less then bought their team for more than a billion dollars. Oh my god. That's just incredible [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4302.92s)]
*  There's just so many ownership groups that go back to the 30s or go back to the 40s [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4308.08s)]
*  When you could buy teams for $100 or $500 or whatever it is and then compare that with the NBA where [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4312.120000000001s)]
*  So many of the of the NBA franchises have traded in the past in the past decade or so [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4319.320000000001s)]
*  It's just a different animal and again the NFL I think by virtue of [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4324.36s)]
*  Having so infrequent a controlling stake sale [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4328.5199999999995s)]
*  They just don't have to confront a lot of these economic realities that other leagues like the NHL or NBA [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4331.719999999999s)]
*  Just have to confront sooner because they're having so many different transactions [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4338.04s)]
*  Yeah [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4341.36s)]
*  And for every like great family or ownership group like the the Rooney family there are NFL owners who look really rich on paper [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4341.88s)]
*  Because they own this thing that's super valuable [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4349.36s)]
*  But they actually don't have any cash to bring in new players so these franchises suck for decades 100 100% [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4351.4s)]
*  Yeah, the Rooney's I'm sure you have experience with the Rooney family as well in Washington. Yeah, they're a great example [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4357.28s)]
*  There's a number again [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4362.639999999999s)]
*  There's a number of teams that have that have that have had the same owners for for 80 years, right? [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4363.799999999999s)]
*  And and you're right. They're not they're not Steve Ballmer buying the Clippers [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4369.0s)]
*  This is just a family that had an asset that suddenly became super valuable [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4372.36s)]
*  And and again, we're not just talking about you know [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4376.5599999999995s)]
*  As we talk about these economic forces, we're not just talking about the control stakes [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4379.58s)]
*  We're also talking about the minority stakes, right and if the Rooney's wanted to take [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4383.02s)]
*  Ten percent of the Steelers off the table and and and get someone to invest five hundred million dollars or whatever that would cost [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4387.54s)]
*  Probably something right around there [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4393.62s)]
*  They might have a hard time selling that right that that would be that would be a hard stake [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4395.62s)]
*  To sell because when you're a minority owner, you just don't you don't have that many rights, right? [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4399.34s)]
*  Tommy if you wanted to buy five percent of the Red Sox, it's just a really expensive season ticket [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4404.02s)]
*  You're not making decisions about about players, even though I'm sure you probably want to you're not you're not voting on board decisions [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4410.34s)]
*  Things like that [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4416.96s)]
*  It's a passive stake and if a lot of people don't want to park that much money into something [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4417.5s)]
*  That even though it may be fun to own you're just not doing that much with yeah [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4422.74s)]
*  That basically you get your tickets and the players have to pretend to be nice to you [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4426.74s)]
*  I bet that's kind of it [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4429.96s)]
*  And look if you're one of these owners who have had a team for a long time [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4430.7s)]
*  And you want to hand it down to your kid the taxes on that the estate tax is probably a pretty big hit and makes [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4433.86s)]
*  It challenging really hard and and and depending on who's in the White House [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4439.14s)]
*  Those estate those estate tax rules change a little bit and we saw with the turnover a few years ago from President Trump to President Biden [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4443.38s)]
*  A lot of sports teams trying to figure out what the implication was there [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4450.14s)]
*  Is there shares that I want to give down to to my kids now and as opposed to in a year that there's there's so much [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4454.38s)]
*  different interesting tax machinations and this is true obviously in every business not just in sports [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4461.1s)]
*  But owners are definitely thinking about that as well. Let's keep those taxes high people at least the estate tax [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4466.1s)]
*  So listen, you know, I worked in DC for a long time. I saw the way [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4471.22s)]
*  Gulf countries would dump money into lobbying. They would dump money into think tanks all kinds of different ways to pedal influence [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4475.620000000001s)]
*  They would throw parties for people [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4483.5s)]
*  When I saw that, you know, the first investment was in [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4485.620000000001s)]
*  Three DC based teams. I thought more soft power more chance for influence peddling [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4489.3s)]
*  Is that fair or do you think this is more like Ted Leonsis the owner of the parent company of these three teams? [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4494.58s)]
*  Maybe as these long relationships. I'm of two minds here [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4499.78s)]
*  I don't think it's a coincidence that the first big sovereign wealth investment in US sports happened in DC [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4502.82s)]
*  I just it just it just can't be there's so many reasons why a country like Qatar [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4508.18s)]
*  In addition to I'm sure wanting to own a piece of these assets [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4512.34s)]
*  Also like the idea of owning a very high-profile investment in the nation's capital. There's so much there that makes sense [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4516.22s)]
*  One thing I will say about monumental Ted has proven [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4522.74s)]
*  Year in year out. He is willing to push the envelope on a lot of these things [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4526.5s)]
*  I would consider him to be one of the more [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4530.14s)]
*  progressive [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4533.22s)]
*  Sports team owners out there from a business standpoint [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4534.3s)]
*  He built I think before a lot of other owners realized this was the future he built this sports empire, right? [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4537.1s)]
*  Where it's not just teams, but he owns capital one arena where the Wizards and the Capitals play [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4543.7s)]
*  He owns NBC Sports Washington the the media network [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4548.5s)]
*  He understood that there is a flywheel here and the way to really build the the future sports ownership group [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4552.06s)]
*  Was to have these teams and then put media put real estate put technology around it [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4558.26s)]
*  And really help them all grow in concert [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4563.74s)]
*  so I do think that Ted I'm not surprised also that Ted would be the first to do this or would be on the cutting edge of [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4566.46s)]
*  Dipping his toe into this into this new opportunity [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4572.54s)]
*  So so there's kind of two things they I'm curious for you Tommy that I imagine [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4575.0199999999995s)]
*  Did you go to sporting events a lot when you were working in Washington? [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4578.98s)]
*  the the the thing that I'm always curious about is I just hear a lot about [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4581.62s)]
*  Senators and congressmen and congresswomen and Supreme Court justices that go to nationals games or go to Capitals games [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4585.7s)]
*  And I imagine there's a part of this that is also enticing to QIA also in that you just get some of these exact people [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4592.0199999999995s)]
*  In these power roles coming actually through the building that you're investing in as well [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4598.22s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't go to a lot of games because I don't know I just [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4602.22s)]
*  Stuck at work probably but like there was a there was a huge scandal where there was a basically a lobbyist named Jack [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4607.18s)]
*  Abraham off who was buying off members of Congress and senators etc by essentially having boxes at Redskins games and was doing a lot of [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4612.22s)]
*  business [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4619.9800000000005s)]
*  Through sports so I do think like there will [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4621.3s)]
*  Undoubtedly be sort of a big element of soft power in terms of inviting people who are in these positions their ethics rules that sort of [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4624.06s)]
*  Govern the price of a ticket you can accept for free [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4629.8s)]
*  But that doesn't matter if you're not in government proper or not elected official necessarily [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4632.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, there's so many there's so many different reasons why people invest in teams [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4638.12s)]
*  The Ted Turner bought the brave so long ago because he needed content for his media empire [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4642.4400000000005s)]
*  right and Bruce Ratner was involved in buying the nets because [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4647.6s)]
*  There was a real estate development opportunity next door that he wanted to be a part of so I think almost every sports investment in [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4650.6s)]
*  Some capacity is this is a good asset and I'm gonna have fun owning this and then also [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4657.64s)]
*  This does X or Y for the other parts of my business that is also really invaluable [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4662.56s)]
*  So I think there's always kind of multiple parts of an investment certainly one of the scale [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4667.84s)]
*  So final question for you if this were the the world's worst video game the final boss here of sports [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4672.92s)]
*  Washington in my mind would be the Saudis getting the 2030 World Cup [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4678.68s)]
*  They're bidding they've kind of bought off Lionel Messi [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4683.4400000000005s)]
*  You know the greatest soccer player of all time to be one of their spokespeople even though his home country is a competing bid [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4686.42s)]
*  Where do you think we stand on that? I mean like FIFA is the most viable and it sports entity out there. So I [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4693.16s)]
*  There is no length at which I would expect for for for international sport and the Olympics and and FIFA [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4701.76s)]
*  I kind of group together in this way [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4708.3s)]
*  Nothing would surprise me in that regard the the and and and this this could very well be the the end goal here, right? [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4710.3s)]
*  The pif is gonna control professional golf or partially control professional golf moving forward if this PGA [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4717.02s)]
*  Merger gets done. It's not the only asset that I know PIF is sniffing around in terms of US sports [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4724.34s)]
*  They're already doing a lot in fight sports. For example [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4730.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there's a good chance that that all of this is a coordinated effort to try to make something like the Olympics [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4733.860000000001s)]
*  Takeoff and in the cutter World Cup, I think for as much as I think here in the US media wise [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4740.34s)]
*  I think maybe people would be surprised [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4746.46s)]
*  I think if you are if the goal was to get more Middle Easterners to want to go to cutter or more Europeans to want [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4748.22s)]
*  To go to cutter. I think I think it was a massive success for [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4754.42s)]
*  For the country for the government for the host committee all that so yeah [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4758.06s)]
*  I think these big tentpole sporting events just like the big tentpole sports teams [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4762.28s)]
*  If you can if you can invest in them if you can host them [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4766.860000000001s)]
*  Again, there's so many ancillary business benefits to doing that and nothing would surprise me with the 2030 [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4770.42s)]
*  Olympics and and subsequent World Cups as well. Yeah, I agree with you [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4777.34s)]
*  I think there's a lot of great coverage in the lead-up to the World Cup about their human rights record and about the treatment of [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4781.3s)]
*  Workers, but ultimately when the game started that's people focused on and everyone always kind of knew that [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4786.3s)]
*  Evan thank you so much for doing the show. Where can folks follow you and find your work? [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lno11VHeQ3k&t=4792.26s)]
