Video Description: Tommy Vietor and Ben Rhodes discuss the dire humanitarian situation on the ground in Gaza and the disconnect between the Biden administration’s words and deeds when it comes to protecting civilians in Gaza, including the veto of a UN Security resolution calling for a ceasefire and additional weapons sales to Israel. They also discuss Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s visit to Washington and plea for more security assistance, and republican efforts to tie Ukraine funding to border security, the mess at the UN’s climate summit, a territorial dispute between Venezuela and Guyana, a masked mystery candidate running for president in Ghana and Elijah Wood’s Russian propaganda blunder on Cameo. Then, Max Fisher joins the show to discuss trends in global elections in 2023, and how 2024 may be the biggest election year in history.

# Is U.S. Support for Israel Leading to Isolation From Other World Powers?
**Pod Save the World:** [December 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc)
*  Welcome to pot save the world. I'm tommy vitor and ben rhodes welcome home. Thank you. How's the jet lag? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=0.0s)]
*  Uh, it's a little rough. I've been waking up at like 4 30, you know, that's tough [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  I thought it might be rough. So I wanted to read you a motivational speech to get you pumped up for today's episode [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=9.84s)]
*  I hope that's okay [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=14.88s)]
*  This is from an article in the athletic by a reporter named tyler dunn [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=16.48s)]
*  About a motivational speech delivered by buffalo bill's head coach. Sean mcdermott. I think in 2019 [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  This is from the article mcdermott's morning address began innocently enough. He told the entire team [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  They needed to come together [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  But then sources say he used a strange model the terrorist attacks on september 11th 2001. He cited [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=31.36s)]
*  He cited the hijackers as a group of people who are all about to get on the same page [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  To orchestrate attacks to perfection one by one mcdermott started asking specific players in the room questions [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=42.24s)]
*  What tactics do you think they use to come together a young player tried to answer? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=48.96s)]
*  What do you think their biggest obstacle was a veteran answered tsa [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=53.52s)]
*  Uh, I guess he was uh, was he before it was the cool thing. Uh, was he getting into the bin laden? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  Uh fatwa or whatever it was a good point. He was probably on tiktok. Yeah, maybe he was like early days [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=65.60000000000001s)]
*  You know what you just explained this whole thing [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=71.28s)]
*  That's like a parody of a terrible head coach motivational speech. Yeah, like [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=73.92s)]
*  I I if someone wrote that in a movie i'm not sure I would believe it. I would not believe it [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, but do you feel pumped up? I'm fired up. Are you ready to go? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=82.88s)]
*  Can you be my mahammed auto or whatever? No, let's do it. Okay for the record. We didn't go there [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=86.47999999999999s)]
*  We're moving on from that. All right, we're going to cover all the latest from gaza the biden administration's shifting messaging [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=90.8s)]
*  But maybe not so shifting tactics [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=96.88s)]
*  President zelensky's visit to dc in the fate of funding for ukraine the latest from the un climate change summit [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  Not great news there why people are worried about venezuela potentially invading its neighbor guayana [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=104.72s)]
*  uh mass candidates [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=110.0s)]
*  And cameo causing people problems all over the world then and then crooked media's own max fisher is going to join to talk about [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=111.76s)]
*  The just absurd number of elections happening in 2024. Yeah, but some of them [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I don't know that the outcome of the russian election is so much doubt, you know [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=123.12s)]
*  So it's like when I hear the the statistic, you know half the world is having elections. It's kind of like well [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=127.76s)]
*  They're not all like, uh, yeah equally contested. Let's just varying levels of free and fair. Yes, but uh important nonetheless [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=132.79999999999998s)]
*  So we're excited for that, but let's start with gaza [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=139.44s)]
*  Because what we're like two months into the war now a little more and I don't think you can overstate [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  Uh how bad the situation on the ground currently is so the official casualty estimates are as high as 18 000 dead [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=148.24s)]
*  The idf told cnn that they estimate they've killed 7 000 hamas fighters [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=156.32s)]
*  Which means the majority of the rest killed or the majority of the total killed are civilians [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=160.96s)]
*  And by the way, there's likely hundreds if not thousands of people still trapped in the rubble that we just don't know about [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=165.68s)]
*  The world health organization says they've recorded [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=170.32s)]
*  369 000 cases of infectious diseases since the war started and that figure does not include northern gaza because it's been totally cut off [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=173.74s)]
*  There are also outbreaks of lice [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  Scabies, uh, the water supply has been polluted by raw sewage by dead bodies by god knows what else [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=184.0s)]
*  Those who followed orders early on in this conflict and fled their homes [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=189.84s)]
*  Are now trying to figure out how to survive in december when it's much colder and they don't have the appropriate clothes [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=194.24s)]
*  They don't have blankets. There are dire shortages of food and water even in refugee camps where people were told to go [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=199.52s)]
*  The world food program reported that 83 percent of households in southern gaza have inadequate food consumption [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=205.60000000000002s)]
*  And 38 are suffering from severe levels of hunger [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=211.36s)]
*  And the military campaign is still ongoing there are still massive airstrikes the siege of major population centers [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=214.88s)]
*  Israeli troops were reportedly hunting for hamas's top leader in gaza the alleged mastermind of the october 7th attacks yaga sinwar [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=221.51999999999998s)]
*  We just saw an article that neither was had time to read yet that the idf is starting to flood [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=228.64s)]
*  The hamas tunnel infrastructure with seawater really wonder what that means for hostages if they're in there [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=233.76s)]
*  and then then in the past few days there have been these videos emerging on social media of [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=240.24s)]
*  Semi-naked palestinian men blindfolded in sitting in a row on streets in gaza or being backed into [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=244.22s)]
*  Israeli army trucks are being essentially just held there by the idf the idf says these are members of hamas who had surrendered but news reports [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=251.12s)]
*  uh identified a number of civilians including a journalist and a un un worker so [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  Nowhere does it seem like there's enough aid getting in? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=263.76s)]
*  Uh the list of horribles could go further, but i'll just pause there the key point here is [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=266.24s)]
*  That you know with a brief exception of the ceasefire period every week the humanitarian situation is getting worse and worse [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=271.52s)]
*  And at some point experts are warning it is just going to collapse [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=278.64s)]
*  And you may see the mass death of civilians from disease or starvation and it's just you know [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=282.23999999999995s)]
*  It's an indefensible policy at this point. It doesn't seem like there's any end in sight beyond some sort of capture or killing of sinwar [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=288.4s)]
*  Yeah, the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=296.56s)]
*  You know the brief pause, uh was followed by [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=297.76s)]
*  The kind of full continuation of the military operation like we talked about last week [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=301.03999999999996s)]
*  There wasn't any effort to kind of recalibrate it based on all the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=305.28s)]
*  U.s. You know messaging about the need to protect civilians, which i'm sure we'll talk about here [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=309.59999999999997s)]
*  Um, I think the important point that you hit on is that there's like an exponential way in which the situation is deteriorating though [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=315.91999999999996s)]
*  um, it's not just [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=322.4s)]
*  The horrific nature of bombs falling on [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=325.2s)]
*  civilians, uh [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=328.85999999999996s)]
*  It's also this increasing factor of food [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=330.64s)]
*  and disease [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=334.72s)]
*  and the kind of thing that could make this a [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=336.24s)]
*  totally [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  Unique and unmitigated kind of humanitarian catastrophe in a condensed incredibly condensed space [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=340.4s)]
*  Keeping in mind that people can't get out. They have nowhere to go. They can't go to egypt [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=346.4s)]
*  They can't obviously go into israel. They can't there's nowhere for them to go. They're trapped in there [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=349.6s)]
*  As this military operation proceeds to people who've been [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=353.6s)]
*  You know questioning the death toll [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  I [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=360.96s)]
*  We should be i'd be very careful about that because I expect that it's higher. I did too much higher [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=361.92s)]
*  There there's people [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=368.8s)]
*  in rubble [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=370.96s)]
*  almost certainly [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=372.48s)]
*  uh, and and it's a completely chaotic situation and the health infrastructure is breaking down so [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=373.84000000000003s)]
*  um, yeah, you captured it tomia this is [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=380.0s)]
*  This is a a real human human catastrophe that we're watching unfold before our eyes [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=383.44s)]
*  And so, you know last week we talked about how the biden administration's rhetoric on gaza was slowly and incrementally shifting [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=388.0s)]
*  That included this warning from louis austin the secretary of defense that israel could suffer a strategic defeat if they don't do a better job [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=394.96s)]
*  protecting civilians [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=402.24s)]
*  Um more recently biden warned I think it was a fundraising event the other day biden warned that israel was losing support [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=403.68s)]
*  From europe and other parts of the world because of quote indiscriminate bombing [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=409.59999999999997s)]
*  Biden also said there is disagreement about the day after hamas and I hope that we will reach agreement here as well [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=413.36s)]
*  Uh, and he said netanyahu needs to change up his cabinet and get rid of right-wing ministers like itamar ben gavir [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=419.04s)]
*  But of course, like I mentioned, uh biden said this at a campaign fundraiser. There's no tv footage that we know of [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=423.92s)]
*  It wasn't some major speech. There's done. There's no coverage of it [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=429.2s)]
*  But the u.s action still are fully supportive of israel [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=432.88s)]
*  Last friday the u.s vetoed a un security council resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in gaza [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=436.48s)]
*  That vote was 13 to 1 with the u.s being the only country to vote no in the uk abstaining [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=441.36s)]
*  Uh, the security council called that meeting after the un secretary general invoked this rarely used authority [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=446.8s)]
*  He has to warn quote. There is a high risk of the total collapse of the humanitarian support system in gaza [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=452.88s)]
*  But then later that friday the u.s pushed through the sale of 13 000 rounds of tank ammunition to israel valued at about 100 million dollars [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=459.28000000000003s)]
*  Um, the state department invoked a provision of the arms export control act that allows them to bypass congress in an emergency [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=467.28s)]
*  Here's a clip of secretary of state tony blinken talking about the transfer of those tank rounds from over the weekend [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=473.68s)]
*  When it comes to the weapons that we transfer [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=480.48s)]
*  There are rules that go along with them. Those rules apply to israel as they do to any other country including [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=482.88s)]
*  The way they're used [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=487.6s)]
*  And the need the imperative of respecting international humanitarian law in the case of these particular weapons that you [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=489.12s)]
*  That you mentioned israel is in uh combat right now [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=496.8s)]
*  With amos a group that viciously attacked it on october 7th [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=501.28000000000003s)]
*  That has said that it given the opportunity it will repeat october 7th again and again and again [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=505.2s)]
*  That continues to launch rockets against israeli civilians [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=510.48s)]
*  and [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=514.64s)]
*  We want to make sure that israel has what it needs to defend itself against amos a small portion [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=515.52s)]
*  Of what has been requested is going through on an emergency basis. That is [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=522.0s)]
*  um [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=526.32s)]
*  Moving moving quickly so that israel can have what it needs in hand, but virtually everything else [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=527.6s)]
*  Is going through the regular order through congress, so they're still seeking an additional [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=534.08s)]
*  I think 14 billion or so in uh in security systems the washington post reported that israel used us supplied white phosphorus munitions in southern lebanon [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=538.16s)]
*  This probably happened back in in october [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=546.48s)]
*  Injured nine civilians the type of shell that basically ejects cloth soaked in white phosphorus that burns [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=549.52s)]
*  Creates lots of smoke to obscure troop movements [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=555.52s)]
*  But it burns as hot as 1500 degrees causing severe injuries and fires and misuse of those shells could be a war crime [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=558.32s)]
*  The white house says they're investigating so ben I lay all that out [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=563.76s)]
*  Because the administration's rhetoric is slowly shifting but the world is seeing these actions, right? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=567.12s)]
*  Where the world is seeing this the veto the weapon shipment the white phosphorus reports [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=571.6s)]
*  They're not it kind of doesn't matter what biden says at a closed door fundraiser. Yeah, there's two reasons [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=576.16s)]
*  You know for the shift in tone from the administration we've talked before about how they [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=581.92s)]
*  They themselves described their approach as kind of hugging bb hugging israel in public and delivering this advice in private and [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=586.24s)]
*  And then presumably reading out that on background [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=592.8000000000001s)]
*  But there are two reasons that you would calibrate your messaging as the administration has around the need to limit civilian casualties and follow laws of war [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=596.48s)]
*  And loyd austin's warning [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=603.6s)]
*  One is to try to affect [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=606.16s)]
*  bb netanyahu's behavior [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=608.4s)]
*  And thus far I think it's you know clear that there's been no effect on bb netanyahu's behavior [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=611.12s)]
*  They've not adjusted their tactics at all [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=616.72s)]
*  and then the second is [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=619.28s)]
*  To kind of send a message to the world [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=620.9599999999999s)]
*  that [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=623.4399999999999s)]
*  We don't approve of everything that israel's doing that we understand the humanitarian [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=624.48s)]
*  Disaster in gaza. We're trying to address that [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=629.52s)]
*  the problem is [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=632.8s)]
*  The world doesn't care that you're saying that if your actions are you're vetoing a ceasefire at the un [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=634.72s)]
*  And you're expediting the delivery of the weapons that are being used in the military operation [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=641.52s)]
*  They are behind they're they're weeks behind, you know, uh the the there's no credit for [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=648.4s)]
*  You know reading out that, you know, you'd like them to do something differently. I the other challenge I have is that [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=655.2s)]
*  if [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=660.96s)]
*  You're saying that more needs to be done to protect civilians and you're saying that you'll still deliver these weapons [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=662.48s)]
*  And you're saying that you won't put any conditions on those weapons [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=668.48s)]
*  Then then what is your leverage? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=671.9200000000001s)]
*  It just there's a complete discordance between saying that you don't think they're doing enough to protect civilians [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=674.32s)]
*  But saying we're still going to deliver all this and hold them to the same standard that we hold others to because you're not holding them [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=679.44s)]
*  To the same standards that you're holding others to because if we were saying about anybody else [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=685.28s)]
*  That we delivered weapons to that we don't think they're doing enough to protect civilians [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=689.44s)]
*  that presumably there'd be a halt on those deliveries and some conditions attached to it and so [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=692.6400000000001s)]
*  There's at some point [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=698.0s)]
*  You have to say publicly [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=700.0s)]
*  What you would like to see differently not just we you know, the that we do not agree with x [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=702.8000000000001s)]
*  We do not agree with y we'd like to see this instead [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=708.1600000000001s)]
*  And they have to get there [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=711.9200000000001s)]
*  Because the current situation [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=714.96s)]
*  It's just not tenable to to try to have it both ways to say [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=717.2s)]
*  We hug bb. We won't criticize him in public. We won't impose any conditions on things [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=720.64s)]
*  but we're concerned about these things that we're seeing, you know, and I want to give one example on weapons, too because [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=726.24s)]
*  you know [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=731.52s)]
*  These huge bombs these thousand and two thousand pound bombs [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=732.64s)]
*  These you'll remember tommy this was came up at the obama administration these so-called bunker buster weapons that israel wanted [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=736.08s)]
*  These were meant the case that israel made for why they wanted for instance those weapons [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=742.0s)]
*  was [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=747.0400000000001s)]
*  And this is not a secret. I mean, this is I think would just be logic, you know [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=748.72s)]
*  If there was some contingency around like a deep underground iranian nuclear facility or something, you know [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=753.52s)]
*  It was not intended that this would be dropped on civilian population or hardened military targets [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=758.72s)]
*  Against hesbola. Yeah. Yeah, but to drop this in the middle a 2,000 pound bomb getting dropped in the middle of a crowded urban center [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=764.0s)]
*  I mean that remember the attacks we talked about on the refugee camp [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=771.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's really like a refugee camp that has been built up and built up over decades [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=774.08s)]
*  It's one of the most densely populated parts of gaza city the drop the idea of drop two [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=777.44s)]
*  2,000 pound bombs. Yeah on that refugee camp and and I just think the [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=782.22s)]
*  The the rationalizations that have to be done to justify that kind of destruction on civilians [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=787.2s)]
*  Is not healthy [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=794.24s)]
*  Uh, it's not healthy for the united states. It's not healthy healthy for israel [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=795.6s)]
*  And it's certainly not going to make it any easier to establish the kind of durable peace that can ultimately secure israel [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=799.52s)]
*  as well, so I [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=807.52s)]
*  I just think at some point [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=809.4399999999999s)]
*  You know that there has to be an acknowledgement of differences with netanyahu and frankly [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=811.52s)]
*  I think the reality is that you know israel will be better served with a different prime minister [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=816.4799999999999s)]
*  We've talked a lot about how the israeli people themselves seem to understand that based on bb's approval rating being at historic lows [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=820.2399999999999s)]
*  um, so I don't [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=827.76s)]
*  I I know this this paradigm is going to need to change something's got to change [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=829.2800000000001s)]
*  Or else there's just going to be more of the same week after week after week with more and more people dying [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=833.12s)]
*  And we cannot underestimate I think how consequential moment this might be for the united states. I mean [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=837.6800000000001s)]
*  the global south [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=843.12s)]
*  Forget the global south. I mean europe. I mean [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=844.72s)]
*  This is a situation where we are so out of step [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=847.5200000000001s)]
*  And just saying that you know, the international community is losing patience that there's no it's it's well beyond that [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=850.88s)]
*  I think people are looking at this and think what is going on here? You know, yeah [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=855.68s)]
*  I mean from an american perspective we can judge the biden administration on words [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=858.88s)]
*  Actions and results on the grounds. Yeah, the words are slowly shifting at the cabinet level less so from biden himself [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=863.92s)]
*  But the actions like you said are still just kind of [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=871.04s)]
*  on on autopilot, they're just on autopilot. They're on autopilot, you know, and it's uh, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=874.9599999999999s)]
*  How long is that autopilot stay on? You know because [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=880.24s)]
*  Now it's tank munitions, it's security council vetoes, then it's you know, maybe 14 billion dollars and further military assistance [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=883.92s)]
*  And again, I don't if you're saying that more needs to be done to protect civilians [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=891.76s)]
*  But there's no conditions on the military aid. We're giving you that has not been used in a way to protect civilians [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=895.6s)]
*  You know that becomes any reconcilable rift between the words and the actions [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=902.0s)]
*  And again, you know, I think the mistake I think we sometimes make is that [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=905.92s)]
*  Assuming that joe biden has total control over bb netanyahu. I don't think that is entirely true. I think the administration could have said [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=910.2399999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of things that are obviously telling them to do that. The israeli government is not listening to right? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=918.16s)]
*  But I do think at this point [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=922.9599999999999s)]
*  That a little more pressure [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=925.8399999999999s)]
*  Could go a long way. I do think you could convince the war cabinet two months into this conflict that they have to stop [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=928.0799999999999s)]
*  I mean there's precedent here of reagan [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=934.7199999999999s)]
*  Shouting down the israeli leadership and demanding an end to bombing runs in the 80s. I mean it's happened before [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=936.88s)]
*  Yeah, I think I mean you're right to point out [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=943.2s)]
*  But I I don't think that this is what joe biden wants to be happening in gaza, you know, so like that [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=945.6s)]
*  And people may disagree. I'm sure people some people do but [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=952.4s)]
*  I don't think this is like their preferred [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=956.24s)]
*  Uh course of action. I believe that they're saying these things in private [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=958.08s)]
*  The question is what do you do when bb netanyahu continues to ignore what you say? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=961.9200000000001s)]
*  And and here's the thing, you know, some people will say [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=966.96s)]
*  well, there's not really any leverage, you know, it's not worth criticizing them in public because [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=969.9200000000001s)]
*  Um, you know, he's gonna do what he's gonna do anyway. First of all, I think it does matter like getting on the record [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=975.12s)]
*  You know if there's a difference but also like there wouldn't be such an effort to try to prevent the administration [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=980.64s)]
*  from I mean the [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=986.4s)]
*  I remember when the u.s. Obstained on a security council resolution at the end of the obama administration and it was like, you know [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=988.4s)]
*  uh [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=994.1600000000001s)]
*  The the you know, it was a huge negative reaction [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=996.16s)]
*  Which indicates that they do care about that kind of international isolation, you know, and [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=999.76s)]
*  And so there there there is meaningful [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1005.4399999999999s)]
*  Leverage, you know, the u.s. Is really the last holdout maybe with the uk to some extent [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1008.3s)]
*  I mean france's first ceasefire, you know like [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1013.36s)]
*  If you started to shift your public positioning around these issues [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1016.56s)]
*  It's just a fact that it would be harder [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1021.28s)]
*  For israel to sustain this scale of military operation over time. I just I refuse to believe that's not the case [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1023.6s)]
*  um kind of announcing that you have no leverage is is [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1029.52s)]
*  Is a self-fulfilling prophecy. That's exactly right. That's right [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1032.96s)]
*  And there's still a huge amount of disagreement over what to do the day after this war is over [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1035.52s)]
*  Netanyahu is still saying that hamas will not be in control nor will fatah [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1040.0s)]
*  Uh the palestinian authorities, you know the political rivals [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1044.72s)]
*  There are still these attacks from the hufi rebels in yemen [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1049.28s)]
*  on uh commercial ships [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1053.1200000000001s)]

*  Somehow it was damaged but no one died you're starting to see strikes in the west bank [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1060.4s)]
*  And then civil disobedience and then ben, you know, it's not talked about enough [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1065.6000000000001s)]
*  63 journalists have been killed in gaza [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1069.9s)]
*  and you and I think have both noticed [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1073.28s)]
*  the amount of solidarity that journalists who have been [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1076.32s)]
*  Detained by the russian government get from the sort of western press corps compared the amount of coverage and solidarity those 63 journalists get [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1080.72s)]
*  It's pretty stark. There's really not as much of a conversation about [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1088.08s)]
*  Just the unbelievable number of journalists who have been killed mostly palestinian journalists in this conflict [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1093.28s)]
*  Yeah, and and and it runs the gamut too because there've been also journalists killed in and southern lebanon [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1099.4399999999998s)]

*  It's it's really striking that there's so much [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1110.8799999999999s)]
*  outrage [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1115.9199999999998s)]
*  Understandably and rightly on behalf of journalists who are targeted or journalists who are taken [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1117.5s)]
*  as in russia [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1123.76s)]
*  What is different here that that that there's not the similar, you know, and and [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1126.32s)]
*  sometimes the messaging is well, some of these journalists are too cozy with hamas, but [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1131.9199999999998s)]
*  You know what like that's [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1136.48s)]
*  You could adjudicate one by one out of the 63 that is clearly not the case for all these journalists, you know [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1138.96s)]
*  A lot of these are like well-known journalists too. Like these are people that have been around there [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1144.24s)]
*  They're not just people that threw on like a press vest, you know when this conflict started [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1148.32s)]
*  And they're they're suffering a horrific toll [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1152.8s)]

*  The lack of similar outrage [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1167.5200000000002s)]
*  In other sectors of u.s society about what's happening to to journalists in this case or what's just happening in general inside of gaza. So [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1170.64s)]

*  Of gaza, so let's let's turn to ukraine. Um as we're recording this president zelensky's in washington [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1314.48s)]
*  He met with some republican leaders in the senate and then he's going to meet with uh, uh, speaker johnson the new speaker of the house [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1319.76s)]
*  The biden administration recently sent a letter to all of all members of congress saying they're about to be out of funding for ukraine [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1325.6s)]
*  So far congress has authorized about 111 billion for ukraine. Biden has asked for another 61 billion that that additional [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1331.2s)]
*  Uh request was bundled into this larger spending package that includes aid to israel and some changes to immigration policies and border security funding, etc [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1338.88s)]
*  Uh, the zelensky's visit to the u.s [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1346.88s)]
*  Comes as there's all this reporting about how the ukrainian counter-offensive has failed that we can get into in a bit [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1349.52s)]
*  but you know, let's just talk about ben the implications of [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1354.96s)]
*  This funding getting cut off first because I do think you know [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1358.0s)]
*  Like if congress punts the funding request the next year but like deals with it in january [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1361.1200000000001s)]
*  People i've talked to suggest they'll be fine. Yeah, but if the funding never gets passed. I do think you will see ukraine [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1365.1200000000001s)]
*  Run out of ammo over the next three or four months [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1371.76s)]
*  They'll have weapon systems breaking down that they can't fix [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1374.56s)]
*  They will not even become be close to be able to match russia's artillery fire. So you will probably see population centers [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1377.28s)]
*  Uh be less and less well defended from you know, by missile defense systems you will see [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1384.96s)]
*  Uh the ukrainian side have to give up territory. They've taken or retaken [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1390.16s)]
*  Zelensky probably uh reportedly told the some of the center republicans that they'd have to shift to guerrilla warfare [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1394.88s)]
*  So it doesn't sound like he's prepared to give up in any way [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1400.08s)]
*  He just will shift tactics and then the white house's broader argument is that once russia takes ukraine [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1402.48s)]
*  They'll basically just continue marching west into poland or some other nato country and then we'll get drawn into the war [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1408.08s)]
*  And I do think that you know that can sound a little hyperbolic maybe but it is worth noting [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1413.2s)]
*  How weak the european defense systems are and the capabilities the wall street journal had a piece on [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1418.56s)]
*  some of the european military spending and [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1426.32s)]
*  The uk is the biggest spender on defense in europe, but they have only 150 deployable tanks [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1428.96s)]
*  And it said perhaps a dozen serviceable long-range artillery pieces. So not much france is the next biggest spender [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1436.0s)]
*  They have fewer than 90 heavy artillery pieces which the journal says is equivalent to what russia loses roughly every month on the battlefield [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1441.8400000000001s)]
*  in ukraine [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1449.28s)]
*  Germany's army has enough ammunition for two days of battle says this journal piece [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1450.4s)]
*  Uh, the u.s accounts for 70 of all nato spending last year military spending among nato countries fell from 3 of gdp [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1455.2s)]
*  During the cold war to 1.3 in 2014 in the past decade it has increased 20 [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1461.76s)]
*  But over that same period russia has increased its defense budget by nearly 300 [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1466.96s)]
*  So pretty stark contrast there [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1472.64s)]
*  Ben, what do you think the stakes are of this spending vote and the best way to argue on behalf of them? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1475.52s)]
*  Well, I I do think that it's existential to the ukrainians that this assistance continues [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1482.96s)]
*  and maybe it doesn't have to be the full 60 billion, but [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1488.88s)]
*  look the u.s is supplying the bulk of [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1491.8400000000001s)]
*  ukrainian armaments and what russia's been able to do is they've been able [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1496.4s)]
*  To create a foundation to rearm on a regular basis [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1500.96s)]
*  Number one because they basically made a third of their spending on defense and so that's churning out [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1504.72s)]
*  Ammunition shells the kinds of things that they need to support their war effort [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1511.18s)]
*  Supplemented by the assistance that they got from north korea, which is a lot of these types of smaller, you know [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1515.1000000000001s)]
*  Which is hugely important hugely important because you know north korea is now [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1521.36s)]
*  Basically this other funnel of weapons and then the iranians are this funnel of drones. So so russia's kind of figured out [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1524.8s)]
*  How to rearm itself? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1530.6399999999999s)]
*  They have a bigger population so they and prudence doesn't give a shit how many casualties he takes [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1533.12s)]
*  And so it's pretty obvious that their strategy is to just grind down the ukrainian defenses [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1538.4799999999998s)]
*  Rearm and wait out like the spigot turning off from the u.s in europe [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1543.26s)]
*  At the same time that the u.s is held up in congress [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1548.2399999999998s)]
*  Victor urban because the u.s has kind of consensus decision making he's blocking and obstructing some of the assistance flowing in from europe [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1551.36s)]
*  There are ways around that but it's kind of interesting that like victor urbans playing the role of the house republican caucus inside of europe [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1558.32s)]
*  You know, um, and he's in dc right now [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1564.1599999999999s)]
*  I think and he's in dc right now trying to like, you know figure out a way to block, you know, our congressional spending [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1566.08s)]
*  um, but by the way, that should tell you a lot, you know, like [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1571.6s)]
*  The the argument I make is that this is a lifeline to ukrainians. And by the way [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1574.8799999999999s)]
*  Given all these since we've already provided to them [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1578.96s)]
*  Why why would we want to step back and let that collapse? You know, I mean we've invested a lot in ukraine's sovereignty and its survival [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1581.6s)]
*  Um, and and the stakes could not be higher [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1588.6399999999999s)]
*  um, I I think also [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1591.84s)]
*  look i'm not one of these people that [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1593.76s)]
*  thinks, you know putin is going to march all the way across europe, but [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1595.9199999999998s)]
*  In addition, obviously the stakes for the ukrainians [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1599.76s)]
*  Um one [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1601.94s)]
*  I think he would have this platform to just start messing with nato and the baltic countries for instance [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1604.66s)]
*  Lithuania latvia estonia, you could start to see [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1610.96s)]
*  Cyber attacks and cross-border actions kind of testing of nato's red lines, you know efforts to create, you know [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1614.5s)]
*  russian speaking separatists in different places [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1620.66s)]
*  You could see that kind of probing that in ways that could escalate into an outright conflict [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1624.42s)]
*  You could see him waiting out to see the u.s. Election and if trump wins well, then yeah, that's right. I mean if trump wins [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1628.82s)]
*  Maybe he does move on because he doesn't think you and he rightly would think that trump wouldn't come to the defense of nato ally [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1636.1s)]
*  And I think that's that's probably true, you know [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1642.1799999999998s)]
*  So so there is something to be worried about here and and again like if the message essentially is [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1644.82s)]
*  You know, you can wait out the the the world that cares about this [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1650.58s)]
*  Which essentially the the democratic allies are supporting ukraine [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1654.8999999999999s)]
*  That they can sustain interest in something for like a year or two and then then you know get exhausted by it [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1658.1000000000001s)]
*  Well, yeah, then the message to russia is I mean i'm not usually one of these people that's like there's magical thinking [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1663.8600000000001s)]
*  And then the chinese limbi taiwan, but I do think in this case with at least putin the message to putin is yeah [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1669.14s)]
*  You can wait out and then keep pushing and keep pushing. Yeah push and push. Yeah, the north korea piece of this is so interesting [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1674.9s)]
*  I also read that south korea eventually became a larger supplier of artillery ammunition for ukraine than all [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1679.78s)]
*  European nations combined because they just had such a stockpile from the war [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1685.7s)]
*  The us in concert with this visit from zelensky released a newly declassified intelligence report that said russia has lost 87 [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1689.14s)]
*  Of the active duty ground troops that had prior to the invasion and two-thirds of its pre-invasion tanks [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1696.66s)]
*  However, they've conscripted tons of people in their industrial bases ramping up and creating more tanks [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1701.8600000000001s)]
*  But you know the more specifically they said that of the 360 000 troops that entered ukraine [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1707.38s)]
*  Including contract and conscript personnel russia lost [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1712.9s)]
*  315 000 on the battlefield according to this assessment. I think that means killed or wounded not 315 000 killed but still a staggering number [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1717.28s)]
*  Um, and you know, they're currently still occupying 20 percent of ukraine [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1725.62s)]
*  but you know the the challenge for biden and zelensky on this visit politically is [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1729.46s)]
*  They are getting different demands from different parts of the republican party, right? You got the speaker or the house saying [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1734.18s)]
*  We need a clear articulation of the strategy for how ukraine is going to win which sounds reasonable [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1740.1000000000001s)]
*  But I think he's setting up a scenario where he can say [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1744.58s)]
*  They didn't give me the information I wanted, you know, so I can't support more funding. The senate side is different because [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1749.06s)]
*  They want senate republicans want ukraine aid to be coupled with border security in some reforms to the asylum process [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1754.82s)]
*  Those talks are ongoing [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1760.98s)]
*  In serious, but they seem to be stalled here's a supercut of senator lindsey graham [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1763.0600000000002s)]
*  Uh james lankford and eric schmidt talking about some of those talks [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1768.1000000000001s)]
*  If you don't use your executive tools or work with us for a statutory solution [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1771.38s)]
*  None of us who are supportive of ukraine israel and taiwan can vote [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1776.02s)]
*  On a supplemental because you're making us pick [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1781.22s)]
*  countries abroad over our own homeland [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1784.88s)]
*  Security we understand the threat that president zelensky's faced and is continues to face [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1788.5s)]
*  We provided aid for a year and a half at this point to be able to help them in every way that we possibly can [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1793.22s)]
*  That aid will continue to be able to come but we can't just ignore what's happening in our country [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1798.26s)]
*  While we're helping other people with theirs left a meeting with [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1802.9s)]
*  president zelensky [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1806.0s)]
*  Uh as we're talking about ukraine and their borders [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1807.54s)]
*  But joe biden, the president of this country is totally absent [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1811.0600000000002s)]
*  In talking about the sovereignty of our world [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1815.7s)]
*  I saw that politico reported that some of the republican senators raised border security questions with zelensky [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1818.5s)]
*  Like what the fuck was he supposed to say? I'm like, yeah, i'm worried about your border, too [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1824.8200000000002s)]
*  I i'd say, you know first of all, um [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1828.3400000000001s)]
*  On the expectation setting because I think this is important, you know biden said, uh today with zelensky [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1832.18s)]
*  That winning, you know winning means ukraine is a sovereign independent nation [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1837.8600000000001s)]
*  That's a good answer from joe biden [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1841.62s)]
*  because I think the way when people were more [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1843.62s)]
*  Kind of euphoric and and and thinking that russia was about to collapse all territory [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1846.82s)]
*  It was all territory and I don't I think part of the problem here is expectations were set too high for this counteroffensive [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1851.86s)]
*  More by the ukrainians. I the biden people have actually been quite careful about expectation setting [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1858.26s)]
*  um, and and that's not look obviously i'd like russia range of territory [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1863.7s)]
*  But I think part of the problem is if you set a political objective that is not attainable in any kind of near-term future [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1868.34s)]
*  It's easier for critics to say wait a second. We're failing. Why do we keep putting more? [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1873.7s)]
*  Money into this and and it's just prolonging this war [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1878.02s)]
*  There has to be an effort to kind of shift gears here [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1881.06s)]
*  It's about holding the territory ukraine has fortifying ukraine what they have [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1884.34s)]
*  Bringing them closer into europe bringing them on a track to the european union and yes [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1889.62s)]
*  Maybe giving them some capacity to inflict damage on russians in Crimea or to take back certain areas if their opportunity presents itself [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1893.3799999999999s)]
*  But it's a different definition than we were at previously [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1900.82s)]
*  Then I think on this border stuff [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1905.46s)]
*  What's hard in listening to that beyond having to listen to lindsey graham's voice? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1908.1s)]
*  Um is it's a very effective political message [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1912.1s)]
*  But it is a very dangerous [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1916.18s)]
*  I mean, it's it's just not the case. It's kind of what they do with the debt ceiling where they try to negotiate something [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1918.5800000000002s)]
*  Whether you it's just not the case that you say, you know what in order to do [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1925.14s)]
*  This thing that that even I want you to do in foreign policy [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1929.7s)]
*  You have to make like these massive concessions over here. It sets like a weird precedent, you know, it'd be like obama saying like i'll only [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1933.7s)]
*  Fund the war in afghanistan if you all vote for obamacare. I mean, I mean which maybe I should have done [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1943.0600000000002s)]
*  No, it's a manufactured rationale. It's a manufactured rationale [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1948.8200000000002s)]
*  The one thing I will say on the substance of it is like I think absolutely the democrats may need to make some pretty significant [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1950.9s)]
*  concessions on border security and funding for border security and [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1956.5s)]
*  It's when it gets into these structural changes if someone's watching this is like well, why not just concede to it? [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1960.18s)]
*  some of the things the republicans are proposing are like [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1965.22s)]
*  Massive structural changes in how immigration works in this country like essentially the president giving up certain basic authorities that [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1968.26s)]
*  Presidents always had or essentially doing away with the asylum system entirely which is kind of part of our obligations to [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1974.98s)]
*  you know the old international system of migration that breaks down if suddenly that goes away and so [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1982.98s)]
*  It's there's just some things that democrats are not going to be able to concede here and that that's why [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1988.9s)]
*  The funding for ukraine may actually very well be in doubt here [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1993.86s)]
*  Yeah, i'm worried that the republican senate demands even the mit romney's of the world are looking for some really maximalist [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=1996.82s)]
*  Yeah changes there's a version of this you could imagine where biden gets what he wants for ukraine funding [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2002.66s)]
*  They make some incremental changes to asylum policy and biden decides [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2007.7s)]
*  That's a really good deal for me because I can say in the campaign [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2011.94s)]
*  I took care of ukraine and I worked with republicans to secure the border [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2015.0600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, but my concern is more that like the mike johnsons of the world that represent the mago wing of the party [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2018.5s)]
*  Basically just want to cut the cord on ukraine and will not help out joe biden in any way, but we'll I guess we'll see [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2023.54s)]
*  Yeah [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2030.1s)]
*  Yeah, they want to be able to say they'll just keep moving the goalposts on the immigration stuff to where he can't accept it [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2030.82s)]
*  So that they have the argument that's the alternative what you said which is that hey we were trying to protect this border [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2036.4199999999998s)]
*  And all I cared about is ukraine. Yeah meanwhile in russia [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2040.6599999999999s)]
*  The russian supreme court recently labeled the lgbtq movement as an extremist organization and banned it basically effectively [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2043.3s)]
*  Outlawed advocacy on behalf of gay lesbian or transgender people in russia [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2050.2599999999998s)]
*  You can now go to jail for up to four years for wearing a rainbow flag and on top of that [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2054.3399999999997s)]
*  Uh jailed opposition leader alexei navalny has reportedly gone missing within the russian prison system [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2059.3s)]
*  His team has not been able to reach him for a week [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2064.5800000000004s)]
*  Uh, he was assumed to be in a penal colony about 150 miles east of moscow [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2067.1400000000003s)]
*  Serving out the multiple bullshit sentences. He's received on bullshit charges, but uh, it's pretty ominous that they can't find him [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2071.86s)]
*  It's really ominous because this hasn't happened before and his team has voiced a lot of concern about not even being able to be in touch with him [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2078.5s)]
*  And and suggested he was in poor health [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2085.94s)]
*  I mean, I do think it's worth pointing out that we talked about all the ways in which time is beginning to work against ukrainians [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2088.3399999999997s)]
*  Yes, pudin has kind of cracked down on dissent. Yes pudin has got this kind of pipeline of military assistance [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2096.2599999999998s)]
*  But he's also spending a third of his government [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2101.46s)]
*  Spending a budget on defense. He's got these record number of casualties [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2104.98s)]
*  I think it's wrong to assume that like pudin's sitting high, you know pretty you know, like he he's [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2109.54s)]
*  but there there there should be like like a [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2115.7s)]
*  An appropriate degree of understanding of of what russia's been able to do to fortify its position [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2120.5s)]
*  Without kind of once again building pudin up into being 100 feet tall and because if you do that then it's like well [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2126.18s)]
*  You know then then it feels like it's futile to even be standing up to the guy [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2132.98s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I I think you're right. I think the other side of that argument is [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2137.22s)]
*  um [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2141.62s)]
*  That some in the west underestimated the amount of pain pudin was willing to inflict on his own people and the power of [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2142.5s)]
*  relentless all-consuming propaganda [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2150.08s)]
*  To smooth over. Yeah, and if you look at russia's history like their bet is always like, you know [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2152.74s)]
*  Our army may suffer massive casualties, but we grind you down and reach out and that's what they did in world war two [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2158.18s)]
*  And that's now now that failed in things like afghanistan in the 80s. So it's not like that's always worked for them [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2164.42s)]
*  But yeah, they've clearly [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2171.2200000000003s)]
*  There's an infinite threshold for the pain that laden repudin is willing to inflict on his own people here [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2173.78s)]
*  speaking of [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2180.1s)]
*  international meetings [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2181.44s)]
*  And initiatives been so the the cop 28 un climate change summit was supposed to be all but wrapped up by now [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2182.98s)]
*  But unfortunately, it basically fell apart on monday after a draft official statement went around to participants [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2190.42s)]
*  That failed to call for a phase out of fossil fuels as we record the climate envoys are still negotiating [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2195.54s)]
*  They're still trying to get a statement that all participants can agree to it's not clear that's going to happen [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2200.9s)]
*  Um listeners have probably heard us talk about this cop 28 before [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2205.94s)]
*  It's in the united arab emirates a country that is rich solely because of natural gas [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2209.54s)]
*  The the cop 28 president is the ceo of an oil company [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2214.34s)]
*  There are reports that saudi arabia was pressuring the cop leadership to drop mentions of phasing out fossil fuels [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2218.6600000000003s)]
*  So we'll see where this lands [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2224.98s)]
*  But what do you think the impact would be if this cop ended without a statement that was calling to phase out fossil fuels? [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2226.42s)]
*  Uh, it'd be very bad, you know, um, you know the the the momentum there's been this effort to kind of generate momentum cop to cop [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2234.66s)]
*  you know, um [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2242.66s)]
*  and then every every five years is meant to be like a big breakthrough like paris was a big breakthrough and [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2244.42s)]
*  Glasgow was kind of supposed to be the next big one and it did accomplish a fair amount [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2250.02s)]
*  But that said tommy like I was glad to see john carrey and others saying like we we want to see a phase out of [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2254.4199999999996s)]
*  fossil fuels in this [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2261.3799999999997s)]
*  I would actually rather [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2262.74s)]
*  Not have some bullshit warmed over communique [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2265.3799999999997s)]
*  um, and and there be a clear [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2268.4199999999996s)]
*  distinction between [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2271.2s)]
*  The countries that want to protect fossil fuels and countries that care like I this may be one where I i'd rather take the pain [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2272.8999999999996s)]
*  And i'm sure they'll probably come up with something they may even by the time this podcast comes out there, you know [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2281.2999999999997s)]
*  but like some wishy washy formula about some some adjective about phasing out fossil fuels, but [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2285.46s)]
*  That said I i'd kind of rather [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2292.2599999999998s)]
*  Not have like a bullshit communique [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2295.7s)]
*  um and and take [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2298.2599999999998s)]
*  Take a have a preponderance of countries taking a stand on principle here [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2300.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, the the problem with um getting everyone to agreement is then you all have to defend it and yeah, obviously [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2303.7s)]
*  We don't want to defend his agreement. That's not going to do anything. Yeah, um, it's being an oil and gas bend [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2308.5s)]
*  So on sunday december 3rd [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2312.66s)]
*  Venezuelans voted in favor of declaring sovereignty over a place called esequibo, which is a resource-rich part of neighboring [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2315.6s)]
*  Guyana makes up about two-thirds of Guyana's total territory [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2322.58s)]
*  Then a few days later [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2326.18s)]
*  Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro said he would authorize oil and gas exploration and create a new state that includes esequibo [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2327.7s)]
*  So just basically annex the place [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2334.42s)]
*  A lot of political observers saw this and got very nervous for a bunch of reasons [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2336.7400000000002s)]
*  It could be about these resources in the territory, but it also could be about [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2342.34s)]
*  Maduro calling a referendum to stir up nationalist ire in advance of the presidential election next year [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2346.7400000000002s)]
*  The international community has been pushing maduro to hold free and fair elections [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2351.86s)]
*  But he's already blocked the popular opposition candidate from running so it's not clear. He's going to hold up to that commitment [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2355.7000000000003s)]
*  It's not totally clear to me if maduro's plan to rile people up worked that well [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2361.06s)]
*  The government claims that 10 and a half million people voted for this referendum [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2365.78s)]
*  It's about half of eligible voters [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2369.06s)]
*  But election observers seem to doubt that turnout was really that high and they might feel shit [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2370.82s)]
*  Regardless, this is not a new dispute [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2375.36s)]
*  Venezuela claims that esequibo was stolen from them back in 1899 when an international tribunal awarded the territory to then british [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2377.36s)]
*  Guyana, Guyana was a british colony until 1966 and then in 2018 [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2384.42s)]
*  Guyana asked the international court of justice the un court to review and settle this dispute [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2388.34s)]
*  But that process is just going to be it's going to take a few years [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2393.7s)]
*  So complicating all of this is that exxon mobile found massive oil reserves off the coast of esequibo [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2396.58s)]
*  Uh back in 2015. There's all kinds of precious metals in this territory [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2402.2599999999998s)]
*  So it's very valuable and in recent years you've seen [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2406.1s)]
*  Guyana's oil industry take off as Venezuela's cratered thanks to sanctions and economic mismanagement [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2409.22s)]
*  On sunday, Guyana agreed to have talks with venezuela over the dispute [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2414.74s)]
*  Brazil had put its military on high alert in case venezuela did something crazy [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2419.14s)]
*  They're going to be an official observer of these talks on the island of st. Vincent [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2424.8199999999997s)]
*  So ben we've talked a lot of times about how broad-based us sanctions [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2428.58s)]
*  On venezuela have failed to dislodge maduro or these terrible leaders, but have really hurt average people [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2433.7s)]
*  Back in october biden started to loosen some of the sanctions on minnesota's oil sector in exchange for maduro agreeing to hold free and fair elections [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2440.18s)]
*  Now he's backsliding on that commitment [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2448.34s)]
*  And he's threatening to annex Guyana [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2450.7400000000002s)]
*  What the hell do you think you do here? Yeah [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2453.38s)]
*  It's like it's like help us help you man. Yeah [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2455.78s)]
*  Well, I I think first of all, it's important. Uh, the brazilian involvement is important because part of what you want to do here is you want to [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2459.1400000000003s)]
*  You want to have other countries in the western hemisphere and latin america? [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2466.42s)]
*  um [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2470.98s)]
*  You know stepping in here, uh to try to deliver their own message to venezuela [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2472.26s)]
*  um, and look, you know [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2478.1000000000004s)]
*  the thing about sanctions is you can always turn them on turn them off, right, but [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2480.82s)]
*  the [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2484.6600000000003s)]
*  Much better to have a coordinated regional response [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2485.94s)]
*  So it's not just like kind of like the u.s coming in being like, oh we're going to slap these sanctions back on [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2488.1800000000003s)]
*  I think what you want is you want to do the kind of diplomacy? [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2492.1800000000003s)]
*  that you know presses [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2495.7000000000003s)]
*  The venezuelans not just with with us and our own sanctions but in concert with these other countries, you know [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2498.34s)]
*  And brazil stepping up, you know, they don't want to see [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2504.5s)]
*  Uh this kind of power grab in the region. We you know, there are other countries. I think that can be listed in this effort as well [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2507.2999999999997s)]
*  Um, and you kind of need that united front to kind of inform penduro's decision-making here [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2514.02s)]
*  Yeah, let's hope these talks go well and he climbs down a little bit [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2519.06s)]
*  Yeah, um two more lighter things before we get to max, uh in a story that sheds light on how dumb most political campaigning has become [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2522.74s)]
*  Uh and how much it's a bunch of marketing stunts some before reported that there are billboards all over cities in gana [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2529.8599999999997s)]
*  Advertising a presidential candidate whose identity is concealed by a mask and not like one of those fun, you know [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2534.98s)]
*  Like little zora ones with the eye holes we're talking about an elaborate mask that covers this person's entire head and face [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2540.1s)]
*  So you really can't tell who it is. Uh gana is a presidential vote coming up in about a year [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2546.74s)]
*  The two main political parties get around 95 of the vote [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2551.38s)]
*  So if it's a new political party being announced, they will face some structural challenges, but who knows maybe it'll work [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2554.34s)]
*  Um the campaign the masked campaign [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2559.46s)]
*  Sorry promises to release the identity of the candidate as soon as possible along with policy objectives and goals [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2561.62s)]
*  A lot of people think this is a well-known businessman known as cheddar. We'll find out I guess but obviously it's stupid [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2567.38s)]
*  It got us to talk about it. Yeah [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2574.2599999999998s)]
*  Uh anybody you want to slap a mask on and run it for president? [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2576.2599999999998s)]
*  Taylor swift that'd be a good one. Well, I think you want mask off for taylor swift, right? [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2579.38s)]
*  The reveal would be iconic. It would be I mean imagine the reveal on that, you know, uh, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2583.62s)]
*  And and she is uh [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2588.02s)]

*  Yeah. Yeah [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2611.46s)]

*  Well, i'm actually not gonna make it the joke about what rudy may do to us if uh, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2640.98s)]
*  Trump wins, it wouldn't be good. Yeah, probably have a couple cocktails. That's about all do [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2644.6600000000003s)]

*  According to a new report released by the microsoft threat analysis center [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=2655.0600000000004s)]

*  That's a good way to put it. So like when I think about [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3027.94s)]
*  What changed and what didn't change in 2023? [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3031.3799999999997s)]
*  Through global elections which leads into what we're going to talk about 2024 [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3035.06s)]
*  There are a few that I think like really exemplify what was happening globally [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3038.98s)]
*  And for me the one that I was kind of most [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3042.02s)]
*  Had my eye on the most and was most anticipating going into 2023 was turkey which I know we talked a lot about right? [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3044.98s)]
*  Recep Tayyip Erdogan 20 years in office becoming increasingly autocratic [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3051.06s)]
*  But it looks like there's this big moment that like maybe this is our chance to kind of get him out of office [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3055.46s)]
*  All the opposition parties come together run against him. The economy is terrible [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3060.74s)]
*  It looks like this might actually be it for him. And of course spoiler alert. He stays in office [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3064.5s)]
*  There's a lot of hope in this room. Yeah, all of us got a little high on our own supply for a few weeks [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3069.3s)]
*  I don't think we were off base. No, we were hopeful to quote, uh, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3074.18s)]
*  George w bush and date myself with this reference you forgot about poland [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3078.02s)]
*  Oh, we're oh, oh we're gonna get to poland. Yeah, okay good [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3082.66s)]
*  We'll get the bad news. We'll get the bad news out of the way first and then we get to the good news. Yeah. Yeah [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3086.02s)]
*  And it's it's so it's it's a bummer because he loses but I think that it's also [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3092.26s)]
*  There's this silver lining there and that it's so close 52 to 48 [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3097.06s)]
*  And probably he would have lost if he didn't have all the like levers of the state to pull with like manipulating state media and stuff [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3101.14s)]
*  Like that. So I think it's a it's a nice reminder that [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3106.98s)]
*  Even when it seems like someone has been in office for so long one of these, you know generation of elected strong men [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3110.7400000000002s)]
*  Around the world that we're seeing now like trump obviously one of the examples of this [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3117.3s)]
*  There's it's still not too late [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3123.14s)]
*  Even if it's been forever, they really dug in they really become an authoritarian [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3124.7400000000002s)]
*  It's still possible to at least get really close and I think could have happened at least theoretically in turkey [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3128.5s)]
*  I think the other side of that [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3133.06s)]
*  Election was argentina in october where? [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3135.7799999999997s)]
*  The the crazy right-wing populist like the new guy on the scene who is part of this wave of the like [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3139.46s)]
*  Anti-establishment populist right wins out of nowhere. I was out wolverine [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3145.52s)]
*  That's right don't defamation me [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3153.8599999999997s)]
*  I don't know if he believes in laws. So I don't know if he could sue you for defamation. Anyway, yeah [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3156.58s)]
*  Um, and I think that's just like [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3161.14s)]
*  it's seeing those two together was striking because it's a reminder that the like [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3163.86s)]
*  Decrepit old ben and office forever version of this is still with us. But also countries are still electing these guys [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3168.02s)]
*  Um, even if it is like I don't think melee is going to be urdu one. He's not that bad [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3174.2599999999998s)]
*  and also he's not that competent but [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3179.06s)]
*  There's still a lot of like disaffected youth vote like disaffected economic vote that people are still picking these people [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3181.7s)]
*  um, but then the two others that I think of is kind of really interesting as a pair is [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3188.1800000000003s)]
*  Poland, of course your favorite in mind and the netherlands which are actually like more [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3193.1400000000003s)]
*  Similar than they look so poland in october [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3198.1800000000003s)]
*  The law and justice party which has been in office for like eight years now, I think [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3201.7000000000003s)]
*  um [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3206.34s)]
*  Again similar to turkey where all the opposition parties come together [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3207.1400000000003s)]
*  So we have to get rid of these guys because they become increasingly authoritarian and law and justice does come in [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3209.78s)]
*  First of the parties, but they can't form a government so because all these other parties are banded together [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3214.7400000000002s)]
*  So just I think today they just like swore in the new government or it was like a confidence vote [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3219.86s)]
*  um, and then the netherlands [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3225.6200000000003s)]
*  Is not that different like law and justice got 35 percent in poland and the netherlands the far right gert wilders is party for freedom [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3228.1000000000004s)]
*  124 percent of the vote and again like was the most popular party [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3236.88s)]
*  But it looks like maybe we'll not have enough to form a coalition [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3241.7799999999997s)]
*  so I think it's like looking at those two as a reminder that number one like [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3244.5s)]
*  Still kind of around the world like between a quarter and a third of voters are voting for the far right and we're saying that [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3248.58s)]
*  In country over country like are you seeing it in the united states? [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3254.02s)]
*  Yeah, because it's like about the size of trump space [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3256.8999999999996s)]
*  And then it's just a question of like what does the political system do with that? [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3259.3799999999997s)]
*  We're in poland all the parties came together and got rid of them, you know in the united states [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3262.98s)]
*  We see like the republican party coalesce around them [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3267.46s)]
*  So he wins office and then in netherlands where it's still [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3269.62s)]
*  We're still a long way out from them forming a governing coalition [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3273.38s)]
*  The question is going to be are the other party is going to come together to keep gert wilders out of office [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3275.78s)]
*  Are they're going to follow the moderate republican temptation and join with them? [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3281.46s)]
*  Yeah, so you got kind of like we got dusty old autocrats hanging on for dear life, right? You got radical [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3286.02s)]
*  entirely new candidates and parties who sometimes look like wolverines [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3292.32s)]
*  And then you've got right-wing populists demagoguing immigration in the netherlands [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3296.6s)]
*  Islam, right, right. So there's kind of our trends. Yeah, right and versions of the gert wilders thing and like every country [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3301.72s)]
*  Yeah, so that's including here. Yeah [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3308.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, i've i've heard about that. Yeah [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3310.7599999999998s)]
*  um, so [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3313.88s)]
*  2024 [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3316.02s)]
*  Everyone is calling it the biggest election year in history [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3317.64s)]
*  It's a little silly because the population gets bigger every year [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3319.8s)]
*  So probably like every third year is the biggest election year in history. Well, that's a good point, but sorry [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3322.52s)]
*  Oh, that is a good point [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3327.88s)]
*  Bill ben was mocking me earlier for saying it because so there's not all that contested, you know [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3329.32s)]
*  Including india which is counts for the biggest population share but you know, um [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3335.96s)]
*  Uh any year that india in the us and indonesia, right? I'll have elections. It's gonna be the biggest [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3340.52s)]
*  Well, it's I so it is it is a lot [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3345.64s)]
*  It's out of the the 10 largest countries in the world by population eight are having elections all of them except for nigeria [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3348.04s)]
*  And I was surprised by this china not holding elections next year, which I was I thought was unusual [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3354.36s)]
*  Yeah, much being off here for them [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3359.2400000000002s)]
*  Uh, but it is 70 countries having national elections, which is a lot [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3362.44s)]
*  Over half of the world's population lives in a country that will have a national election [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3368.2s)]
*  Um, and 41 percent of the world population next year will have votes to select their national leader [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3372.44s)]
*  Although as you said varying degrees of freedom russia is not going to be that close [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3379.32s)]
*  No, but I think still an interesting contest like presidential elections in authoritarian states like russia [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3384.52s)]
*  We know what the result is going to be but we have seen that like [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3391.48s)]
*  How that plays out can tell us a lot about politics in russia [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3395.0s)]
*  Of course like the 2012 election which putin, you know [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3398.2799999999997s)]
*  Also stole ended up being a really big moment in russian politics [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3401.64s)]
*  I think they're like the even the authoritarian elections. Yeah, I next year I think are going to be really important like [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3405.96s)]
*  Russia, um, I think belarus maybe has one and just seeing like do people turn out do they not turn out what you know? [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3412.2799999999997s)]
*  What does the opposition do? How real does it look? I think will tell us a it's like real test for these leaders [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3418.68s)]
*  um, and I kind of think that [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3424.12s)]
*  Like autocracy versus democracy is a really big theme this coming year [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3426.92s)]
*  I mean in the united states and india, obviously this feels like a really big make or break moment for you know, [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3431.48s)]
*  popular authoritarianism [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3438.02s)]
*  The india election unfortunately does not look close. It's going to be over april and may and the polls are just you know [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3441.0s)]
*  The bjp is going to run away with it. Yeah, it looks like but it does look like they're going to do really poorly in a lot [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3447.48s)]
*  of the southern states [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3452.04s)]
*  Which has been the big trend for them for a while as they're losing a lot of state offices down there and that [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3453.8s)]
*  Is not enough to swing the elections for them [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3458.6800000000003s)]
*  But I think does say something about like politics and india changing. Yeah. Well, I I think you know the [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3460.36s)]
*  The question about i've about modi is we've seen him move, you know further to the right [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3467.0s)]
*  pretty steadily with time [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3473.0800000000004s)]
*  Um, and if he is validated and with a pretty significant electoral victory [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3474.92s)]
*  like at a certain point [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3480.6000000000004s)]
*  Does does he start to kind of really structurally try to change? [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3482.68s)]
*  I mean he already has to you know [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3486.7599999999998s)]
*  There are ways we can look at the metrics of what he's done to kind of consolidate control over the media and intimidate journalists [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3488.2799999999997s)]
*  And so he's run pieces of the authoritarian playbook [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3493.96s)]
*  But there is kind of a world in which it's almost like we are now a one-party state with the leader, you know [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3496.6s)]
*  um, and and to me the u.s election [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3502.8399999999997s)]
*  Which we you know, we but if if trump wins and modi [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3505.64s)]
*  Then we're kind of in this world of like [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3510.44s)]
*  trump modi she [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3513.56s)]
*  Putin [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3515.8s)]
*  You know, it's kind of on you know [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3516.84s)]
*  That that's a kind of scary thing to think about [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3520.12s)]
*  Yeah, the idea of there being this kind of axis of right-wing authorities, which you know, we saw [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3522.52s)]
*  We had a little window of that in in 2018 2019 when bolsonaro was elected [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3528.6s)]
*  Yeah, and they're kind of buddying up with netanyahu, too. Yeah [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3533.72s)]
*  Um [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3536.6s)]
*  I mean modi is what what is what he what is he going to do after this election? [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3537.8s)]
*  I think is a really it's an important question. He already has an outright majority. Yeah in the legislature, which is unusual and [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3542.36s)]
*  Like we've seen in so many countries all the opposition parties are banding together to try to beat him [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3549.7200000000003s)]
*  And it looks like they're not even gonna get close looks like he's actually gonna gain seats probably and um, there was a recent poll [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3553.88s)]
*  Uh, I think it was by morning consulted a bunch of different countries that found that he has the highest [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3560.84s)]
*  Approval or favorability rating of any world leader that they tested like plus 60. Yeah [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3566.18s)]
*  so [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3572.52s)]
*  That's a a mandate for him to do more of what he has been doing which is bad at the same time [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3573.96s)]
*  I feel like the worst authoritarianism comes when leaders feel besieged, right? [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3578.76s)]
*  It's like when urduwan gets really close to losing or when orbong gets really close to losing [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3582.92s)]
*  It's when those guys get really scary. Yeah, or when pudin saw [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3587.32s)]
*  In the 2011 parliamentary elections a huge popular right uh uprising against him and right, you know, right [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3590.76s)]
*  Then that's when it was kind of on with a bit of a turn, right? Yeah [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3596.52s)]
*  I mean there are a few elections like to feel hopeful about next year that I think are going to be real tests for [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3600.68s)]
*  Honestly tests for authoritarianism as much as they are for democracy like this deal to have elections [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3607.7200000000003s)]
*  In venezuela, which I know they haven't set a date for yet if that happens. I mean [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3613.0s)]
*  Obviously, i'm very hopeful that maduro would lose but that's one of a few elections also in tinesia also in pakistan where like [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3618.2000000000003s)]
*  Autocracy is kind of on the ballot and voters will hope have [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3624.34s)]
*  Some degree of a real chance. It's not clear how real it's going to be to [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3628.6000000000004s)]
*  Express real support for democracy and to really help bring it about. Yeah [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3632.76s)]
*  Yeah, and and you know risk though for it to go [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3637.0800000000004s)]
*  You know in the direction of violence or intimidation [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3641.0800000000004s)]
*  But you'd love to see you know a positive surprise at any any one of those [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3644.54s)]
*  you know, it's it's it's not the odds unfavorite, but [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3649.8199999999997s)]
*  You know a turn in one of those places would be huge [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3653.9799999999996s)]
*  Right. Yeah [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3656.7799999999997s)]
*  I mean both to see a change in leadership and also to see you know voters have a window to make a country more democratic [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3657.5s)]
*  Which is something that used to happen all the time in the world, but we have not seen so much of in the last [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3663.8999999999996s)]
*  Venezuela idea in particular, you know the challenge of venezuela is some people left, you know [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3668.54s)]
*  um, so the question is like [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3672.7799999999997s)]
*  Have some of the people that would be the most inclined to oppose maduro left the country, right? [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3676.2999999999997s)]
*  But we'll see right and so many candidates have been disqualified [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3680.94s)]
*  it was this big question now about whether the u.s will still sign off on the election and [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3683.9s)]
*  It's also a question of whether ukraine will hold an election constitutionally. They're supposed to in march [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3689.1s)]
*  It seems like almost certainly they will not and I get why and I think they have good reasons [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3693.8199999999997s)]
*  but i'm sure that will be something that [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3698.54s)]
*  You know the usual suspects will use to accuse zelensky of being a dictator [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3701.18s)]
*  Yeah, I see why I also think politics is gonna is already kind of returning a bit to ukraine [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3704.94s)]
*  You're seeing some cracks. You're seeing some dissent. You're seeing some complaints and [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3709.74s)]
*  I mean that's to be expected and healthy but holding an election with [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3714.46s)]
*  This many people on the front line this many people [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3719.02s)]
*  Out of the country and frankly just not being a safe environment in parts of ukraine to come out in mass [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3722.86s)]
*  I mean talk about creating a target for russian strikes, you know [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3728.54s)]
*  so [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3732.2200000000003s)]
*  But I I do think the return of politics ukraine is something to watch. Yeah, that's a good point and I know that [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3733.42s)]
*  All of the ukrainian political parties came together [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3739.7400000000002s)]
*  I think a few months ago and said we agree. We don't want to have elections next year [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3742.62s)]
*  We're not we you know, we don't want to contest anything [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3746.2200000000003s)]
*  But if you start to see rumblings about that or you know, when are we going to start thinking about holding elections? [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3748.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I think it will be interesting to watch are there any big elections you guys [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3753.42s)]
*  So the some predictor the taiwan, um, you know, so taiwan votes early next year. There's three candidates [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3757.34s)]
*  the the the [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3764.1400000000003s)]
*  Current party in power the dpp sighing when the president's term limited out [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3766.1400000000003s)]
*  The guy who's running to replace her was the vice president william. Lai has generally been seen as more kind of pro-independence [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3770.7000000000003s)]
*  Right. He's moderated that he's trying to say the right things [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3776.6200000000003s)]
*  The two opposition parties both kind of to some extent favor better ties with china [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3779.9s)]
*  So if william lai wins [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3785.1s)]
*  This kind of window opens up where I think you know the the risk of china [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3787.58s)]
*  Doing something [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3792.62s)]
*  Exists, you know, um if one of these opposition parties that favors closer ties to mainland china [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3794.14s)]
*  wins [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3800.86s)]
*  You know, then maybe tensions go down a little bit [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3802.54s)]
*  But I I still think that no taiwanese political party is going to be able to like make the kinds of deals [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3804.62s)]
*  That were contemplating the past essentially one country two systems, but that's worth watching and then indonesia [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3810.22s)]
*  Um, you know, it's it's just a huge important country [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3816.14s)]
*  With the very popular. I mean jacobi the outgoing president is one of the more popular leaders in the world [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3820.22s)]
*  You know, he he he's got a guy [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3825.66s)]
*  An ex-general who ran against him twice and refused to accept the results. The election is kind of narrowly leading in the polls [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3828.22s)]
*  The person running against that ex-general selected jacobi's son as his running mate [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3834.7s)]
*  And they had to make an I think an adjustment in the rules to let that happen [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3839.74s)]
*  And so on the one hand, I think this is probably the better candidate for indonesian democracy on the other hand it suggests a kind of [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3843.8199999999997s)]
*  dynastic politics which indonesia has always had [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3849.66s)]
*  And even jacobi was kind of a beneficiary. Yeah of that. Yeah one wild card out there guys is israel [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3852.7s)]
*  I was gonna say that's one election. I would love to see it. It'd be great to see that happen. Yeah, yeah [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3859.42s)]
*  I am also gonna have my eyes on the [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3865.42s)]
*  Election in mexico, which is in june in june. Yes [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3867.5s)]
*  And it looks like the moreno incumbent is going to win which I think is kind of [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3872.7000000000003s)]
*  I don't know. Yeah, the leftist the you know progressive established or anti-establishment outsider [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3878.38s)]
*  I just feel like the story of mexican democracy is one that we kind of don't pause to appreciate enough [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3884.54s)]
*  I mean, this is a country that was a dictatorship [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3889.02s)]
*  23 years ago and now the two opposition parties that were opposed to the [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3891.1800000000003s)]
*  pro-dictatorship party are in the lead and they're the two [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3897.66s)]
*  Parties that are running to dispute the election this progressive outsider party that was nowhere 10 years ago [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3901.82s)]
*  Now looks like they have kind of a lock on polls. You know, i've been kind of disappointed by lo preserbedor the incumbent who's um [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3907.42s)]
*  Someone from his party is running but you know, they're a real progressive outsider party [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3914.94s)]
*  They've done well [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3920.14s)]
*  And I just I don't know [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3920.86s)]
*  I think it's worth appreciating that there looks like they're gonna have a another really nice election and they'll have their first woman president [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3921.98s)]
*  Yeah, claudia schoenbaum seems very likely to win right? Yeah, they'll beat us to that too. Yeah [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3927.1s)]
*  Um, okay. Well, it's some good ones. I like that [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3933.2599999999998s)]

*  Things can get better and they are in a lot of countries. They are it's it's incremental. It's bit by bit, but it's happening. Excellent [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3940.86s)]

*  I think it's worth remembering. I always tried to remember this at newspapers is that bad things happen fast and good things happen slowly [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3978.38s)]
*  So we don't appreciate the good things and like a country like mexico getting more democratic [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOs9y6oV2vc&t=3984.3s)]
