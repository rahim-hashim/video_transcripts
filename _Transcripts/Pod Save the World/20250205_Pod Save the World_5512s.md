Video Description: Tommy Vietor and Ben Rhodes discuss the assault on USAID by Trump and Elon Musk, how Democrats can best make the argument to support it, and why putting it under the purview of the State Department is a bad idea. They also discuss a purge at the FBI, Marco Rubio’s first overseas trip as Secretary of State, the moral and logistical stupidity of both sending US prisoners to El Salvador and undocumented migrants to Guantanamo Bay, Trump launching air strikes in Somalia, and Netanyahu’s meeting with Trump at the White House.

# Donald Trump Adds Gaza to List of Territories He Wants U.S. Control Over
**Pod Save the World:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw)
*  Welcome back to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Ben Rhodes [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=0.0s)]
*  Just when I thought I couldn't be less excited about this Super Bowl [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3.18s)]
*  We find out that Trump's doing the interview that Biden skipped twice and now he's going to the Super Bowl in New Orleans [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5.88s)]
*  I know I know I guess we get Kendrick Lamar. That's true. I mean Trump's not like us. I [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=11.92s)]
*  Wonder if Kendrick will do or say anything at half time. Probably not probably not nobody, you know, nobody cares [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=17.8s)]
*  Kendrick used to be very focused on politics now [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=24.96s)]
*  Remember when Kendrick came to the old? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=27.82s)]
*  I do I do remember that Obama Obama huge Kendrick Lamar. Yeah, those albums were great still great Grammy winner now [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=29.82s)]
*  Ben I thought we were gonna lead the show today with a brand spanking new trade war with Canada and Mexico [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=36.34s)]
*  But it seems like all the threats over the weekend from Trump to slap [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=42.66s)]
*  25% tariffs on these countries were bluster and the Canadians and the Mexicans just found a way to offer up some fake [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=46.9s)]
*  Concessions or like repackaged things they'd already done or said they would do to I guess buy another month of [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=53.54s)]
*  negotiations, but uh [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=60.5s)]
*  Bummer man. We were promised to trade where we got we got a fentanyl czar in Canada [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=62.58s)]
*  Yeah, it's like having some extra gifts, you know somewhere under the bed or in the garage that you just you realize you forgot a [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=67.14s)]
*  Birthday or something you just take a matter. Let's see. I did get you something. I got you a book my book [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=76.54s)]
*  I got you a fentanyl czar, you know, you read after the fall [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=80.14s)]
*  But I mean it is just the absurdity of [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=84.53999999999999s)]
*  These being wholly designed for American news cycles and right the world that we actually live in Shane Baum seems to [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=88.1s)]
*  Understand to that she can kick the shit out of Trump and yeah in her own [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=96.06s)]
*  Media in her own language and I guess they're not speaking Spanish in the White House because then you know [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=100.25999999999999s)]
*  He praises her every time he talks better [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=105.34s)]
*  She may be setting an example for how you deal with things. Yeah, she's smart. She's fighting back punch it back [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=107.42s)]
*  I don't think the Justin Trudeau flight of Mar-a-Lago [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=112.3s)]
*  Get slapped around and called the 51st state approach was as effective. I did like their red state focused [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=115.18s)]
*  That was my so that was smart and they're gonna tear up a bunch of like, you know, Kentucky whiskey [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=122.82000000000001s)]
*  Yeah things that come from red states. It wasn't just enjoyable to me. I actually thought that was a smart strategy [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=127.5s)]
*  So the people are adjusting this but I mean look the trade war will be back [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=132.5s)]
*  I mean, I think what we've learned is it [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=135.76s)]
*  Anything any other country does it he doesn't like [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=138.16s)]
*  He's just gonna threaten terrorists and we're just gonna live with that. Yeah, he's got like one card in the deck [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  It is frustrating though because you as we just discussed Trump got nothing really substantively [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=146.2s)]
*  No shame mom said she'd send some more troops to the border. They're already there. It's not do that [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=150.72s)]
*  Troops will like do fentanyl checks. Anyway, it's hard to detect. It's compact [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=154.68s)]
*  Yeah, the Canadians named the fentanyls are I think I read that like 70 pounds of fentanyl was seized [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=160.16s)]
*  At the northern border over three years as opposed to 70,000 at the southern border. So it's just not really the issue up there [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=165.76s)]
*  It's literally a weight that I could carry. Yeah, and I really like a rucksack [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=171.72s)]
*  That's not exactly a national security crisis now [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=175.16s)]
*  But Trump did decide to impose 10% tariffs on Chinese exports to the US. Yes, China announced some retaliatory tariffs [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=178.07999999999998s)]
*  American coal and LNG is gonna get hit with like 15% tariffs 10% on some other stuff like crude oil and ag [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=185.32s)]
*  machinery [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=191.92s)]
*  China will take some other things. I think [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=192.95999999999998s)]
*  That way I guess we'll see what happens there and also [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=195.16s)]
*  Everyone in Europe is wondering whether tariffs on the EU are next. So stay tuned [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=198.76000000000002s)]
*  It seems to be I mean he was threatening it. I mean, I think that the main thing we're gonna watch is while American [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=204.52s)]
*  consumers of political news live in 24-hour cycles [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=212.12s)]
*  The four-year cycle is gonna be one in which the entire world [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  Re-oriented systems of trade and economics away from the United States as if we're like the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=219.06s)]
*  insane drunk in the corner of the party and nobody wants to necessarily go up and fight that person but [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=224.66s)]
*  They definitely move to the other side of the room [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=229.5s)]
*  Yeah [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=231.42000000000002s)]
*  Chinese think that they can just stand on the other side of the room and have people come to them [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=231.74s)]
*  I mean, they're probably right about that. They're probably right that I've ever been that drunk guy in the room [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=235.34s)]
*  Yes [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=241.74s)]
*  I have but I've never threatened tariffs while I was drunk [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=243.98000000000002s)]
*  He's [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=246.66s)]
*  Maybe you start. Yeah, so terrifying people. Okay. Well, we have a way [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=247.82s)]
*  This is a good point to re-air my theory that [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=251.42s)]
*  Presidents who don't drink any alcohol are weird seem to be weird. You know, George Bush started a war. Mm-hmm Joe Biden [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=254.22s)]
*  Ran for reelection [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=262.46s)]
*  You know, maybe it's okay to have a glass of wine when your president have a drink get a dog [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=263.94s)]
*  Yeah, it's only gonna help you. We have a very Trump heavy show today. We're not happy about it [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=268.74s)]
*  It's not what it is people it is what it is [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=273.22s)]
*  Yeah, there's some really big important stuff happening in US foreign policy that is gonna impact the world that we're gonna dig into [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=275.54s)]
*  We're gonna start with Trump's attempt to use Elon Musk and the Doge nerds [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=280.78000000000003s)]
*  To shut down the US Agency for International Development or USAID [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=285.90000000000003s)]
*  We're gonna look at the purge happening in the FBI nothing ominous about that Ben [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=290.22s)]
*  Then we'll cover Secretary of State Marco Rubio's first trip to Latin America [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=294.42s)]
*  Any truly awful idea that emerged from his time in El Salvador will also explained why Gitmo's back in the news [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=299.46000000000004s)]
*  We'll tell you about a surprising choice to lead State Department's public diplomacy efforts [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=305.5s)]
*  And then finally Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu is in DC today. He is meeting with Trump in a few minutes [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=309.7s)]
*  We're recording the first half of this show before that meeting happens so we can for timing reasons [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=316.22s)]
*  But we'll cover whatever comes out of it after the show including there's some [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=321.58000000000004s)]
*  Trump just signed an executive order going back to his old Iran strategy of maximum pressure so [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=326.15999999999997s)]
*  Great. Yeah, that'll solve it. Yeah, and then then you did our interview today. Who do you talk to? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=333.48s)]

*  Delivering firewood for instance to the brave Ukrainian defenders on the Eastern Front [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=535.96s)]
*  But let's not pull any punches about why this is happening [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=547.6800000000001s)]
*  Elon Musk makes billions of dollars based off of his business with China and [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=552.52s)]
*  China is cheering at this action today [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=559.6800000000001s)]
*  Murphy later stormed the USA ID building and took it a dump on the assistant administrators desk. That's a joke [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=563.82s)]
*  I do like that Murphy's trying to find the why here kind of create an enemy [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=569.86s)]
*  I do think that's important [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=573.3000000000001s)]
*  You know, we'll see so Ben a bunch of USA ID staffers were told not to come to the office in DC [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=574.6600000000001s)]
*  Their emails were frozen all over the world [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=579.5600000000001s)]
*  And then Elon Musk, of course Ben took to Twitter to start attacking USA ID as a criminal organization [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=581.5600000000001s)]
*  I think he said it was run by radical Marxists Trump got in on the fun [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=588.32s)]
*  He said the USA ID was run by radical lunatics a little twist on the [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=592.42s)]
*  on the unfair allegations and then Elon's staff I guess tried to storm into a [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=597.8199999999999s)]
*  Secure facility and access classified information without a clearance. So this is a mess for those unfamiliar with USA ID [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=602.62s)]
*  It's an independent agency that was first set up in 1961 [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=609.06s)]
*  Under the Kennedy administration and has become a critical source of global humanitarian funding that ranges from disaster assistance to global health programs [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=612.26s)]
*  Like HIV AIDS treatment or monitoring and responding to disease outbreaks like Ebola or the bird flu like very important stuff in [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=620.86s)]
*  2023 USA ID managed about 40 billion dollars that was appropriated by Congress for programs in 130 countries [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=628.5s)]
*  That is a lot of money [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=634.9s)]
*  But less than 1% of the federal budget and it tends to be well under the point seven percent of gross national [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=635.86s)]
*  Production target that a lot of wealthy countries use for their international assistance target [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=642.2199999999999s)]
*  So the Post Washington Post said the top recipients of USA ID funding include Ukraine, Ethiopia, Jordan the Democratic Republic of Congo in Somalia [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=646.76s)]
*  And just for what it's worth [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=654.88s)]
*  This attempt to unilaterally close or fold USA ID into state is illegal because it's an independent agency and you can't do that [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=656.8000000000001s)]
*  Congress would have to Senator Brian shots of Hawaii's announced [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=663.84s)]
*  He's gonna put a blanket hold on all of Trump's State Department nominees until this attack on USA ID ends which could take a while [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=666.36s)]
*  So Ben, why don't we just pause there? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=672.96s)]
*  Like can you just talk about in your opinion eight years working in new administration with the value of USA ID was [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=675.48s)]
*  Both I know in terms of the development assistance in these programs [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=681.6800000000001s)]
*  But also the value to US national security and our ability to advance US interests or values abroad [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=685.08s)]
*  Yeah, I mean we talked about this a bit last week [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=692.64s)]
*  So I don't want to cover exactly the same ground the the the short version is [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=694.72s)]
*  USA ID those countries point to what their priorities are they overlap [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=699.32s)]
*  Significantly with American national security interests, you know, they're in Ukraine [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=704.56s)]
*  Buttressing the Ukrainian state they're in Somalia as part of the counter al-shabaab strategy a terrorist organization that had aspirations to strike in the [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=709.0s)]
*  United States [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=717.5999999999999s)]
*  You know [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=718.0799999999999s)]
*  They've been in Iraq and Syria as part of the counter-isis mission if you don't want Ebola to come to the United States [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=718.3199999999999s)]
*  I do not know you need USA ID person on the ground [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=723.4799999999999s)]
*  Helping create clinics and supporting health care workers to stop epidemics before they get here [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=726.8399999999999s)]
*  All these things are true in the way that Chris Murphy framed them are absolutely true [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=732.16s)]
*  And if we withdraw from that business, we will be more endangered by terrorists and by disease. We will certainly [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=737.28s)]
*  basically allow China to kind of run the [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=744.96s)]
*  International finance and development aspects of the world order. They've been building that [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=748.6s)]
*  Preparing for this moment for some time with a parallel an alternative set of institutions including the Belt Road Initiative [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=754.12s)]
*  Which we've talked about a bit which is entirely a development focused initiative of bringing Chinese infrastructure and kind of tying the world into [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=760.3s)]
*  supply chains [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=767.78s)]
*  That run to Beijing. So, you know on its face [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=769.2199999999999s)]
*  It's stupid because it disadvantages the United States and not being in those places and addressing those issues. I think more [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=773.4599999999999s)]
*  Profoundly though. I've been thinking about this Tommy [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=781.74s)]
*  It almost depresses me that we have to give the kind of speeches that Chris Murphy gave or [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=784.3000000000001s)]
*  That you know, I've said on this podcast in other places about why you should care. We should care because we should care [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=790.46s)]
*  We should care because we should give a shit that this is the institution that helps and famines or that goes to places where there's a genocide [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=797.1800000000001s)]
*  There's something wrong with our country that we even think that we have to kind of go [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=805.58s)]
*  Tell people, you know [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=810.98s)]
*  Here's why this helps fight terrorism. I mean, I get what we should we have to become the kind of country that [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=812.98s)]
*  Wouldn't necessarily even need to kind of make these kind of bank shot arguments [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=820.7s)]
*  but that is also in our national interest because the rest of the world is looking at us and saying those people clearly don't give a shit and [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=826.14s)]
*  Everything we've ever said that we were taught as kids about [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=834.38s)]
*  America standing for certain things in the world the whole moral high ground in America tries to claim in every single dispute in the world with a [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=837.86s)]
*  Russia or China goes out the door when you've got a bunch of fucking gamer in cell [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=843.66s)]
*  20 year old doge dudes like marauding through the headquarters of the USA ID in the Ronald Reagan [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=850.58s)]
*  Federal Building in Washington DC that the rest of the world looks at us and thinks this has now become a country of [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=857.42s)]
*  Kids who didn't have friends in high school and they're gonna just take it out on the rest of the world and and that to me [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=864.98s)]
*  There's something more fundamental, you know, you kind of cover what's happening on the surface of Trump [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=871.42s)]
*  What does it mean about us as a country that this is just something that is happening in this country? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=876.22s)]
*  And I think the rest of the world is gonna look at that and they're gonna draw their own conclusions and their own conclusions [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=881.34s)]
*  They're not gonna be like yes, you know doge intern like [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=887.14s)]
*  I know I'm torn here, too [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=890.5s)]
*  Look the half of my brain is the guy who does this show on Tuesday and who's read the long ProPublica piece about USA ID cuts in [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=892.5s)]
*  Sudan and [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=899.94s)]
*  development workers who are having to decide whether to do what they were told by the US government and let babies die or [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=901.94s)]
*  Lose their jobs and keep treating those babies for as long as they can and I think that is a very important thing [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=908.98s)]
*  I think that is a very important thing [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=913.14s)]
*  Let babies die or [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=915.14s)]
*  lose their jobs and keep treating those babies for as long as they can and I think that is like profound and important and the [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=917.14s)]
*  Kind of story that will actually move people and the other half of my brain does positive America on Monday [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=922.26s)]
*  You can read a bunch of polling and knows it Americans think Dan Fiverr's in your ear [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=926.34s)]
*  2009 all over again and you and I are trying to get some comment in a speech and [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=932.64s)]
*  and knows that Americans don't want to send money overseas for programs or any little incidents of waste or fraud or abuse is gonna get [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=936.5s)]
*  Lifted up and amplified right like Republicans are already out there trying to suggest that you know, USA ID money went to either [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=944.58s)]
*  There are two kind of frames are either USA ID is responsible for kovat existing or that it just spawns like, you know [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=952.58s)]
*  Trans-operas in you know, various countries or whatever thing they think is sort of frivolous sounding [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=960.0200000000001s)]
*  And I'm like [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=964.82s)]
*  That's a literal that's like an actual thing [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=966.82s)]
*  Yeah, I'm pretty sure I can't wait for that's yeah [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=968.82s)]
*  The white house press secretary read it out and like I don't know what the truth is and it's so frustrating [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=971.22s)]
*  And I think this this stuff matters [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=975.86s)]
*  But I also like I also remember the day after the Haiti earthquake they sent in 2011 [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=977.9000000000001s)]
*  They sent me over to USA ID [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=983.0600000000001s)]
*  To kind of try to help manage things and it took 10 hours and we couldn't get email sent up for me and I had [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=984.5400000000001s)]
*  To come out so I know there's bureaucracy and things don't always work perfectly and it can be a mess [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=989.1s)]
*  But it's still important, you know, it's like a baby. Don't throw the baby with the bath water [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=993.3800000000001s)]
*  Situation and [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=997.3s)]
*  Figuring out how to fight this politically is hard [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=998.9s)]
*  I know I mean and look let me try to square this circle because you know [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1000.86s)]
*  You guys I'm sure are right on pots of America that if I were to ask for the first rally at the first government agency [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1004.62s)]
*  Shutdown by Elon Musk and Donald Trump [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1012.14s)]
*  You'd probably send people to the consumer financial protection bureau because that hits people's pocketbooks, right? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1015.14s)]
*  But I think you can do both at the same time [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1021.1s)]
*  Because I do think you can [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1023.54s)]
*  offer people values proposition that goes above the [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1025.86s)]
*  Transoperas and the you know, what Hamas condoms or whatever. Yep, that's just made up right? Yeah. Yeah [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1031.18s)]
*  To the point that it's interesting, you know, we've all kind of gone back and boned up on our society [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1036.7s)]
*  This was started in 1961. So I got it wrong. It was a DEI musical in Ireland [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1041.7s)]
*  Okay, there's some other thing confusing it with like, you know, this is that I'm sorry [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1046.22s)]
*  There was apparently it was a trans opera at Columbia [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1050.98s)]
*  Anyway, we have no idea if this is real but this is what the Republicans are saying [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1053.22s)]
*  But they want they want a small debate and maybe we should have a bigger debate [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1057.5s)]
*  You know [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1061.64s)]
*  they want the debate to be about very small things like these programs and [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1062.14s)]
*  We somehow think we win these debates when we prove that they're lying about the programs [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1065.46s)]
*  When there should be a bigger point about like what is this country and what does it stand for? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1069.58s)]
*  It's interesting to me that USAID was founded in 61. That was the height of the Kennedy [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1074.1000000000001s)]
*  That was John F Kennedy ask now what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1079.46s)]
*  We need to be in all these places. He started the Peace Corps and [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1084.78s)]
*  People were really proud, you know to be American at that time [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1088.8600000000001s)]
*  They felt better about being America when we were creating USAID [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1092.22s)]
*  Then I think people feel about America today that it's been destroyed, right? And so I think there's a way [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1097.02s)]
*  To try to to go above [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1102.38s)]
*  The certainly the DEI opera or musical or whatever it is [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1105.42s)]
*  But even above and again, I I love I think Chris Murphy's been the best Democrat since the Trump election [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1109.42s)]
*  But and I've said because I've said all the same shit [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1115.06s)]
*  He did to even go above that and just be like what kind of country are we? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1117.7s)]
*  You really want to be a country that doesn't care if there's a famine somewhere and does nothing about it [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1121.26s)]
*  And in your the short-term answer may be yes, but I think we have to change, you know [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1126.8600000000001s)]
*  If you don't make the argument, you know convince anyone [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1133.3s)]
*  Well, can I can I play for you a counterpoint then Marco Rubio did a press conference [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1135.1s)]
*  Where he actually blamed the aid groups for the confusion. Let's listen to that. I [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1139.02s)]
*  Enchated a blanket waiver that said if this is life-saving [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1144.22s)]
*  Programs, okay, if it's providing food or medicine or anything that is saving lives and is immediate and urgent [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1148.1s)]
*  You're not included in the freeze [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1153.6599999999999s)]
*  I don't know how much more clear we can be than that and I would say if some organization is [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1155.22s)]
*  Receiving funds from the United States and does not know how to apply a waiver [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1160.6599999999999s)]
*  Then I have real questions about the competence of that organization or I wonder whether they're deliberately sabotaging it for purposes of making a political point [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1164.8999999999999s)]
*  Take that [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1173.06s)]
*  nurse providing, you know [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1174.78s)]
*  ARVs to a child with HIV in in Sudan [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1177.22s)]
*  First of all, Marco showed you he's lying [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1181.86s)]
*  They did freeze life. I mean landmines we talked about right? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1184.6999999999998s)]
*  Freeze this aid then they walked it back then they change it again [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1188.62s)]
*  Like they've created mass confusion and also he doesn't even know he probably had no idea that this was happening with USAID [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1191.26s)]
*  He probably found out he was in charge of USAID in a press release, you know [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1197.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean that guy could not be further out of the loop [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1200.34s)]
*  You know, so I wouldn't surprise me if we're on this podcast if you're just talking about [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1204.34s)]
*  Marco losing his security or something, you know [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1208.5s)]
*  but but so I [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1211.78s)]
*  Mean there is it to focus on what people's grievances have been with USAID [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1214.1399999999999s)]
*  It's often been that there's some waste there because USAID does a lot of business with contractors [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1220.3799999999999s)]
*  And so there's like a delta between the amount of money that is allocated and the amount of money that reaches people [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1226.34s)]
*  That's it and there's overhead to yeah, there's over and Samantha Power, you know [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1231.56s)]
*  It's spent a lot of time trying to kind of narrow that gap that would be a worthy way of looking at this [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1234.86s)]
*  There's also it is a weird structure in the sense that you had the State Department then USAID created an independent agency then [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1239.4199999999998s)]
*  Republicans and mainly George Bush created PEPFAR [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1245.6999999999998s)]
*  State George Bush also created that Millennium Challenge accounts, which is this kind of separate entity that administers grants to countries, but look [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1249.6999999999998s)]
*  just [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1258.1399999999999s)]
*  You know part of what is happening here is Trump is trying to capture you want to talk about Marxism [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1259.34s)]
*  He's trying to capture the means of production for the government [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1263.3799999999999s)]
*  He's trying to capture all the money that the government controls [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1267.22s)]
*  So that it kind of is answerable only to him and not to Congress [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1271.74s)]
*  That's what this is really about the consolidation power and and that's I think what we have to keep our eye on [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1274.8200000000002s)]

*  I wanted to take this idea seriously to whether a USA ID should be merged with state or part of state [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1422.6200000000001s)]
*  And there's probably some people thinking well, why doesn't that make more sense? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1428.5s)]
*  I mean, why wouldn't that be more efficient development assistance is key to our diplomacy [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1431.0200000000002s)]
*  Coordinating better might entail being under the same roof [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1436.02s)]
*  You could probably save some money and the the counter argument to that to this pitch to sort of merge USA ID in state [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1439.6200000000001s)]
*  Is that it's just easier said than done and there's actually a precedent of this kind of merger that we can look at [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1446.7s)]
*  They did not go well, which was the merger of an agency called the US information agency [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1451.98s)]
*  Or us IA into the State Department in 1999. So us IA [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1457.0800000000002s)]
*  What and you have a lot of expertise with this then you should talk about your engagement [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1461.26s)]
*  Us IA was the leading [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1464.46s)]
*  Public diplomacy element in the US government throughout the Cold War [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1467.14s)]
*  they promoted some of the US values in economic system and it was apparently quite effective and [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1471.0600000000002s)]
*  The advocates for the merger of USIA into the State Department said it would save money improve coordination [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1476.94s)]
*  Make the agency more effective but years later [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1484.3000000000002s)]
*  I mean I read this report from the Heritage Foundation which supports [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1487.38s)]
*  Merging USA ID into state who said that this [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1491.24s)]
*  merger of USIA into the State Department was a disaster and the reason was you have this [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1495.8s)]
*  Agency that does public diplomacy that gets picked apart [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1501.72s)]
*  It gets put into different components of the State Department and it's never prioritized [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1504.0s)]
*  You got like kind of orphan elements all over state that includes and then you have State Department leaders [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1508.0s)]
*  Picking whether to fund public diplomacy or the stuff they actually care about and know how to do [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1514.28s)]
*  And obviously they're gonna choose, you know the thing that they're used to working on the you know [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1519.9599999999998s)]
*  Funding for the ambassador versus public diplomacy Monday. It downgraded the [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1525.08s)]
*  leadership of public diplomacy it it took away a clear agency's purpose and [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1530.32s)]
*  Kind of made it jammed it into the State Department and its culture [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1536.6399999999999s)]
*  Which is risk averse and slow and secretive and basically long story short [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1540.1999999999998s)]
*  hobbled this public diplomacy effort right before 9-eleven when we really could have used it so [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1544.7199999999998s)]
*  It's just it's not as simple as it looks. I'm like a McKinsey [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1549.6799999999998s)]
*  Or chart that's exactly right. You summarize the USA piece perfectly which is [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1553.1999999999998s)]
*  Public diplomacy and I tried on this for eight years, but it's just deep vastly deprioritized at state [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1558.1599999999999s)]
*  You don't get ahead in your career by becoming a public diplomacy officer at State Department [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1564.6s)]
*  There's always gonna be a crisis or a government to government relationship [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1571.08s)]
*  That is gonna command the attention of the Secretary of State and the senior leadership of the State Department [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1574.76s)]
*  more than some public diplomacy program [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1579.24s)]
*  So you basically kind of created a stepchild that was never prioritized and therefore [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1582.0s)]
*  Never did as well as anybody wanted and every now and then great programs emerged or you know [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1588.44s)]
*  Really innovative people emerged but nobody would argue that the mission of public diplomacy was improved by that [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1593.56s)]
*  consolidation and the same is true on USA ID and you know, though that's a different skill set the ability to administer a [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1599.52s)]
*  Foreign assistance program to surge resources into a conflict zone to surge health [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1607.44s)]
*  Resources into an epidemic zone that's different than an ambassador going into to negotiate a bilateral relationship [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1613.8000000000002s)]
*  Or learning, you know five languages to serve in Jordan [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1620.72s)]
*  Yeah, exactly, you know and and there's another piece of it which you know is is probably a harder political cell [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1624.16s)]
*  But it's what I would always hear from the USA ID people [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1630.7s)]
*  When the State Department shows up everybody thinks well, they're just showing up because you know [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1633.6000000000001s)]
*  There's some political interest behind what they're advocating [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1638.24s)]
*  Whereas USA ID is supposed to be these people that show up with a different mission. That's the brand we slap on stuff [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1640.68s)]
*  Yeah, we're here to give you food [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1647.5s)]
*  You know, we're here to end the famine where and yes that accrues to the Americas benefit in all the ways [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1650.16s)]
*  We talked about but it was meant to be seen as a you know, if the USA ID [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1655.88s)]
*  I don't know if we can say vaccines anymore now that RFK jr. Is on the path to confirmation [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1661.04s)]
*  But USA ID did a lot of polio vaccination around the world [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1665.1399999999999s)]
*  Which is saved untold lives and been good for us too because it's better to knock out these diseases [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1667.6399999999999s)]
*  If a State Department officer shows up to vaccinate you [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1672.6799999999998s)]
*  It's different than like a healthcare worker with a box that has USA ID on it, you know [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1676.36s)]
*  And none of this really matters to the Doge gang [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1681.1s)]
*  But but it will transform how people interact with the US government in lots of places [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1684.44s)]
*  Yeah, they don't care about this history. They don't care about the context. They just [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1688.52s)]
*  AI and at all. Yeah chat GBT in the government [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1691.76s)]
*  But USA ID is the only agency getting gutted here been there's lots of attorneys at DOJ [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1694.76s)]
*  At the Department of Justice who worked on prosecutions of Trump were being forced out [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1700.08s)]
*  and last week eight top executives at the FBI were fired and then over the weekend the [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1703.8799999999999s)]
*  FBI director told the acting FBI director told staff that the Trump administration is looking for the names of every single agent [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1709.72s)]
*  Who worked on the January 6th investigations and apparently thousands of FBI staffers were sent some sort of questionnaire or survey [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1716.16s)]
*  About their involvement in those investigations despite the fact that those agents don't get to choose what they work on [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1723.8400000000001s)]
*  They're just assigned things all of this is happening before Trump's FBI director nominee cash Patel has been confirmed [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1729.44s)]
*  And on Tuesday a group of nine FBI agents asked a federal judge to block these data collection efforts, but we'll see if that works [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1736.52s)]
*  It's hard to read this stuff and not feel like we're kind of sliding into the worst case [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1744.0s)]
*  Please nightmare. Yeah, I mean we're two weeks in here and [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1749.8s)]
*  Again, what are the most fundamental kind of if you strip government down to its essence? What is the fundamental power of government? [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1753.52s)]
*  It's the monopoly on violence [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1760.48s)]
*  That's the US military that's now led by Pete Hegseth [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1763.04s)]
*  It's a monopoly on justice and that's the FBI and the DOJ about to be led by cash Patel and Pam Bondi [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1766.16s)]
*  And that's spending money and we see you know, that's Elon Musk controlling all the payment system [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1772.96s)]
*  So this is a part of a very tried-and-true autocratic playbook to to seize and capture [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1777.76s)]
*  the most powerful organs of the state and use them for your own purposes and you know that [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1784.44s)]
*  It's not that unusual for a new president for instance to appoint new US attorneys [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1790.44s)]
*  But they're they're now FBI. These are cops, you know [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1796.0800000000002s)]
*  and [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1800.24s)]
*  There is it's not just that they're firing those people [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1801.44s)]
*  For things that those people probably get to choose what case they're assigned to [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1805.6000000000001s)]
*  It's a message that they're sending if you want to get ahead in your career. You have to be fully with the program [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1809.2s)]
*  So it's a deterrent effect [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1815.6200000000001s)]
*  It's a messaging effect as well as what it's done. And my question for you Tommy is like if this is what they do [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1817.8400000000001s)]
*  Before cash Patel gets you imagine. What do you think is coming when? [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1824.0800000000002s)]
*  When our guy cashes in there it's a little worrisome. Yeah may connect to our El Salvador conversation [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1828.44s)]
*  Yeah [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1834.52s)]
*  I mean boy imagine if some FBI agent is is listening in on a bad actor and picks up some information about a bribe [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1834.96s)]
*  Being given to a Trump administration person. Do they're gonna pursue that? That's exactly the point about the turn effect, right? [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1842.36s)]
*  Yeah, if you fired [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1848.12s)]
*  Everybody who is involved in any Trump investigation [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1849.96s)]
*  You're saying if if Elon Musk is like robbing a bank literally [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1852.8s)]
*  You probably you're not gonna be the guy to go arrest him because you know, that's the end of your career [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1858.2s)]
*  Look at doged good stuff for the lawyers like he's not currently robbing a bank. That's a hypothetical [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1862.72s)]
*  Yeah, hypothetically if he were to rob a bank via the new Treasury account access [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1868.8799999999999s)]
*  Maybe doesn't need a robbing Treasury that trillion dollar coin. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So in other parts of the government Rubio took his first overseas trip [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1875.0s)]
*  He went to Panama El Salvador Costa Rica Guatemala in the Dominican Republic [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1882.9199999999998s)]
*  Rubio's focus so far seems to be on immigration and then [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1887.84s)]
*  belligerent Woodrow Wilson era imperialism [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1893.12s)]
*  The first stop was Panama there Rubio repeated Trump's attacks about the Panama Canal Rubio's comments [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1895.56s)]
*  He was demanding quite quote immediate changes to push back on Chinese quote influence control over the Panama Canal [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1901.4199999999998s)]
*  That was covered as a threat by most Western media outlets correctly in my view [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1908.56s)]
*  But Panamanian president Jose Raul Molino just kind of brushed them off [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1913.3s)]
*  Saying he didn't view Rubio's comments as a threat and downplayed the concern about the US taking back control of the Panama Canal through some [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1917.5s)]
*  Sort of coercion [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1924.58s)]
*  I asked one of our smart Latin America expert friends about the kind of disparity between this obviously being a threat and the president [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1925.46s)]
*  Brushing it off and this person told me when Molino surrenders [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1932.66s)]
*  He wants it to look like it wasn't at the point of a gun [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1936.1000000000001s)]
*  So everyone's doing their politics here [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1938.1000000000001s)]
*  But for those who care about the facts Ben the Chinese do not control the Panama Canal [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1940.1s)]
*  It's administrated by a Panamanian entity called the Panama Canal Authority [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1944.02s)]
*  But there's two ports at each end of the canal that are run by a Hong Kong based company called CK [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1947.6999999999998s)]
*  Hutchinson Holdings and Rubio says Trump is worried that [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1952.56s)]
*  Those ports could block the flow of ships through the Panama Canal if the Chinese went hard in a trade war [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1956.06s)]
*  So that's the their stated thinking here [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1961.4399999999998s)]
*  Then Rubio went to El Salvador to meet with the self-described world's coolest dictator and Bitcoin enthusiast [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1964.68s)]
*  Naib Kalei their meeting focused on immigration as we discussed last week [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1971.88s)]
*  I think the El Salvador has been floated as a destination for Trump to send [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1975.92s)]
*  Migrants that he deports from the US especially Venezuelans [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1981.52s)]
*  But shit got weird when Bukele pitched a plan [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1984.3600000000001s)]
*  For the US to outsource part of our own prison system and send prisoners from the US including American citizens to El [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1989.0s)]
*  Salvador to be held in their mega prison industrial complex [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=1996.24s)]
*  Rubio called this offer [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2001.68s)]
*  Quote an act of extraordinary friendship and he said that quote no country has ever made an offer [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2003.88s)]
*  Friendship such as this maybe there's a reason for that Marco Ben [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2009.5200000000002s)]
*  I'd love to hear any thoughts you have on this Panama trip or [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2013.96s)]
*  Any other part of Rubio's mission you're overseas [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2017.44s)]
*  But I do think we should spend some time on this El Salvador prison offer because it is nuts [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2020.92s)]
*  But kick us off. Yeah, I want to start Panama because I saw the same thing which is that [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2025.6200000000001s)]
*  The rubio didn't say much in Panama himself and it was like some State Department spokesperson [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2031.64s)]
*  I think the State Department spokesperson who called him little Marco me [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2037.3200000000002s)]
*  Something [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2040.92s)]
*  Some say some State Department spokesmen issued the kind of threatening language and it reminded me [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2042.16s)]
*  I actually have interacted with Marco Rubio a number of times and [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2047.8600000000001s)]
*  most of those interactions took place after I [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2052.44s)]
*  Negotiated the cube opening that Marco Rubio absolutely hated right and I remember going to me within the first time and [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2055.6400000000003s)]
*  Having and thinking would be this horrible meeting and using yell at me or something and we had a very pleasant [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2063.0s)]
*  Conversation for a very long time. It was almost like an hour or something and [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2068.56s)]
*  He was a personal guy, you know, he asked, you know questions [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2072.52s)]
*  You know, he made clear he didn't agree but we were trying to find things that we could work together on [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2077.04s)]
*  And and then he goes out and absolutely blasts us, right? Of course, and and actually he called me and [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2082.2799999999997s)]
*  To give me a heads up when Trump did his first policy changes, which I thought was very nice [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2089.24s)]
*  I mean I was out of government [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2093.5s)]
*  and [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2095.52s)]
*  I actually but that was very nice. I thought it was I thought it was so nice that I said to him [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2096.48s)]
*  Hey, you know, like if you ever need me, you know, I obviously have relationships in Cuba [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2101.8s)]
*  If you ever if there's you we need to send a message [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2105.64s)]
*  Just you know [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2108.84s)]
*  I was just trying to think of something to say because he had this gesture and then that appeared in [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2109.44s)]
*  Like a free beacon or Breitbart story a couple hours later. The reason I'm telling these stories that Rhodes offers [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2114.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2121.0s)]
*  And it was making fun of me and stuff [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2121.64s)]
*  The reason I'm telling these stories is I would guess that Marco Rubio was not tough with the president Pena [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2123.2s)]
*  I would guess that he was very solicitous very nice that that meeting was very calm and [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2128.7599999999998s)]
*  Then they go out and then have like some press officer issued the threat [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2133.68s)]
*  That's this is the Marco Rubio that I would anticipate. I do not think that guy is tough in the room [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2138.56s)]
*  I think he's super tough when his plane takes off [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2143.64s)]
*  And you know that tells you all you need to know about just how much these guys are gonna stand up to dictators and stuff [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2146.96s)]
*  Like that or Trump. Yeah, and then the El Salvador thing we've covered bukele these prisons are you know [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2152.68s)]
*  Human rights organizations have reported [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2159.56s)]
*  Mass kind of indiscriminate detentions. There's been allegations of torture and disappearances [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2162.8s)]
*  he's basically set up this kind of gulag system to deal with security challenges, but also to kind of consolidate power and [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2169.0s)]
*  the idea [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2176.52s)]
*  That it's this I mean again only in 2025 as the world changed to the point that it's a positive to meet with a dictator and [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2178.2400000000002s)]
*  to then celebrate as a gesture of [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2186.64s)]
*  Magnificent magnanimity that the dictator will offer to [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2189.2000000000003s)]
*  imprison Americans [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2194.04s)]
*  In their so crazy destitute prisons. I mean, it's it's so crazy [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2196.04s)]
*  This is like a normal thing that would happen in 2025 [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2199.84s)]
*  but [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2202.56s)]
*  You know Marco Rubio used to criticize dictators, I guess not if they are the world's coolest of them [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2203.8s)]
*  Yeah earlier today, I thought they speak at CPAC right if you're the if you're a Bitcoin dictator with a backwards hat earlier today [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2209.96s)]
*  I talked to the guy named Noah Bullock who is the El Salvador executive director of a human rights organization called Christos all [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2217.2400000000002s)]
*  He know by the way was my next-door neighbor from when I was one until maybe four years old [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2225.5600000000004s)]
*  His sister was my best friend as a kid [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2230.7799999999997s)]
*  Their father was the Episcopal minister in our church and then he got reassigned and they moved to New York [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2233.62s)]
*  So I never saw them again, but it was like my literally best friend in this guy [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2238.7s)]
*  We're talking from El Salvador. It's crazy small. It's a small world [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2242.06s)]
*  Yes, but he was just he was telling me I mean I'd read about it [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2245.3399999999997s)]
*  But hearing him describe the scale of the mass incarceration operations in El Salvador really is unbelievable [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2247.9199999999996s)]
*  I mean [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2254.8599999999997s)]
*  I think roughly two percent of the total population of the country is currently in jail a [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2255.1s)]
*  Lot of them were imprisoned after Bukele declared what he called a state of exception [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2259.22s)]
*  Which meant he suspended a whole lot of constitutional rights. So in practice what you have as you mentioned is the mass roundup of young men [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2264.08s)]
*  Their show arrests for the cameras and they're thrown in jail without being charged for anything [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2272.1s)]
*  Maybe sometimes years at a time when they are charged. It's almost always for [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2277.06s)]
*  Association with a group not for an actual crime. You're just associated with a gang in some way [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2282.14s)]
*  You have no access to defense attorneys and it seems like what they think might come next is [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2287.98s)]
*  Mass trials of hundreds if not a thousand two thousand people at a time [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2293.9s)]
*  So on top of that as you mentioned there's systematic torture in these prisons. People are being to peer [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2298.2200000000003s)]
*  No one's talking about rehabilitation. You are in jail for life. So [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2302.94s)]
*  Like big picture Bukele is propping up this authoritarian state and like cult of personality [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2307.3s)]
*  Built on the back of this mass incarceration effort and [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2314.28s)]
*  He keeps arresting more and more people like setting another target of another ten thousand or twenty thousand and thirty thousand without letting anyone out [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2317.7000000000003s)]
*  So now he has to find a way to fund it. So yeah, the IMF is telling him you have to make all these cuts [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2323.76s)]
*  So he's cutting teachers. He's cutting hospital workers while expanding the military but running to the US and saying hey [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2329.64s)]
*  For some cash. I'll take some of your prisoners and just the idea of like [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2336.96s)]
*  Sending American citizens. I don't care what they did into a [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2343.08s)]
*  Transnational gulag to prop up this Bitcoin fucking dictator [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2347.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah is insane and I was asking him was like well isn't there like horrific violence within these prisons among the population [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2351.96s)]
*  And he said actually the only silver lining of this is there's relatively little violence [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2359.2000000000003s)]
*  But the reason is that they starve them so people are too tired to harm each other. It is like [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2363.96s)]
*  This could not be more fucked up and we will be subsidizing that prison system with the [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2369.68s)]
*  Quote-unquote fee that will be paying them to take people from this country including by the way potentially Americans [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2375.36s)]
*  Yeah, Trump has now floated that there will be sending Americans down to this transnational [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2381.36s)]
*  Trump was cool. They did a little presser the minute. It was like, oh, it's an interesting idea [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2385.62s)]
*  I mean again the rest of the world, you know, we may think that this is you know [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2388.56s)]
*  You're bored part of the Trump show but the rest of the world is gonna see America subsidizing and backing this kind of [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2393.46s)]
*  prison system [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2400.7400000000002s)]
*  And look, I just think [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2403.2200000000003s)]
*  It's also a warning [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2405.62s)]
*  Trump likes that system, right and [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2407.86s)]
*  We talked about the Lake and Riley bill [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2411.2200000000003s)]
*  Which a lot of Democrats voted for in which there's no due process [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2413.54s)]
*  And that's what you described that Buckeye does is rolling people up by associating them [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2417.46s)]
*  People up by association. That's kind of how Trump talks about anyone who's an immigrant in this country, you know [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2422.82s)]
*  And so you can see a slippery slope here to [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2428.5800000000004s)]
*  People suddenly losing due process to people suddenly finding them planes to prisons like that [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2432.82s)]
*  People who are undocumented and not Salvadorian who did nothing wrong [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2437.54s)]
*  Finding their way into one of bukele's prisons an american who maybe did do something wrong [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2442.1000000000004s)]
*  But we we didn't used to deport our own criminals other countries finding their way there [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2446.98s)]
*  Um, so you have to see this both as the kind of scary thing that it is [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2451.54s)]
*  But also even scarier as like indicative of the kind of system that trump likes, you know [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2456.2599999999998s)]
*  And and a root for a rubio who again? [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2461.54s)]
*  Came in onto the scene as one of these kind of mccain light human rights, you know defending [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2464.5s)]
*  hawks [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2471.86s)]
*  What a come down his first trip to you know as secretary of state he's going like el salvador and and in praising [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2473.46s)]
*  You know gulags and a lot of the rejoinder you hear to criticisms of bukele is that well [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2480.74s)]
*  He's the most popular leader in latin america and that is true [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2486.82s)]
*  But you have to talk about the context through which that popularity arises, which is he controls all the media. He dominates social media [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2490.5s)]
*  That like they've rounded up 86 000 people arbitrarily and everyone knows you could be next [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2498.2599999999998s)]
*  There's political prisoners. I mean, this is a lot like putin's russia [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2504.18s)]
*  And so you'll see you know bukele will have 80 approval in these polls [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2507.2200000000003s)]
*  But 65 of the population is afraid to talk about politics and those things are those things are connected [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2510.42s)]
*  Because no one there's no other political party like everyone is afraid afraid to express an opinion that could [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2516.98s)]
*  Lead to reprisal from the government and let's see where that popularity is in like five and ten years [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2522.82s)]
*  When a lot of people who've been put in prison wrongly have not been released [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2528.34s)]
*  When the corruption sets in and the economy people start to see the grift in it [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2532.58s)]
*  Um, there's a bit of a sugar high to you know rolling up every gang member [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2537.86s)]
*  10x innocent people and it just seems like crime is down [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2543.22s)]
*  And thinking well my you know brother or sister or cousin who got arrested [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2547.06s)]
*  Although surely they'll be out soon because there must have been some kind of mistake [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2551.7s)]
*  Well, they're not getting out and so I you know, I would expect that that popularity is not durable, but we'll see [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2555.46s)]
*  Yeah, and again, we're not trying to discount the importance of security [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2560.58s)]
*  I mean if your neighborhood went from filled with gangs on the streets people getting shot to relatively safe [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2564.34s)]
*  I'm sure you're genuinely grateful and happy about that [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2569.3s)]
*  The question is how did that come about was it was bukele cut a bunch of deals with these gangs? [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2571.54s)]
*  To kind of hide what they're doing because there's a lot of allegations that that's what happened and to your point [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2576.42s)]
*  I mean how this wears over five ten fifteen years when he's just locking more and more people up is a big question [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2580.26s)]
*  Um, but then speaking of transnational gulags, uh gitmo's back in the news [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2586.1000000000004s)]
*  Um, are the og transnational og? [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2589.86s)]
*  Maybe that was australia [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2593.62s)]
*  Maybe transnational. Okay [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2595.3s)]
*  Um trump wants to deport 30 000 migrants to gitmo [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2597.3s)]
*  Why not on tuesday the white house press secretary confirmed that the first deportation flights carrying about a dozen people to gitmo to keep [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2601.54s)]
*  What's on its way? [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2608.5s)]
*  Usually when we talk about gitmo we talk about the detention of post 9 11 prisoners [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2610.1800000000003s)]
*  Terrorism suspects and many who are tortured many who are wrongly detained [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2614.5s)]
*  But gitmo has also been used to temporarily detain asylum seekers picked up at sea including during the biden administration [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2618.2599999999998s)]
*  And there's a darker history there of caribbean migrants from haiti and cuba being held at gibbo in the 1990s [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2624.74s)]
*  This idea is nuts logistically. I mean for a million reasons [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2632.66s)]
*  It's nuts, uh, the new york times, you know had a long report on on this proposal and the logistics [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2636.4199999999996s)]
*  There's 15 prisoners currently at the guantanamo bay prison. They're being held in two buildings with about 275 cells [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2641.94s)]
*  There's not like a ton of infrastructure infrastructure existing infrastructure available, uh to house people pete hexaf the secretary of defense [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2649.38s)]
*  Suggested you could put tents up on the golf course to house another 6 000 deportees [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2657.28s)]
*  Um, there's a marine general quoted in this time story who said, uh in the 90s at its peak the camp held [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2663.2200000000003s)]
*  25 000 migrants mostly cubans. I think there's just people outside in tents [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2670.02s)]
*  But getting people to gitmo requires very expensive military flights and they have to ship in all the clothing all the food [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2673.86s)]
*  Water, I mean, it's like it's going to be unbelievably [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2681.78s)]
*  expensive logistically stupid and obviously gitmo is a [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2685.68s)]
*  moral stain on the history of our country, which [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2690.18s)]
*  Explains why trump probably likes the idea. Yeah, the doge bros could go down there to find some waste [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2693.22s)]
*  Because it's far more per prisoner to keep him open what I find interesting about this because you point out the absurdity of it [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2698.1s)]
*  So just to add another point [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2704.66s)]
*  the for all the [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2706.7400000000002s)]
*  You know self-flagellation that we've been doing as democrats about we became too oppositional just to trump and what do we stand for and? [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2708.66s)]
*  they they're absolutely driven by [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2716.66s)]
*  Things that people like you and I were upset about you know, like in other words [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2721.2200000000003s)]
*  Liberals didn't like it mo because america tortured people there and it became a symbol of all the excesses of the war and terror [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2726.9s)]
*  And and it's like [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2734.66s)]
*  Because we didn't like it. We're gonna put 30 000 people there exactly, you know, this is what is so [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2736.26s)]
*  strange to me is that [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2742.82s)]
*  They're the ones obsessed with us, you know, and like we have no power you guys won. I'm a loser [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2745.38s)]
*  Yeah, we're total losers here. I got [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2751.3s)]
*  A podcast and it's like we're gonna put 30 000 people in gitmo [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2753.7000000000003s)]
*  To own these libs, you know, they they will never reach the end of owning us, you know [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2758.7400000000002s)]
*  It serves no purpose. It's expensive. It's horrible for a reputation in the world [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2764.9s)]
*  It's absurd that there even is this like prison in cuba that we control [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2769.7000000000003s)]
*  and and and yet [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2775.46s)]
*  Precisely because it's maximally offensive like that's the only that's the only reason to do it [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2777.94s)]
*  You know, there's not any other reason to do it. No, and and that that there's something so [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2783.38s)]
*  Dark and strange about that [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2787.94s)]
*  And yet it is kind of the beating heart of of maga [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2790.34s)]
*  It's just to kind of stick it to us own the libs and and inflict pain and cruelty and suffering on random people [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2793.7s)]
*  Vulnerable people and all the better if they're if they're not white people of color [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2801.14s)]
*  Yeah, um a few more things ben before we get to uh the kind of netanyahu section of this by the way [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2804.8199999999997s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2809.8599999999997s)]
*  And i'm gonna say this in the comic way, but it's like tragicomic imagine being one of these [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2811.9399999999996s)]
*  Detainees in gitmo. I was thinking about that too. The 15 guys who've been there for 20 years who were like what is happening? [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2817.3599999999997s)]
*  30 000 people having a fucking golf course [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2823.2999999999997s)]
*  Who is it who's there? It was like ksm [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2828.18s)]
*  The worst people maybe it'll become like some horrible terrorist army, I don't know [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2830.8199999999997s)]
*  Well, I I mean, yeah, there are security questions. I mean you're just creating a giant camp [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2835.06s)]
*  With as trump says the worst of the worst trendy aragua gang members like it seems [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2840.8999999999996s)]
*  unsafe anyway, um one to watch a couple more things so ben over the weekend, uh, the trump administration [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=2846.58s)]

*  It's happened over and over again and it's going to happen again as sure as you're standing there peter [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3441.08s)]
*  so [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3447.4s)]
*  I hope that we could do something where they wouldn't want to go back who wouldn't want to go back [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3449.24s)]
*  They've experienced nothing but death and destruction. So ben it does it does seem like uh, no one's getting around about this [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3454.04s)]
*  Plan to death and cleanse gaza. I mean [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3460.8399999999997s)]
*  No, uh [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3463.96s)]
*  I and I think we have to pause and just remember [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3465.96s)]
*  First of all [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3468.6s)]
*  This guy nanyau is [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3472.68s)]
*  Been charged with war crimes by the national criminal court [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3475.96s)]
*  And that's how most of the world sees him, right? [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3479.7999999999997s)]
*  And he's the first foreign visitor to the trump white house. Um, and [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3483.48s)]
*  so [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3487.72s)]
*  Basically trump talks about how gaza has been completely destroyed, right? He's [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3488.68s)]
*  Sitting next to the guy [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3494.2s)]
*  Who destroyed it? [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3495.96s)]
*  With help from joe biden in the form of weapons [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3497.72s)]
*  And just that and that's not normal either it fits with what we're saying about their fixation on on the libs and stuff [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3501.3199999999997s)]
*  Usually the first foreign trip is to canada or mexico the first foreign visitors canada mexico now [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3507.8799999999997s)]
*  We threaten trade wars with them and it's not normal for the first foreign visitor to be the israeli prime minister [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3514.12s)]
*  In that it almost feels designed. It just shows how much politics have captured [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3520.4399999999996s)]
*  The republican party and and trump and and just even how [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3525.7200000000003s)]
*  Nobody's even pointing out that that's unusual, you know, right? [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3530.76s)]
*  And also the the only foreign aid that's not cut off is to israel and to egypt to support israel [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3533.0s)]
*  it shows you how much american identity politics kind of captured, uh, [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3537.2400000000002s)]
*  american foreign policy because [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3541.16s)]
*  This would not [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3544.04s)]
*  This doesn't make sense in any other way, you know [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3545.4s)]
*  now [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3547.96s)]
*  Let's be clear too [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3548.92s)]
*  Like he's literally just sitting there making a more aggressive case for ethnically cleansing the palestinians [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3549.8s)]
*  We've talked about they don't want to leave gaza the neighboring countries don't want them to [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3555.7200000000003s)]
*  Leave gaza. They know if they leave gaza [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3560.52s)]
*  They'll never go back the people that want them to leave gaza are like ben gavir and the most right-wing elements in the israeli coalition [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3562.6800000000003s)]
*  Because they want to settle gaza and have it be part of israel and ethnically cleanse it [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3569.7200000000003s)]
*  That's what's happening. I mean that's the president of the united states [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3575.0s)]
*  With his first foreign visitor endorsing the ethnic cleansing of a people [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3578.2s)]
*  and [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3584.04s)]
*  I mean that that's what happened. Yeah, it's also worth you know, I always read the kind of preview stories before netanyahu visit because uh, [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3585.0s)]
*  There's very purposeful leaks and there's two I wanted to talk about the the post [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3592.3599999999997s)]
*  Washington post talked about all the pressure on netanyahu [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3597.16s)]
*  From hit the right wing of his coalition to not complete the ceasefire deal to basically end it after this [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3599.8799999999997s)]
*  First phase this first 42 days and then resume fighting because people like smotrich the right wing finance minister [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3607.16s)]
*  Uh don't want the deal to go through they don't want the israelis to ever leave gaza [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3615.08s)]
*  And what that would mean in practice is [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3620.2s)]
*  um that second tranche of male hostages [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3622.6s)]
*  Doesn't get out and the ief forces don't leave the gaza strip and things just return to how they were a few weeks ago [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3625.96s)]
*  Which would be a catastrophic [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3633.96s)]
*  You know action for [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3636.52s)]
*  Every human being in gaza. I mean, I think all the humanitarian aid would stop flowing into gaza and then during this [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3638.6s)]
*  This before netanyahu came into the oval trump did this little event with himself and his team where he signed some executive orders [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3644.92s)]
*  One of them was reimposing maximum pressure on iran [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3652.44s)]
*  Going back to his strategy from the first administration and then I noticed there was a article in the new york times [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3655.64s)]
*  Uh about new intelligence the u.s [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3661.4s)]
*  Has about iranian scientists exploring a faster approach to developing nuclear weapons [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3664.04s)]
*  So it does seem like that was a bit of a pretext to get back to this maximum pressure strategy [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3669.08s)]
*  And I don't know maybe you pick back up the conversations about military strikes on the iranian nuclear [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3673.7200000000003s)]
*  Infrastructure and then the trump signed a second eo [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3680.82s)]
*  Withdrawing the u.s from unra and the un human rights council and that [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3684.52s)]
*  Unroad withdrawal on top of the israelis stopping cooperation [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3689.32s)]
*  With unra makes you wonder how any humanitarian relief is going to get into gaza if this war starts back up [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3693.24s)]
*  And I just I don't know [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3698.7599999999998s)]
*  We had the you know head of uh director of unra and gaza on a couple weeks ago [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3700.52s)]
*  And he was saying that this unra ban in israel if it's supplemented too by the u.s [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3704.7599999999998s)]
*  You know will paralyze their ability to operate and if you think about it the usid cut off [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3708.6s)]
*  Has paralyzed the ability of usid to deliver its part of the humanitarian ceasefire. So if you're basically shutting down [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3714.7599999999998s)]
*  usid and trying to shut down unra [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3722.34s)]
*  You're not going to be able to get you know, you're not going to be able to keep the humanitarian part of the [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3725.88s)]
*  The ceasefire terms. I don't think that's going to keep uh trump up at night [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3730.2799999999997s)]
*  Um, that's the first thing the second thing is you know [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3734.04s)]
*  Which by the way is a hell of a pretext for that ethnic cleansing operation. Yeah, they'll be like wow [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3737.72s)]
*  We can't get any humanitarian relief into gaza. We got to get everybody out [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3742.44s)]
*  Yeah, and what will happen is the most vulnerable people will probably leave and a bunch of hamas fighters will stay and they'll be this [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3745.2400000000002s)]
*  guerrilla war for god knows how long yes, absolutely. Um, [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3752.28s)]
*  and and you know, the other thing is [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3757.08s)]
*  The people that like to throw around charges of anti-semitism, you know one of their [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3761.64s)]
*  You know allegations essentially is is don't claim that the u.s [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3767.08s)]
*  You know makes policies in the middle east, you know on behalf of israel [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3771.72s)]
*  well one way to [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3776.52s)]
*  Reinforce that [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3779.06s)]
*  this you know [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3780.92s)]
*  Impression is to sign your iran policy on the eve of meeting with the fucking israeli prime minister [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3782.44s)]
*  Good point, you know, I I mean I think that we have an iran policy that should be rooted in u.s [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3788.12s)]
*  Interest not an iran policy that is like a a housewarming gift to bb nana when he comes to visit [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3793.88s)]
*  And then the last thing i'd say is part of what worries me [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3800.36s)]
*  About the trump presidency vis-a-vis [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3804.1200000000003s)]
*  The israeli right wing is if you are smotra at your bangavere you you are thinking [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3806.76s)]
*  We'll never have an opportunity like this, you know, we've got this guy in there for four years [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3812.36s)]
*  Who doesn't give a shit about the palestinians? [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3816.6000000000004s)]
*  Doesn't give a shit about international opinion [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3818.84s)]
*  Is willing to break any international norm? So if ever there was a time to depopulate gaza [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3821.2400000000002s)]
*  Or to annex the west bank we we have to go now [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3826.36s)]
*  And so it incentivizes them to push netanyahu harder to break the ceasefire [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3830.12s)]
*  Or to to do something in gaza or the west bank that they wouldn't do [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3835.08s)]
*  With even a joe biden in there give them a pretty blank check [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3839.88s)]
*  And by the way [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3843.48s)]
*  you know, uh [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3844.92s)]
*  If you're an iranian scientist [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3846.52s)]
*  The trump presidency is a time where you might be like [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3849.48s)]
*  Shit man, maybe we need a nuclear weapon, you know, like all these other countries are going to make these judgments based on the [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3852.2s)]
*  You know extreme nature of trump and and where that what what does that lead them to do? [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3860.04s)]
*  That's that's always been a concern of mine. Yeah, this is a scary one in just the beginning and um, you know [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3864.8399999999997s)]
*  I guess we're counting on steve witkoff. So keep the ceasefire on track by all accounts seems to really support a two-state solution [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3870.7599999999998s)]
*  So, I don't know like uh, let's get witkoff out front and center [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3878.36s)]
*  I don't know that guy has some juice and trump is disinterested and maybe he can keep this thing on track [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3881.96s)]
*  But i'm i'm not all that hopeful. Uh, okay [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3886.2s)]
*  Pause the world listeners. It is now 7 30 pm eastern trump just finished his press conference with prime minister bb netanyahu [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3889.48s)]
*  What we played for you earlier was part of what's called a pool spray [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3898.04s)]
*  So that is when the two leaders sit down in the oval office [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3902.12s)]
*  Uh often the press staff brings in the reporters briefly [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3905.4s)]
*  Uh, they get some images and photos. Sometimes they shout a few questions, which you guys heard [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3909.48s)]
*  Trump and netanyahu answer then they had their meeting [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3915.0800000000004s)]
*  They are one-on-one in the oval or whatever it was and then they went to a different part of the white house for an official [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3918.6000000000004s)]
*  press conference [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3923.6400000000003s)]
*  Uh that press conference just wrapped and here is a clip that we wanted to play for you guys [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3924.84s)]
*  And by the way, this is just tommy solo because ben had to go home to pick up his kids, but we thought that [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3931.0s)]
*  this [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3936.92s)]
*  Uh announcement that donald trump just made uh was shocking enough that we needed to do an addendum to the podcast to make sure you [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3938.04s)]
*  Heard it the u.s. Will take over the gaza strip and we will do a job with it, too [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3944.6s)]
*  We'll own it. I do see a long-term [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3950.2000000000003s)]
*  Ownership position and I see it bringing great stability to that part of the middle east and maybe the entire middle east [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3953.38s)]
*  And everybody i've spoken to this was not a decision made lightly everybody i've spoken to loves the idea of the united states [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3961.48s)]
*  Owning that piece of land. So yes, you just heard what you think you heard [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3969.0s)]
*  Donald trump says the united states is going to take over the gaza strip and occupy it. Um trump was asked [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3973.7200000000003s)]
*  Whether this was a temporary thing or long term and he said that the u.s is going to take a long-term ownership position [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3980.92s)]
*  Of gaza, I guess he's viewing this [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3987.64s)]
*  As a building or an asset trump was asked if he would send u.s troops to gaza as part of this [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3990.2s)]
*  Annexation process, uh, and he said quote if it's necessary, we'll do that. We're going to take over that piece and we're going to develop it [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=3997.54s)]
*  um, so [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4004.7599999999998s)]
*  For everyone keep in score at home here. Trump has now said the united states should annex gaza [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4006.2s)]
*  greenland [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4012.44s)]
*  Uh, potentially the panama canal [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4013.48s)]
*  He keeps joking about canada becoming the 51st state and a joke that's [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4015.72s)]
*  Seeming more serious every day. So I guess uh, this is america first foreign policy. This is restraint. This is trump [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4020.6s)]
*  Honoring his pledge to end wars and not get u.s troops involved in in conflict overseas. That's what we're seeing here [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4027.88s)]
*  um, so I don't know I I wish ben was here because um [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4034.28s)]
*  Just sort of have my jaw on the table here [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4039.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm going to be very interested to see what the international reaction to this announcement is you have to [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4041.3199999999997s)]
*  Imagine it will not be well received in most capitals [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4046.8399999999997s)]
*  Uh on the so-called arab street, uh, you can imagine a lot of right-wing [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4051.3999999999996s)]
*  Israelis being angry about the idea of the u.s controlling a territory that a lot of them should think should be part of israel [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4056.2599999999998s)]
*  And then of course, I mean it goes without saying that [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4063.24s)]
*  People in gaza people in the west bank [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4065.7999999999997s)]
*  They are going to fight this idea tooth and nail, I mean gaza is their home two million people live there [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4068.28s)]
*  Um gaza is a part of what has long been envisioned as a future palestinian state the idea that [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4074.84s)]
*  People in gaza just want to live there because they have no other option [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4082.92s)]
*  Is bullshit? [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4087.1600000000003s)]
*  um, it is [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4088.52s)]
*  patronizing and dishonest and wrong these [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4090.82s)]
*  People this is someone's home. This is home to millions of people [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4094.1200000000003s)]
*  And donald trump just announced that uh, the u.s is going to push them all out of it and redevelop it and then own it in perpetuity [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4097.8s)]
*  Um, so I don't know. It's a long ways. I guess from this announcement to this actually happening, but um, [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4105.320000000001s)]
*  This was uh, I don't get shocked that often by things donald trump says [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4111.24s)]
*  um, I was [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4114.84s)]
*  Thought it was shocking enough for the united states president to announce a policy of ethnic cleansing of the gaza strip [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4116.04s)]
*  But now I guess we're planning to occupy it. So that's why we broke back into the show [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4121.16s)]
*  Uh why it's just me solo and why we wanted to update you on all of this [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4126.04s)]
*  And uh, i'm sure we'll cover more next week [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4130.84s)]
*  Okay [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4133.16s)]
*  I'm very pleased to be joined by ustra al bagheer who is the africa correspondent for sky news and has been covering [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4133.4s)]
*  Including on the ground the situation in the democratic republic of the congo [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4141.0s)]
*  Ustra, uh, thanks so much for joining us [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4144.92s)]
*  Thanks for having me ben [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4147.24s)]
*  Okay, I I wanted to start by um [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4148.76s)]
*  Giving people an update on where things stand and then we'll go back and talk a bit about how we got here [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4152.120000000001s)]
*  But um, what is your uh latest understanding of what is happening? [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4156.120000000001s)]
*  On the ground. I know there's been [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4160.6s)]
*  Talked from m23 about a ceasefire [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4162.76s)]
*  Um, but but what is your understanding where things stand? [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4165.4800000000005s)]
*  And as it stands bodies are being recovered at least 900 people were killed in just those five days of fighting [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4168.52s)]
*  during the takeover of goma [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4176.68s)]
*  and at least [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4178.68s)]
*  29,900 were injured but we're expecting that number to rise [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4180.240000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's it's a bit of a [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4184.18s)]
*  Cleanup operation from what i'm seeing there's still that kind of shock of what's happened over a very short period of time [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4186.34s)]
*  M23 are positioning themselves as you know a de facto governing body. They've said that they want to set up a local administration [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4193.700000000001s)]
*  I mean we spoke to the general, uh of that area when we left and he was very much putting forward this [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4201.9400000000005s)]
*  This presentation of them being [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4208.88s)]
*  Following ihl though. He mistakenly called it i ihr [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4212.58s)]
*  um [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4216.900000000001s)]
*  Apologizing for the mess that that we were witness to and saying, you know how it is [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4218.08s)]
*  We're fighting for our survival and this is this is what happens with war unfortunately [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4223.14s)]
*  so there is a kind of [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4228.42s)]
*  This i'd say [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4231.06s)]
*  pr [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4233.14s)]
*  campaign happening, uh trying to make m23 look like [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4234.42s)]
*  They could govern goma. They could replace the congolese state [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4238.58s)]
*  But as this is happening reports are coming out that they're actually moving south to south kivo now [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4242.74s)]
*  um, and that they're reinforcing their positions in south kivu and that they might be kind of [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4248.9800000000005s)]
*  Descending on bukavu the capital of south kivu in a similar way that they that they took over goma [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4254.72s)]
*  They're very ambitious. Uh, I would be surprised if they were stopping at goma though [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4260.74s)]
*  With goma they now have kind of the heart [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4266.18s)]
*  of [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4269.94s)]
*  north kivu of the eastern drc [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4270.74s)]
*  Which borders rwanda their backers, but also the country where they want to funnel out the resources [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4273.7s)]
*  So, you know, they've been making some, uh gains over the last few months. Um in the countryside [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4281.14s)]
*  goma [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4288.98s)]
*  Was obviously a dramatic escalation [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4290.26s)]
*  What is your sense of of why this is happening now, um, was it opportunistic was this a decision taken? [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4293.240000000001s)]
*  By m23 by rwanda. Why why are we watching? [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4301.320000000001s)]
*  This kind of emergence of m23 again [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4306.12s)]
*  I mean it depends on who you ask m23 will say they're fighting for their survival [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4309.16s)]
*  They're fighting for their you know, the existential threat of the congolese state supporting fdlr, which is [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4313.08s)]
*  Uh militias born out of the same militias that carried out the rwandan genocide against the tutsis [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4320.68s)]
*  Rwanda will say that they're securing their border that they're preserving the sovereign integrity of their state [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4326.9s)]
*  But I mean it really does just feel like a land grab [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4333.08s)]
*  It feels like it's all about money at a time where the eu by signing [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4336.04s)]
*  a memorandum of understanding with rwanda an agreement [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4341.32s)]
*  To uh use rwandan resources for clean energy in europe [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4345.240000000001s)]
*  When rwanda doesn't have any resources, so I think there was a lot of complicity [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4352.04s)]
*  uh from europe [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4357.320000000001s)]
*  around what rwanda was doing through m23 in plain sight this kind of [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4359.400000000001s)]
*  You know consistent [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4364.52s)]
*  seizing of territory seizing of mining territory [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4366.6s)]
*  and just before we went to goma I was I was [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4370.52s)]
*  Speaking to a close colleague who's you know worked in the drc for decades? [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4373.56s)]
*  And we spoke about the significance of goma and the question was you know, they've been engaging in economic war [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4379.4800000000005s)]
*  Why would they want goma? [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4385.0s)]
*  And you know, he argued that goma isn't that is they don't need goma [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4387.72s)]
*  They probably won't take it because of the backlash but arriving in goma and speaking to [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4392.04s)]
*  You know senior monesco colonels [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4397.72s)]
*  They made it very clear that goma is it's it's a it's the symbolic [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4400.2s)]
*  Move it's to show that they are here to stay [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4405.08s)]
*  Through goma they have access to the border with rwanda, but they also have access to an international airport [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4408.68s)]
*  They they want the heart of the region. They're not going to just take the mines [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4414.360000000001s)]
*  They've already got the mines, but I think they do actually want to set up a de facto state [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4418.280000000001s)]
*  And for people who don't follow this that closely what what are the resources we're talking about in terms of the mining resources the resources that [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4424.76s)]
*  Rwanda would want to cut out the resources that europe wants to import. Well, we've got the three t's [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4432.4400000000005s)]
*  tin tantalum tungsten, but we've also got cobalt [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4438.2s)]
*  Europe the the european demand for the 3t supply chain really comes down to [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4443.64s)]
*  electric cars and microchips [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4451.08s)]
*  And that's one of the things that had been driving campaigns [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4454.04s)]
*  Social media campaigns around the congo [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4458.6s)]
*  Was that our iphones are part of this? [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4461.72s)]
*  conflict supply chain [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4465.64s)]
*  Electric vehicles are involved in this conflict supply chain that everyone [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4467.32s)]
*  Is kind of turning away from the suffering and the mass displacement and the huge humanitarian repercussions of our own consumption [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4471.96s)]
*  That's you know, I think that was that point had been made very early on last year, but also we saw [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4479.4s)]
*  lawsuits against big tech in the us be thrown out of court [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4487.38s)]
*  And then recently we've seen those lawsuits be enlivened from france and belgium [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4491.5599999999995s)]
*  Trying to make the point that there's an issue with the supply chain that these minerals are coming from mines where not only are they [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4498.12s)]
*  Captured through war but it's also children child miners have been well documented in these mines [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4505.160000000001s)]
*  You've got horrific conditions for artisanal miners, but also a un panel of experts report [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4510.6s)]
*  Said that they make m23 make eight hundred thousand dollars a month on taxes in mining areas [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4516.76s)]
*  So it's this it almost feels like a criminal syndicate. I mean they're making money from from in so many different ways [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4524.4400000000005s)]
*  Around these mines and rubiah is home to one of the largest cobalt mines in the world. It's just incredibly rich [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4531.4800000000005s)]
*  So [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4541.08s)]
*  Again with the with the eu signing this agreement with roanda [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4542.12s)]
*  february 2024 [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4547.08s)]
*  Came as a huge shock to mineral experts in europe [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4549.0s)]
*  Because there was no way the trade data roanda's trade data could stand up an agreement where they're basically saying roanda is going to supply [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4552.2s)]
*  Europe with all these resources for their clean sustainable future [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4560.280000000001s)]
*  And in and in return giving roanda 750 around 750 million pounds we'd say 900 euro [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4564.52s)]
*  A million fund from their global gateway strategy that the eu set up as an alternative to china's belt and road initiative [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4571.88s)]
*  but you know, i've been speaking to experts about this and one thing that sticks is [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4579.320000000001s)]
*  Is [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4583.72s)]
*  Even though now there's pressure especially from belgian members of european parliament [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4584.84s)]
*  You know center right and even you know [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4590.52s)]
*  Center right left wing members of european parliament for the this deal to be suspended the still with randa [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4593.16s)]
*  The problem is there will always be buyers [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4599.56s)]
*  Of conflict minerals and I think the concern is is that even if there's this pressure [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4602.52s)]
*  For the eu to suspend this deal [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4607.8s)]
*  Randa could just turn to china and have those minerals sold to the chinese. So [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4609.8s)]
*  Rwanda, I think is in a position where [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4615.88s)]
*  They've got access they've got a proxy force and they've also got a sense of [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4619.64s)]
*  Almost a moral justification from the genocide [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4625.56s)]
*  That they are using to say we are protecting tootsies [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4629.400000000001s)]
*  Whether they're congolese or rwandan by supporting m23 [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4634.92s)]
*  And when you were in goma and in talking to people [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4639.400000000001s)]
*  Where has the congolese state been the congolese armed forces? [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4643.4800000000005s)]
*  um [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4648.68s)]
*  You know presumably, you know, obviously this is their territory [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4649.56s)]
*  What what happened to the security forces and the authority of the the congolese state and what are they trying to do? [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4654.12s)]
*  to deal with this [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4660.84s)]
*  growing presence of m.3 [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4662.68s)]
*  It's incredibly fractured. Um [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4665.240000000001s)]
*  And [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4667.96s)]
*  I mean we were there senior far dc. That's the congolese armed forces commanders fled by ferry [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4669.16s)]
*  They were fleeing over lake ivu en masse in boats until m23. Then when they had enough control band movement over the lake [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4675.719999999999s)]
*  We you know, the the the few military senior military commanders that we met one of them was kind of their head of media [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4683.719999999999s)]
*  um was just [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4690.679999999999s)]
*  I mean we asked if he could take us to the front line and he looked at us like even I don't want to go to the front line [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4692.68s)]
*  I mean m23 were were closing in really quickly and I think [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4697.88s)]
*  By the time we got there [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4702.360000000001s)]
*  Everyone was I mean at that senior kind of top brass level they were figuring out how they were going to extract themselves [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4704.200000000001s)]
*  but there was [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4712.04s)]
*  There were pockets of resistance. There was a group of around 350 [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4714.6s)]
*  50 special forces congolese forces [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4718.06s)]
*  Who were holding it down holding down the fort they were fighting in mount goma with m23 and then they moved down and were fighting [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4721.660000000001s)]
*  at street level [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4728.14s)]
*  Just as we saw masses [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4729.900000000001s)]
*  Of congolese soldiers surrender as well and we just just from outside our hotel [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4732.06s)]
*  We could see them surrender at the un peacekeeping base and then we'd come out to the to the roof when we could kind of [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4736.22s)]
*  Uh pop our heads back up and see their fatigues on the on the road. So [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4742.620000000001s)]
*  There was kind of at the lower levels there was mass surrender from congolese forces in goma at the higher levels [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4747.34s)]
*  there were there was just [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4753.82s)]
*  senior commanders fleeing and then there was this group of special forces that were trying to [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4755.66s)]
*  At least put up a fight to not give goma up so easily that it's captured in a day [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4761.66s)]
*  and [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4767.34s)]
*  I think in that sense it was it felt quite noble in that moment because it was definitely [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4768.3s)]
*  They definitely weren't going to win [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4774.22s)]
*  and what about the neighboring [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4776.14s)]
*  governments who've been involved in trying to [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4778.46s)]
*  You know keep some modicum of stability or peace in the past [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4781.9800000000005s)]
*  I saw a war of words between [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4787.58s)]
*  President kagame and rwanda president ramaphosa and in south africa [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4790.46s)]
*  Is it what is the role for? [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4794.9400000000005s)]
*  The neighboring states and and what is the current dynamic in terms of trying to prevent this from escalating further? [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4797.42s)]
*  I mean we've seen that uganda and burundi may get involved and burundi [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4804.219999999999s)]
*  It seems clear which side with the congolese state in [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4810.78s)]
*  Fighting m23 because south kivu is on burundi's border on their western border [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4815.5s)]
*  Uganda it's interesting because I think traditionally uganda would step in on the congolese side, but I mean you just read [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4823.42s)]
*  you read tweets by [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4831.099999999999s)]
*  Museveni's son who's like a complete, you know, maverick [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4833.18s)]
*  Um, and he's saying that he's a dan jr of uganda. Yeah. Yeah exactly [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4838.06s)]
*  um [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4843.1s)]
*  ruto president ruto of kenya saying he wants to hold a summit an extraordinary summit the ruto has lost a lot of credibility with [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4844.3s)]
*  how he handled the protests in his own country [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4851.42s)]
*  and south, you know kagame and [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4854.9400000000005s)]
*  Ramaphosa actually ended up having twitter beef which was shocking to everyone where kagame directly quote tweeted ramaphosa [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4858.3s)]
*  After ramaphosa called the randon defense force is a militia [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4866.38s)]
*  um [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4870.78s)]
*  And kagame had a lot to say about that. So [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4872.14s)]
*  It's it's concerning that it does feel like a sense that it's spreading [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4875.82s)]
*  But I also feel like there would be a lot of hesitation to engage [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4879.26s)]
*  Multinationally and even regionally. I mean I could see burundi getting involved and I couldn't [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4883.9800000000005s)]
*  The proximity is enough for that. I think uganda's too split on on who to side with [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4889.42s)]
*  But in terms of south african rwanda [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4895.9800000000005s)]
*  I mean, I think what happened here was that there was just such outrage around south african [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4898.9400000000005s)]
*  troops being killed [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4904.700000000001s)]
*  In a in a fight that isn't theirs like a lot of outrage and I think [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4906.860000000001s)]
*  The presidency and senior ministers here were responding [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4911.259999999999s)]
*  to [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4915.0199999999995s)]
*  A lot of hate towards rwanda and a lot of a lot of anger towards the government [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4916.78s)]
*  But it felt very brash. It didn't feel like a a war cry [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4921.9s)]
*  And I think that tension though will be hard to dispel considering how far it's gone and and the words that have been shared but [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4926.0599999999995s)]
*  I mean, I think we [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4934.46s)]
*  Regionally, there's an issue. I wouldn't say, you know cross-continentally [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4936.139999999999s)]
*  We'll see that kind of conflict play out on the ground [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4940.08s)]
*  I mean, so as you've described this, you know, nobody comes out looking particularly good in the sense that you know [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4943.599999999999s)]
*  The europeans are buying conflict minerals [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4948.24s)]
*  The rwandans are obviously backing m23. The region is trying to figure out [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4951.76s)]
*  Where it stands? [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4956.88s)]
*  Um, I want to ask you about the people. Um, you were in goma [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4958.4s)]
*  These people have been through, you know endless cycles of violence [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4962.64s)]
*  Um brutal tactics, you know m23 is known to use rape as a weapon of war [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4966.8s)]
*  Um, what was the sense among the people that you spoke to about what how they see things and what they want? [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4972.32s)]
*  I mean, I think [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4978.88s)]
*  There, you know the the day before the takeover even though it was imminent and they were approaching [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4980.72s)]
*  There was [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4986.72s)]
*  a life as normal [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4988.08s)]
*  Vibe where that kind of [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4990.88s)]
*  Battle hardenedness or that sense of kind of [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4993.76s)]
*  They've been through this before or being jaded felt like it was there people were getting on with it [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=4998.24s)]
*  It was just like busy roads. There was no sense of [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5003.04s)]
*  Hiding away. I think people were still just continuing their life as normal until they couldn't [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5008.88s)]
*  Until they had to take cover for two days because of constant shelling and gunfire [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5014.24s)]
*  Um, there was no electricity and there was no running water [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5018.72s)]
*  It had been switched off and the congolese were saying was m23 and then m23 was saying it was the congolese government [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5022.4s)]
*  um [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5027.92s)]
*  but I think [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5029.5199999999995s)]
*  There was definitely [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5031.36s)]
*  this rising dread [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5033.28s)]
*  Underneath from when we landed in the airport [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5035.84s)]
*  I mean even the way people were you know, it wasn't even just the normal hustle and bustle of an airport [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5037.92s)]
*  There was a sense of like [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5042.16s)]
*  Everyone's just trying to get as much money as they can before things go bust [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5043.84s)]
*  the the days that followed we spent I mean we spent most of it in our hotel reporting from the hotel and we [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5047.599999999999s)]
*  Were well positioned because we were very close to the border [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5054.08s)]
*  And we were also next to the UN peacekeeping base and downtown where the fighting was really bad [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5056.32s)]
*  But I think mostly I was reading [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5061.28s)]
*  You know getting my cues off of the hotel staff and I think [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5064.639999999999s)]
*  There was just this sense of [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5068.719999999999s)]
*  Decorum and dignity and care through all of that [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5071.04s)]
*  but still [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5074.639999999999s)]
*  Heartbreak still a real sense of uncertainty. I mean you'd speak to one person and they'd say we just want peace [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5077.280000000001s)]
*  I think most of the people we you know, we just want peace if it's m23 great if it's not it's not [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5084.56s)]
*  But then when you speak to another person who's fed up with the congolese government, it's corruption [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5090.0s)]
*  You know the state capture the fact that congolese the congolese army and you know aligned militias are as guilty [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5094.56s)]
*  Of committing atrocities as m23 fed up happy for m23 to come in and clean up shop and see what happens next [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5102.08s)]
*  But the thing we kept hearing again and again is we just want peace. There's just an element of it being so exhausting [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5108.8s)]
*  Just just completely exhausting. I mean 2012 [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5115.52s)]
*  Um goma was captured by m23 didn't last long and there was a peace deal that was brokered after that [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5119.120000000001s)]
*  But this is the fifth time [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5125.68s)]
*  since the 90s [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5128.240000000001s)]
*  Since the genocide, uh in rwanda that goma has been captured [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5130.08s)]
*  By rwandan-backed rebels. So not necessarily m23 but rwandan-backed rebels [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5135.36s)]
*  and twice [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5140.64s)]
*  two of those times [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5142.5599999999995s)]
*  During the congo wars rwanda invaded its neighbor invaded the drc [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5144.08s)]
*  so this is not new to them and these cycles keep happening, but [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5150.24s)]
*  definitely increasing in violence increasing in [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5154.72s)]
*  uh, just [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5158.240000000001s)]
*  Deprivation a sense of [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5160.3s)]
*  desperation and honestly just [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5163.34s)]
*  Hopelessness [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5166.38s)]
*  Because they keep rebuilding and they keep making jiu and they keep finding ways through but [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5167.6s)]
*  At what cost and I think rwanda is becoming much more brazen with its support in recent years of m23 [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5172.400000000001s)]
*  And has the resources to do so considering its partnerships with different [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5178.56s)]
*  You know western governments and [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5182.8s)]
*  You know kagami has been called the west's favorite dictator for many years now [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5184.88s)]
*  And it's the people in the drc who felt that on a very [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5189.44s)]
*  real level [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5194.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean one last question just listening to talk. Uh [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5196.4s)]
*  I'm trying to phrase this the right way. I mean a lot of the people in western governments and people in kind of in global philanthropy [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5201.28s)]
*  Uh, you know who focus on africa and you you know cover africa [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5209.14s)]
*  um, you know strangely [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5214.26s)]
*  The same kind of people that might celebrate kagami for you know advances [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5216.740000000001s)]
*  He's made in development and forged decades-long relationships with him [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5220.740000000001s)]
*  he's very connected in western governments and kind of the [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5224.34s)]
*  african philanthropic community they're like the same kind of people that you know also celebrate denis mcquague the [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5227.14s)]
*  Uh congolese doctor who won the noble peace prize for the work he's done with women affected by rape in eastern congo [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5234.18s)]
*  I just hearing you talk made me think about the strangeness of this reality [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5241.94s)]
*  I mean [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5245.46s)]
*  What what needs to change about how people who think that they care about africa have gone about you know spending their dollars? [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5246.66s)]
*  uh [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5254.1s)]
*  Because this seems like there's a lot of obviously contradiction [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5254.98s)]
*  Embedded in you know giving awards to people that help [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5258.5s)]
*  women affected by [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5262.26s)]
*  conflict while also giving money to [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5264.26s)]
*  Kagame who you know is in part behind a lot of the conflict does that make sense? [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5267.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I think the one thing that I come up against a lot [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5272.82s)]
*  I mean i'm from sudan and I I feel like the thing that drives that cynical approach to africa to sudan to the drc [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5276.5s)]
*  Um to other countries on the continent is this sense that we're kind of almost predestined to violence [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5284.9800000000005s)]
*  Uh that that's our lot in life that this is just the nature of our countries and of our environments and I think [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5290.820000000001s)]
*  that then gives [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5297.700000000001s)]
*  You know, it's this um [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5299.54s)]
*  Sense that oh if it's not us, you know, if it's not us it will be the chinese if it's not us [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5302.900000000001s)]
*  It'll be the russians, but I think the moral high ground [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5306.660000000001s)]
*  Manifests in that sort of regulatory [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5311.3s)]
*  Necessity you need to regulate the supply chain of minerals [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5315.04s)]
*  You need to be involved in the in the development of institutions on the continent [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5318.099999999999s)]
*  otherwise these awards and [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5323.54s)]
*  These sentiments of you know, liberal [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5326.5s)]
*  values and development of africa, they they just feel very hollow [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5329.219999999999s)]
*  and I think [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5333.38s)]
*  This is one of the things that we often face with [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5334.66s)]
*  conflict resolution entities with international mediation is that you know [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5337.62s)]
*  When war does break out the international community will come in we'll make these proclamations of [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5342.9s)]
*  You know, we condemn the violence we condemn [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5348.419999999999s)]
*  uh [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5351.379999999999s)]
*  The the actions of one party or another [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5352.82s)]
*  while actively [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5355.86s)]
*  In deals, you know making deals with one party or the other [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5357.379999999999s)]
*  I mean the eu came out with quite a strong statement condemning [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5361.46s)]
*  Uh m23 and condemning roanda for for its invasion saying it must withdraw its troops from congolese soil [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5365.54s)]

*  I mean when you speak to young people on the continent [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5389.7s)]
*  There's always really a sense of that kind of rising anti-western [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5392.099999999999s)]
*  sentiment comes from that sense of [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5397.219999999999s)]
*  You don't let us into your countries, you know, you don't develop you you you basically [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5400.5s)]

*  A structure a global structure that puts kind of the western perspective at the forefront [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5416.74s)]
*  And yet you claim the moral high ground [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5422.339999999999s)]
*  And that's across africa [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDify9n8xEw&t=5425.299999999999s)]
