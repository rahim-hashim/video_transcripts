# Trump Defends Hoarding Classified Docs In Fox News Interview
**Pod Save the World:** [June 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg)
*  Welcome back to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Ben Rhodes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=0.0s)]
*  So Ben, this is like our podcast Jordan Flu Game because you're in Greece, right? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3.64s)]
*  I'm in Athens. Yeah, I'm in Athens and [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=9.88s)]
*  I'm very far away and it's very hot here, but it's nice. It's nice. It's nice hot. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=13.08s)]
*  I'm in Los Angeles, but the crooked media HQ internet is down. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=18.56s)]
*  So, you know, typical thing that happens to a media company in 2023. So we're doing a double remote here. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=22.72s)]
*  But nothing can stop us from potting. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=29.12s)]
*  We got a great show today. We're gonna talk about [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=31.68s)]
*  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the US. Trump's Fox News interview about his Mar-a-Lago [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=34.2s)]
*  documents case. Interesting legal strategy there to go on TV. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=39.96s)]
*  Tony Blinken, the Secretary of State, made his long-awaited visit to China. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=42.92s)]
*  Got some big news from Israel and Ukraine and then just a wild story about the Russians maybe trying to kill a defector in the US. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  Facebook censorship in Vietnam and then why the former Tory party MPs [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=54.720000000000006s)]
*  don't think anything is funny and they don't want us laughing at them then. So I hope you're ready to not laugh at that. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=60.24s)]
*  Absolutely won't be laughing at that at all, Tony. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=66.2s)]
*  There's nothing. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=68.56s)]
*  There's nothing funny about Boris Johnson or Lashaw. But it was so nice to hear Lammy's [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=70.08000000000001s)]
*  voice on the pod last week. I missed that man's just pronunciation. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=74.64s)]
*  And you know, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=78.0s)]
*  every time Boris Johnson has yet another fall, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=80.66s)]
*  it's very good to have David Lammy come on and you know, just do a little [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=83.82s)]
*  articulate and erudite dunking on Boris. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=87.82s)]
*  Very polite dunking on Boris. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=91.34s)]
*  Well, let's start somewhere. You know, we probably don't talk about enough given the stakes, which is [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=93.82s)]
*  about the Indian government. So the Prime Minister Narendra Modi is visiting Washington this week. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=98.3s)]
*  He is getting fedded with a state dinner. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=103.02s)]
*  He's going to address a joint session of Congress on June 22nd. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=106.3s)]
*  According to The Wall Street Journal, Modi is expected to announce a whole bunch of defense agreements during his visit, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=110.33999999999999s)]
*  including buying high altitude armed predator drones, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=115.82s)]
*  which will help patrol India's border with China. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=119.69999999999999s)]
*  Ben, remember we set a rollout of shit like that all the time. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=121.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=124.41999999999999s)]
*  On the press. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=124.78s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Yeah. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=125.66s)]
*  Big, big drone deliverable. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=127.22s)]
*  Big deliverable. You're giving some drones away. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=129.01999999999998s)]
*  It feels icky. So China looms large over this whole visit. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=132.42000000000002s)]
*  So the US wants India to be a counterweight to Chinese influence. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=135.98000000000002s)]
*  And that strategic goal, I think, is helping us, the United States, I should say, look past [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=139.3s)]
*  frustrations about India's purchase of Russian oil during the war, about Modi fanning the flames of Hindu nationalism, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=146.10000000000002s)]
*  restricting press freedom, and the recent conviction of Rohul Gandhi, the leader of the opposition Congress party, for [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=153.26000000000002s)]
*  defamation of Prime Minister Modi. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=160.29999999999998s)]
*  In March, India's parliament even disqualified Gandhi from parliament itself. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=163.17999999999998s)]
*  So he's sort of off the political table here. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=168.17999999999998s)]
*  So Modi clearly thinks this is India's moment. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=170.17999999999998s)]
*  He wants them to get the shine they deserve. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=174.26s)]
*  They recently surpassed China in terms of total population. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=175.82s)]
*  India is hosting the G20 in the fall. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=178.57999999999998s)]
*  Modi is very popular back home. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=180.78s)]
*  So he's feeling himself. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=182.5s)]
*  So, Ben, you know, look, we're not naive here, right? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=184.06s)]
*  India is obviously a huge and growing player on the global stage. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=186.86s)]
*  I think the US is India's largest trading partner. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=190.62s)]
*  We want to pull them away from the Chinese and the Russians. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=192.94s)]
*  But I'm curious how you think the Biden team should straddle the line between those sort of obvious strategic [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=195.38s)]
*  imperatives and the concerning human rights trajectory in the Hindu nationalism that seems to be [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=201.54s)]
*  growing. And, you know, do you think that making India the third state visit after the French and the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=208.26s)]
*  South Koreans? Does that go too far? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=214.42s)]
*  What's your make? What do you make of that? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=217.57999999999998s)]
*  Well, I think this is like one of the most important stories. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=219.98s)]
*  It doesn't get discussed that much because there are two aspects of it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=222.54s)]
*  You know, the UT. There's a geopolitical aspect and then the what's happening in India part of it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=226.22s)]
*  Right. On the geopolitics, it's quite clear that the United States is all in on trying to hug India as tight [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=230.54s)]
*  as it possibly can in service of its China policy, essentially. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=239.38s)]
*  And all aspects of its China policy. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=244.01999999999998s)]
*  I mean, in terms of like the, you know, relationships that the United States is trying to [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=245.98s)]
*  cultivate in Asia, they've made a big deal about what they call the Quad, which is essentially the US [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=250.42s)]
*  and Japan and Australia and India, you know, have these consultations, have this expanding defense [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=256.5s)]
*  relationship. They've made a big deal of trying to bring India into meetings of the G7. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=261.98s)]
*  They've made a big deal of trying to increase its defense relationship. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=267.62s)]
*  India has traditionally bought a lot of its defense equipment from Russia and its arms from Russia. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=270.54s)]
*  And obviously, the US wants to kind of replace that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=276.26s)]
*  And India is also central to what the US policy is with respect to like we talked about trying to cut [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=279.62s)]
*  China off from certain technologies and try to, you know, cut off investment into Chinese tech sector and [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=286.78s)]
*  Chinese AI and really decoupling supply chains from China so that we're not vulnerable to sensitive [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=292.42s)]
*  technological or other supply chains running through China. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=300.66s)]
*  I think the US would like to see a lot of that private sector investment that's going into China [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=303.46s)]
*  kind of shift over time into India. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=309.14s)]
*  And so it's a huge bet on India. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=311.06s)]
*  And frankly, it builds off of multiple administrations that have been trying to move in this [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=313.26s)]
*  direction. And there's a lot of reason for that. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=317.38s)]
*  India is like the biggest country in the world, right? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=320.22s)]
*  And India is has a huge border with China. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=322.94s)]
*  India has had tensions with China. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=325.86s)]
*  And if you bring India into the equation, I mean, Tommy, like the funniest thing to me about this is [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=327.62s)]
*  that when you and I were in government, we used to refer to the Asia Pacific region. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=332.5s)]
*  It's literally been renamed the Indo-Pacific region, right? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=337.53999999999996s)]
*  I do love that. I love that detail. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=340.58s)]
*  It's such like a like a foreign policy speak translated into like, you know, the real world. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=342.5s)]
*  It's like suddenly we're calling this a different thing. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=346.9s)]
*  But that's because they want to enlarge this conversation. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=349.06s)]
*  So India is at the table as a counterweight to China. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=352.02s)]
*  That all makes sense, right? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=354.5s)]
*  That's what you would rationally want to do geopolitically. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=356.1s)]
*  You want to have as big a team as you can. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=358.34000000000003s)]
*  You want a country of over a billion people with a huge and growing economy to be part of the answer [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=360.58000000000004s)]
*  to these questions. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=365.06s)]
*  The big problem is Narendra Modi is dramatically been backsliding on democracy. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=366.5s)]
*  And these are not small things. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=371.14000000000004s)]
*  I mean, this is like pretty brutal treatment of the enormous Muslim minority inside of India. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=372.42s)]
*  As you said, you know, persecution of the opposition, persecution of journalists, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=379.46000000000004s)]
*  any critics of Modi, you know, face retribution inside of India often. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=383.46000000000004s)]
*  So how do you handle that? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=388.42s)]
*  I mean, look, we have to be pragmatic about the fact that like it's a country where a billion people [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=390.02s)]
*  and for a lot of reasons, you want to engage that country. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=395.94s)]
*  Democracy as well. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=398.42s)]
*  Yeah, democracy as well. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=399.54s)]
*  We we in the Obama years did on climate. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=400.66s)]
*  But I think you can do it if you're going to roll out this big red carpet. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=403.38s)]
*  I'd like to see them at least raise these issues. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=407.7s)]
*  I'd like to see them raise them publicly. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=409.94s)]
*  I'd like to see them raising privately in a polite way. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=411.94s)]
*  And you can again do that in the context of like, hey, we've got our own challenges around [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=414.98s)]
*  democracy. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=418.18s)]
*  I think that we make a mistake in believing that Modi would only cooperate with us on China [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=419.38s)]
*  as like a favorite us when like literally we've talked on this podcast time about like [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=424.58s)]
*  wars, you know, like brutal fights on the border between China and India, you know, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=429.38s)]
*  his troops were beating the shit out of Chinese troops with baseball bats with like nails in them [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=434.18s)]
*  at 14,000 feet in in in the cash beer. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=438.5s)]
*  Right. There's obviously like a reason for him to be to pivot away from the Chinese a [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=442.26s)]
*  little bit. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=446.34s)]
*  That's right. And I'm not saying that's a good thing. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=447.06s)]
*  But like, it's just reality. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=450.98s)]
*  Exactly. That like he is not doing this purely for transactional reasons. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=453.3s)]
*  So I think you can simultaneously try to bring India into a coalition of countries that are [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=456.66s)]
*  concerned about more aggressive Chinese behavior, try to develop and support investment into the [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=461.38s)]
*  Indian economy, try to bring as we did India and the climate change solutions while having [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=466.74s)]
*  honest conversations where we see things that we're concerned about. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=471.78s)]
*  This feels like it's going to be the bear hug without any caveats. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=474.73999999999995s)]
*  And I think you can you can and you can affect, I think, Modi a little bit around, you know, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=478.5s)]
*  certainly on individual cases of people that we're concerned about as just kind of general. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=482.58s)]
*  He's like in the Obama years, Obama would always make a point. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=488.9s)]
*  And I'm not saying we got this exactly right. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=492.26s)]
*  But like, you know, if you went to India, had good relationship with Modi, but he'd go out [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=493.78s)]
*  and give a speech about tolerance and the importance of diversity and importance of [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=497.62s)]
*  recognizing universal rights. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=502.58s)]
*  I think I hope that they at least have a little bit of that built into this. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=503.7s)]
*  Yeah. And I get to imagine that Modi will do like some massive cultural events [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=508.66s)]
*  in different cities, I suspect. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=512.74s)]
*  You know, this is thinking about Ben is it's so interesting. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=514.74s)]
*  I mean, now that we're a couple of years after the full withdrawal from Afghanistan, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=516.66s)]
*  it's interesting to see the degree to which Pakistan has just sort of fallen off the radar [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=521.3s)]
*  screen. I mean, we used to constantly talk about kind of balancing relations between [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=526.02s)]
*  India and Pakistan. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=530.26s)]
*  I remember early on when we created this special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=531.22s)]
*  Richard Holbrooke wanted it to include India, but the Indians were so pissed that they sort [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=536.5799999999999s)]
*  of like got got it pushed out. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=540.34s)]
*  Right. So there's this constant balancing. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=541.6999999999999s)]
*  And it's also amazing that, you know, for decades, one of the most dangerous flash [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=543.6999999999999s)]
*  points in the world was the Kashmir region where India and Pakistan were jockeying for control. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=547.9399999999999s)]
*  India allowed some limited autonomy. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=552.5799999999999s)]
*  That changed 2019. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=554.9s)]
*  India revoked Kashmir's autonomy, sent in thousands of troops, brutalized protesters. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=556.42s)]
*  And now no one seems to know what's going on there really, or ever talks about it. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=561.54s)]
*  It's just kind of like off the radar screen. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=565.78s)]
*  Yeah, it's a sign of how like some of these issues, you know, I mean, we've talked about [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=568.18s)]
*  the Palestinian issue, right? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=571.9399999999999s)]
*  They used to get a lot of international tension. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=573.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=575.22s)]
*  There's been an adjustment to new normal and the kind of, you know, de facto Indian [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=576.26s)]
*  imposition of full control over Kashmir is something that appears to have just kind of [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=580.98s)]
*  been accepted. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=584.66s)]
*  It's funny you bring up the Pakistan history. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=585.7s)]
*  I just want to note, just so people know, we make fun of ourselves on this podcast, too. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=589.22s)]
*  Like we were just as guilty of the Indo-Pacific thing. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=592.66s)]
*  Do you remember the term AFPAC? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=595.78s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=598.02s)]
*  One of the worst like I'm actually embarrassed that I ever uttered those words, but like [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=598.9s)]
*  that's how much we were like, oh, Afghanistan, Pakistan, they're linked, which was true. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=603.86s)]
*  But like, you know, AFPAC is let's just say, I'm glad that one is retired. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=607.54s)]
*  But it does speak to the fact that like, we used to often view the relationship with India [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=611.14s)]
*  through the prism of counterterrorism and our policy in Afghanistan. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=615.78s)]
*  And it's very much evolved to geopolitics. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=619.86s)]
*  And like, make no mistake, like what's complicated about Modi is he is very popular in India, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=621.9399999999999s)]
*  like genuinely popular in part because of this Hindu nationalist politics, in part because [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=627.2199999999999s)]
*  he's kind of made India this bigger player on the world stage. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=634.0999999999999s)]
*  And so like, you're going to have to deal with this leader, like he's an important figure. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=638.02s)]
*  But you can, you know, like, there'll probably be language about this is the world's largest [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=642.5s)]
*  democracy in the world's oldest democracy, right? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=648.0999999999999s)]
*  In the world's largest, US world's oldest, like that, like, let's be careful to make sure that [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=650.18s)]
*  if we're talking about that, we're talking about how both of us have a lot of work to do on [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=655.62s)]
*  democracy. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=659.38s)]
*  And I just think that if there's a full bear hug with no language and no messaging around [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=661.14s)]
*  the importance of respect for human rights, it kind of breeds a cynicism that like, as we [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=666.66s)]
*  talked about before, like the US only talks about those things when it's like Iran or Venezuela, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=671.06s)]
*  not when it's like any one of our friends. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=676.1s)]
*  Yeah, or somebody we need something from. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=678.5799999999999s)]
*  We'll definitely keep an eye on this one. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=680.1s)]
*  I'm sure we'll talk about sort of what came out of the visit next week. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=681.3s)]
*  Pod Save the World is brought to you by Outer Known. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=684.3399999999999s)]

*  Ben, we did want to go back to what we focused on last week, which was the 37 criminal counts [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=951.22s)]
*  laid out in the indictment of President Trump's stealing of classified documents and hoarding [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=958.1s)]
*  them in Mar-a-Lago and then obstruction of justice. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=962.4200000000001s)]
*  So this indictment comes out, Trump's arraigned, and then he did what I guess every smart defendant [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=965.0600000000001s)]
*  does when facing the possibility if he was in prison, he went on Fox News to talk about it [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=972.74s)]
*  in great detail with Brett Baer, friend of the pod. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=977.46s)]
*  Let's hear him out, I guess, and see if he puts this whole thing to rest. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=980.66s)]
*  So this first clip is Trump explaining why he didn't just return the boxes. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=983.46s)]
*  Could we have it back? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=988.5s)]
*  And they asked for it. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=989.3s)]
*  Because they have no, we were talking. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=990.1s)]
*  They did ask for it. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=991.9399999999999s)]
*  No, and I gave them some. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=992.5799999999999s)]
*  They said, can you give the documents back? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=993.38s)]
*  And we were talking. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=994.66s)]
*  And then they said they went to DOJ to subpoena you to get them back. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=995.54s)]
*  Which they've never done before. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=999.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1000.8199999999999s)]
*  And in all fairness- [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1001.3s)]
*  But why not just hand them over then? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1001.78s)]
*  Because I had boxes. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1003.46s)]
*  I want to go through the boxes and get all my personal things out. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1005.06s)]
*  I don't want to hand that over to Narey yet. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1008.58s)]
*  And I was very busy, as you've sort of seen. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1010.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1012.74s)]
*  But according to the indictment, you then tell this aide to move to other locations [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1013.06s)]
*  after telling your lawyers to say you'd fully complied with the subpoena when you hadn't. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1017.14s)]
*  But before I send boxes over, I have to take all of my things out. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1020.98s)]
*  These boxes were interspersed with all sorts of things. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1024.34s)]
*  Golf shirts, clothing, pants, shoes. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1028.34s)]
*  There were many things. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1031.54s)]
*  I would say much, much more. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1032.74s)]
*  Not that I know of, but not that I know of. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1035.3s)]
*  But everything was declassified. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1037.78s)]
*  And Biden didn't have the right to do that because he wasn't president. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1040.02s)]
*  Nor did Mike Pence, by the way, have the right to do that because he wasn't president. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1043.22s)]
*  Ben, it is going to be, first of all, on its face, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1048.26s)]
*  the idea that you can't return the nuclear secrets because you're too busy. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1051.46s)]
*  I just don't think that's going to fly in any court of law. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1054.18s)]
*  How busy was he? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1057.06s)]
*  Let's just pause in that one because there's so many things to talk about. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1057.86s)]
*  That's what I want to see, though. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1060.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1061.86s)]
*  This fat guy in a golf shirt and a red hat playing golf every day. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1062.18s)]
*  Was he that busy? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1066.98s)]
*  You know that's what the prosecutors are going to do. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1069.22s)]
*  They're going to juxtapose that clip against his schedule of golf literally seven days a week. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1070.8200000000002s)]
*  You had to go through like 60 boxes. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1075.78s)]
*  How long does that take to pull out the shirts? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1077.6200000000001s)]
*  Come on, man. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1079.94s)]
*  Most people go through the boxes of the classified documents before you leave the White House. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1080.8200000000002s)]
*  I'm sorry, I cut you off there. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1083.8600000000001s)]
*  But it's just like that wouldn't have flew in any way. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1085.14s)]
*  Well, it also, as far as we can tell, most of them were marked with big [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1087.7s)]
*  cover sheets that said top secret. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1092.66s)]
*  It seems like it would be quite easy to pull out the vast majority of them pretty quickly. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1094.26s)]
*  Everything he said about it was insane. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1097.3s)]
*  The too busy thing was insane. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1100.02s)]
*  The idea that he basically self-incriminates by being like, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1101.86s)]
*  well, it's mixed in with some golf shirts and some of the... [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1106.74s)]
*  That's how you handle the Iranian war plan as hard-hitting reporter Brett Baer pointed out. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1110.9s)]
*  If his excuses, first, that I was busy when he's not busy. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1117.86s)]
*  Second, that I, oh, I mix it up with all my other golf stuff. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1121.78s)]
*  So I had trouble going through it. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1124.66s)]
*  Well, that's precisely what you're not supposed to do. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1126.26s)]
*  Maybe it was mixed up, Tommy, after the Chinese and Russians came in and photocopied it [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1128.82s)]
*  and sheltered it around. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1132.74s)]
*  Maybe they just put it back in the fucking golf shirts. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1133.54s)]
*  MBS isn't known for being all that careful. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1137.22s)]
*  So maybe you just sort of rifled through it. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1138.82s)]
*  But then you mentioned the Iran war plan piece of this. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1140.26s)]
*  So this next clip is Trump getting asked about why he waved around the secret [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1142.82s)]
*  Iran attack plan during an interview with two journalists writing a book about [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1147.38s)]
*  his former chief of staff, Mark Meadows. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1152.1000000000001s)]
*  And you were recorded saying that you had a document detailing a plan of attack on [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1153.94s)]
*  another country that was prepared by the US military for you when you were president. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1157.7s)]
*  The Iran attack plan. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1161.6200000000001s)]
*  You remember that? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1162.66s)]
*  Ready? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1164.3400000000001s)]
*  You were recording. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1164.8200000000002s)]
*  It wasn't a document. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1165.46s)]
*  I had lots of paper. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1166.74s)]
*  I had copies of newspaper articles. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1168.0200000000002s)]
*  I had copies of magazines. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1170.18s)]
*  I know. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1171.6200000000001s)]
*  This is specifically a quote. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1172.0200000000002s)]
*  You're quoted on the recording saying the document was secret, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1173.5400000000002s)]
*  adding that you could have declassified it while you were president. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1176.66s)]
*  But quote, now I can't. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1179.78s)]
*  You know, this is still secret, highly confidential. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1181.5400000000002s)]
*  And the indictment cites the recording and the testimony from people in the room saying [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1184.5800000000002s)]
*  you showed it to people there that day. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1188.18s)]
*  So you say on this on tape, this is just the opposite that you can't declassify. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1190.42s)]
*  So why have it? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1194.3400000000001s)]
*  When I said when I said that I couldn't declassify it now, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1195.38s)]
*  this because I wasn't president. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1198.9s)]
*  I never made any bones about that. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1200.66s)]
*  When I'm not president, I can't declassify. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1202.66s)]
*  That's what you said. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1205.14s)]
*  You didn't declassify it. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1205.94s)]
*  I said no, no, I said I couldn't. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1207.46s)]
*  I could have declassified it. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1209.38s)]
*  Brett, there was no document. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1211.38s)]
*  That was a massive amount of papers and everything else talking about Iran and other things. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1213.22s)]
*  And it may have been held up or may not. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1219.14s)]
*  But that was not a document. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1221.38s)]
*  I didn't have a document per se. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1222.66s)]
*  A document per se. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1224.5800000000002s)]
*  Jack Smith is going to call as a witness every single person in that room and make them testify. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1225.78s)]
*  I guess he's just trying to win the news cycle day by day. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1233.6200000000001s)]
*  But what does that answer get you? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1236.98s)]
*  Not much of a victory even of the news cycle, Tommy. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1239.7s)]
*  I mean, first of all, can you imagine him on the stand being cross-examined? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1242.1s)]
*  He's flailing around like a wet fish out of water when Brett Baer is asking questions. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1248.26s)]
*  What's he going to do under actual cross-examination under oath? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1256.02s)]
*  It's just this kind of blizzard of lies. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1259.94s)]
*  There's a direct quote of something he said that he by the way doesn't deny he said that. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1264.1s)]
*  He just kind of obfuscates around like there's a bunch of newspaper cluppings. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1269.22s)]
*  Guess what the newspapers don't have? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1273.3s)]
*  They don't have the Iran war plan. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1274.74s)]
*  He also completely basically undercuts his own bizarre declassification defense by saying, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1277.3s)]
*  I wasn't the president. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1284.5s)]
*  I don't have the ability to declassify. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1285.54s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1287.14s)]
*  You couldn't have declassified the Iranian war plan in the first case. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1288.34s)]
*  That's absolutely clear because no one in the US government, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1291.78s)]
*  no one in the Pentagon was aware that the Iran war plan had been declassified. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1294.8999999999999s)]
*  Then he's saying, well, I couldn't declassify anymore. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1299.1399999999999s)]
*  I wasn't president, but it wasn't that document per se. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1301.78s)]
*  It was a newspaper. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1304.02s)]
*  If there's a recording, he's complete toast. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1305.46s)]
*  I don't know listening to that clip how he could possibly defend himself [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1308.26s)]
*  if there really was this recording with this document. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1312.74s)]
*  Presumably, they have both the recording and the document. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1315.46s)]
*  I want to come back just quickly to my favorite hobbyist real quick. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1318.1000000000001s)]
*  Who is the audience for the Mark Meadows biography? [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1321.7s)]
*  It'd be pretty funny if the first president in American history [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1326.5s)]
*  basically goes down because he was giving on the record interviews to [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1329.22s)]
*  some people writing a biography of Mark Meadows. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1333.7s)]
*  Mark Meadows is going to release it online as a PDF or something. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1337.54s)]
*  I don't think anyone's going to read that thing. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1340.5s)]
*  Yeah, seriously. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1341.86s)]
*  You can hear Bret Baier in the interviews. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1343.9399999999998s)]
*  He's like, come on, man. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1345.3s)]
*  Help me help you. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1346.5s)]
*  Do better. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1347.54s)]
*  Anything better. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1349.6999999999998s)]
*  Come on. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1350.26s)]
*  It's Fox News. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1350.58s)]
*  We're trying to help you out here. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1351.2199999999998s)]
*  But Ben, this was probably my favorite part of the whole interview. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1352.1s)]
*  This is Bret Baier quoting some of Trump's former top aides talking about him. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1357.54s)]
*  And just look, we have the best economy we've ever had. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1362.4199999999998s)]
*  The world has ever seen. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1364.82s)]
*  Your vice president, Mike Pence, is running against you. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1366.1799999999998s)]
*  Your ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1368.6599999999999s)]
*  she's running against you. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1370.82s)]
*  Your former secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said he's not supporting you. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1371.62s)]
*  You mentioned national security advisor, John Bolton. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1375.22s)]
*  He's not supporting you either. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1377.78s)]
*  You mentioned Attorney General Bill Barr says you shouldn't be president again. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1379.06s)]
*  I called you the consummate narcissist and troubled man you recently called. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1383.3799999999999s)]
*  And Barr, a gutless pig. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1387.46s)]
*  Your second defense secretary is not supporting you. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1390.4199999999998s)]
*  Called you irresponsible. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1392.98s)]
*  This week, you and your White House called your White House chief of staff, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1394.26s)]
*  John Kelly, weak and ineffective and born with a very small brain. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1397.06s)]
*  You called your acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, a born loser. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1401.86s)]
*  You called your first secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, dumb as a rock. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1405.78s)]
*  And your first defense secretary, James Mattis, the world's most overrated general. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1409.3799999999999s)]
*  You called your White House press secretary, Kayla Kanany, milk toast. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1413.1399999999999s)]
*  And multiple times you've referred to your transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1416.34s)]
*  as Mitch McConnell's China loving wife. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1420.34s)]
*  So why did you hire all of them in the first place? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1423.3s)]
*  Ben, could you imagine if someone interviewed you and they were like, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1427.7s)]
*  okay, Ben, Dennis McDonough said you were the dumbest person he's ever worked with. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1431.94s)]
*  Cody Keenan says he hates your guts and hopes you get hit by a car. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1436.6599999999999s)]
*  Dan Pfeiffer, like that just unloads on the guy. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1440.1s)]
*  Hearing Trump's childish responses, he's like a pig or whatever about Attorney General Barr, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1444.98s)]
*  it's almost somehow worse. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1450.74s)]
*  It makes him look so small. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1451.86s)]
*  It really does. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1453.46s)]
*  It makes you wonder, maybe Brett Baer just decided to become Edward R. Murrow here, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1455.14s)]
*  but it does make you wonder, the Murdochs fell out of... [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1461.14s)]
*  The Foxes continue to get Trump's back, but we know from reporting that the Murdochs [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1465.94s)]
*  aren't big Trump people. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1470.98s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal editorial page that they control has been pretty hard on Trump. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1472.5800000000002s)]
*  I do wonder if that was a shot across the bow. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1476.74s)]
*  This was a succession episode. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1479.46s)]
*  Logan Rory got sick of somebody and tried to elevate somebody. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1481.94s)]
*  That's a space to watch. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1486.18s)]
*  It is pretty jarring to hear that's basically the entire national security team. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1490.1s)]
*  Literally every single member of the national security cabinet, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1496.42s)]
*  except for the biggest hacks like that. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1499.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, like Rick Rennel. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1501.54s)]
*  That has to get through to some people, I think. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1507.3s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1510.26s)]
*  Even Trump people have to be like, well, it's not a bad point. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1511.86s)]
*  When you hear that, you also wonder why don't more people just do that? [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1515.2199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, those are very easy. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1519.62s)]
*  Those are softball. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1520.6599999999999s)]
*  I mean, I guess Brett Baer is much more sitting there thinking, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1521.3799999999999s)]
*  I can't believe he agreed to do this interview. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1523.78s)]
*  By the way, it just came out that Brett Baer is going to moderate [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1525.3s)]
*  the first Republican debate on August 23rd. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1528.58s)]
*  I'm sure he's trying to get his tough journalist, Bonafide, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1531.86s)]
*  back into the discourse after all the embarrassing emails and things [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1535.8600000000001s)]
*  came out about him and the Dominion lawsuit. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1539.14s)]
*  Also, it would be interesting if Trump uses that as an excuse to not do the debates, right? [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1541.94s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1546.42s)]
*  I don't know if you had time to see this, Ben, because I know you're overseas, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1547.7800000000002s)]
*  but right before we started recording, the New York Times published a report about [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1549.7800000000002s)]
*  one of the Trump Middle Eastern business deals. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1554.26s)]
*  This is that real estate golf deal in Oman. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1556.5800000000002s)]
*  We learned in this piece. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1560.8200000000002s)]
*  It's a good piece. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1562.5800000000002s)]
*  It's worth reading. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1563.14s)]
*  Basically, it's an agreement to work with a Saudi company to develop a hotel and golf [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1563.86s)]
*  course in Oman. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1567.3s)]
*  The deal, according to the Times, puts Trump directly in business with the government of Oman [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1568.4199999999998s)]
*  and with this Saudi real estate company that has close ties to the Saudi government and royal family. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1574.34s)]
*  The Times says it was the Saudi firm's idea to bring Trump into this deal. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1580.1799999999998s)]
*  That deal has given us something like $5 million already, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1585.54s)]
*  but will give his family direct management over these properties for 30 years. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1588.4199999999998s)]
*  Of course, also this property is being built up by foreign laborers in unsafe conditions, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1594.1799999999998s)]
*  basically slave labor. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1599.06s)]
*  But imagine running for president again when you are in a joint venture with a Saudi and Omani [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1600.26s)]
*  conglomerate. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1607.06s)]
*  It is something that should just also be illegal. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1609.6999999999998s)]
*  Part of the problem is that that's actually legal, even though it's flagrantly corrupt [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1613.1399999999999s)]
*  and disgusting. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1617.22s)]
*  These are countries that have enormous interests in the United States. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1618.82s)]
*  They're basically paying money into the pocket of someone who's running for president. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1622.34s)]
*  That's the definition of a conflict of interest. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1628.18s)]
*  I would like to see some people in Congress try to legislate around what people who want [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1630.66s)]
*  to be president of the United States can do in terms of... [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1636.1000000000001s)]
*  We did this, by the way, just so people... [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1639.06s)]
*  It's not impossible. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1641.06s)]
*  I know that obviously earlier in people's careers, they're going to do business overseas, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1642.98s)]
*  but there have been regulations around how many years before and after you're in office [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1646.34s)]
*  you can do this kind of business for regular people who aren't president. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1650.8999999999999s)]
*  There should be some limitation on what you can do in this space. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1655.86s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1659.1399999999999s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1659.62s)]
*  So that will be interesting to see how that plays out. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1660.8999999999999s)]
*  Maybe the biggest story of the weekend was Secretary of State Tony Blinken went to China [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1665.62s)]
*  for two days of meetings. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1670.5s)]
*  That had been delayed since the great Chinese spy balloon murder of 2023. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1671.78s)]
*  I'm curious what your read was. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1677.3s)]
*  It seems like it went almost better than expected, or at least incrementally. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1678.82s)]
*  Tony spent a bunch of time with China's top foreign policy official. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1682.26s)]
*  He spent time with the Chinese foreign minister. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1685.86s)]
*  But the most positive sign was I think he got 35 minutes with Chinese President Xi Jinping [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1688.02s)]
*  himself. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1692.74s)]
*  And the vibes and the comments in that Xi meeting were more positive than even the lower level [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1693.54s)]
*  meetings where I think the Chinese kind of aired out more of their grievances and criticisms of [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1698.82s)]
*  export controls and sanctions and policy towards Taiwan. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1703.06s)]
*  Here's a clip of Tony on NPR talking about Taiwan and a little bit about the visit. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1707.14s)]
*  We have real concerns about the direction that this has taken in recent years [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1712.18s)]
*  where China has taken reckless actions. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1717.14s)]
*  We have a fundamental understanding that differences with regard to Taiwan will be [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1721.38s)]
*  resolved peacefully. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1727.3s)]
*  We have a fundamental understanding that neither side will take any unilateral actions that could [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1728.5s)]
*  upset the status quo. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1733.06s)]
*  We reiterated the policy that we followed from administration to administration, Republican [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1735.4599999999998s)]
*  and Democrat alike, of the One China policy. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1740.8999999999999s)]
*  That's not changed. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1744.8999999999999s)]
*  I made that very clear. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1745.78s)]
*  We don't support Taiwan's independence. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1748.4199999999998s)]
*  And again, we oppose unilateral actions by either side that would change the status quo. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1752.1s)]
*  Tony's going back to the original or at least longstanding US policy, not like riffing the [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1758.58s)]
*  way Biden has about whether the US might defend an invasion of Taiwan. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1764.4199999999998s)]
*  But Ben, one interesting rhetorical shift that we did see at these meetings is the US has [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1768.74s)]
*  gone from suggesting that the Chinese government might decide to provide weapons to Russia to use [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1772.58s)]
*  in the war in Ukraine to now they're urging China to remain vigilant to ensure that Chinese [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1777.78s)]
*  companies aren't supporting the Russian war effort. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1783.06s)]
*  And I was wondering if you thought that rhetorical shift was a sign that fears of China getting [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1785.94s)]
*  involved in the war have abated or if this is kind of like a clever way to make the same point in a [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1792.74s)]
*  little bit of a less caustic way. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1799.22s)]
*  I mean, first of all, it does matter that Xi Jinping met with Tony. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1801.54s)]
*  I know this sounds like just diplomatic performance, but there's a real signaling that happens in the [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1804.82s)]
*  US-China relationship between when contacts happen and what level they happen. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1811.54s)]
*  And the fact that Xi Jinping made a point to meet with Tony even for like 35 minutes [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1815.62s)]
*  is then signaling they'd like to move into some de-escalation and some slightly improved set of [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1819.7s)]
*  circumstances. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1824.6599999999999s)]
*  So that actually matters as kind of protocol as it seems. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1825.3799999999999s)]
*  It is telling that the US made that comment. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1832.18s)]
*  I kind of read it as there's been incredible specificities we've talked about in putting [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1835.7s)]
*  out intelligence around what we think is happening in terms of the war in Ukraine. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1841.46s)]
*  Most notably with obviously the pre-war intelligence on Russia, but also on these [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1845.22s)]
*  red flags about China. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1848.98s)]
*  To me, it kind of signals that we believe that there are Chinese entities providing that support. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1850.74s)]
*  So to me, it felt like a signaling of like, hey, here's what we're seeing. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1857.06s)]
*  We know that the government itself may not have a policy of providing this assistance, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1861.14s)]
*  but maybe there are these companies inside China that let's face it, at the end of the day, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1865.78s)]
*  they're all controlled by it. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1870.74s)]
*  No company in China is going to be like, you know what we're going to do today? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1872.6599999999999s)]
*  We're going to like sell arms to Russia or sell military equipment to Russia or sell [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1875.62s)]
*  uniforms for the military to Russia. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1879.86s)]
*  That's not happening about the approval of the Chinese government. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1881.6999999999998s)]
*  So you're right that they were kind of, you know, by putting the onus on like, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1884.02s)]
*  please be vigilant about these companies, it's less of a direct shot at them. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1888.74s)]
*  But I think it is us shining a spotlight as the United States on the fact that like, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1892.98s)]
*  we think this is happening. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1896.82s)]
*  It may not be lethal equipment and maybe other kinds of support. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1899.06s)]
*  And it's a more polite way of trying to compel them to take some steps. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1903.1399999999999s)]
*  The Taiwan point, we love Tony, like, God bless the man, those are the exact talking points. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1906.98s)]
*  They would have been prepared for any US government spokesperson for the last 20 years. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1913.54s)]
*  And so for Tony to read them is actually a message to China, like, hey, we're back on the script. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1919.86s)]
*  You know, we're not looking to pick a fight on this. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1925.3s)]
*  You made the important point, though, which is at some point between now and the election, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1927.3s)]
*  Biden's going to be asked probably more than one time, you've said multiple times that you [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1931.22s)]
*  would like intervene militarily to support Taiwan, which is not actually US policy. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1935.3s)]
*  It'd be interesting to see if Biden sticks to that line or not. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1941.7s)]
*  To me, that's going to be a very notable thing to watch. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1944.26s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1947.86s)]
*  You know, into your point about the Xi Jinping meeting, [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1948.5s)]
*  did you ever watch that god-awful VH1 reality show, the pickup artists? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1951.7s)]
*  I mean, I may have watched an episode or two. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1957.3799999999999s)]
*  You're aware of it. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1959.86s)]
*  So for those who aren't as lame as us, it featured this creepy dude named Mystery. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1960.4199999999998s)]
*  He had terrible facial hair and weird hats. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1965.94s)]
*  And basically, he gave advice to lame guys about how to get girls. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1968.18s)]
*  And it always boiled down to nagging them, which is like being mean to people and making [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1971.86s)]
*  them feel insecure. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1975.22s)]
*  So they like you. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1976.02s)]
*  It's just the worst show ever, the worst advice ever. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1976.58s)]
*  I feel like the Chinese are very good at nagging us. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1978.8999999999999s)]
*  They, like, deny us routine meetings and make getting other routine meetings like this feel [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1981.22s)]
*  like a huge win. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1986.9s)]
*  And I shouldn't say it's it's not necessarily routine for the Chinese president to meet [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1987.7s)]
*  with our secretary of state, but like we should be having conversations up and down. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1992.1000000000001s)]
*  Regardless, I'm with you. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1996.26s)]
*  Like, I'll take it. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1997.22s)]
*  I do think it's good. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1998.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=1999.7s)]
*  The question, I think, I mean, tell me if you agree, Xi and Biden will be in San [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2000.5s)]
*  Francisco in November at the APEC summit. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2005.46s)]
*  Question is whether they get together in person there. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2008.02s)]
*  Hopefully, that's the kind of final piece of this puzzle. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2010.18s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2013.38s)]
*  And I think this is probably meant to kind of tee that up. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2014.18s)]
*  And look, again, this may seem like protocol, but like it's a signal from both sides that [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2017.06s)]
*  they'd like to calm things down. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2022.9s)]
*  They'd like to reestablish channels. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2024.18s)]
*  Usually what happens if the president start meeting again, we talked on previous podcasts [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2026.02s)]
*  about like the military to military channels. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2031.22s)]
*  Usually those resume after the presidents are talking. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2033.7s)]
*  Like it sets a tone that permeates down. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2036.1s)]
*  And also, this is closely watched around the world. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2038.42s)]
*  And most countries don't want the U.S. and China to be as at loggerheads as they have been. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2040.98s)]
*  It'll be received as a positive signal around the world. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2046.74s)]
*  Like, OK, maybe like we can chill out a little bit about how fast things are escalating [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2048.98s)]
*  between the U.S. and China. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2052.98s)]
*  So it'll have market effects. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2054.3399999999997s)]
*  It's actually like a 30-minute meeting that actually matters, which is not always the case. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2057.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2063.14s)]
*  And interesting as I mentioned around the world, I did notice that not Xi Jinping, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2063.94s)]
*  but I think like the number two official in the Chinese system was in Berlin for meetings [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2068.02s)]
*  with Olaf Scholz. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2072.42s)]
*  So it's the first meetings between the Germans and the Chinese, I think for three years, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2073.38s)]
*  mostly for COVID reasons. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2077.86s)]
*  But like it does seem like there's a bit of a thawing happening here between, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2079.3s)]
*  you know, sort of the West and the Chinese leadership. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2083.38s)]
*  Yeah, the Chinese. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2086.34s)]
*  I mean, and look, to be clear about this, I think this is actually partially the Chinese [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2087.1400000000003s)]
*  feeling like they don't have the strongest hand. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2093.1400000000003s)]
*  Like their economy is not coming back from COVID in the same way that they thought it would. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2094.7400000000002s)]
*  Like they, I think they are feeling like, you know, we need to take some of this edge [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2099.06s)]
*  off the relationship a bit too. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2103.7s)]
*  The question is whether this impacts policy, because part of what China doesn't like is [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2105.54s)]
*  the U.S. tightening the squeeze on, you know, denying inputs and investments into the U.S. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2109.7s)]
*  into the Chinese economy. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2114.18s)]

*  Israel. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2382.02s)]
*  A couple months back we did a special episode about the changes that Prime Minister Bibi [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2382.9s)]
*  Netanyahu had proposed to Israel's judicial system and how those changes could undercut [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2386.98s)]
*  democracy itself in Israel. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2391.38s)]
*  If you want to get into more detail, check out the Israel and the brink episode we did [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2392.82s)]
*  in May. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2396.02s)]
*  But here's an update on this process. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2396.82s)]
*  So Netanyahu, in the wake of all these huge protests, like every week in Israel, he suspended [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2398.9s)]
*  efforts to push forward these judicial changes and he started negotiations with the opposition, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2406.1800000000003s)]
*  with the president of the country. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2411.1400000000003s)]
*  To see if there's some sort of compromise I think would end the protests, let some steam [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2412.82s)]
*  off for Bibi politically, but I think ultimately get him what he wants. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2417.2200000000003s)]
*  Those talks unraveled this week after Netanyahu tried to intervene in the current judicial [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2421.7000000000003s)]
*  selection process and see if he could get more judges named from his party and not from [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2427.6200000000003s)]
*  the opposition. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2432.1800000000003s)]
*  That was not a good sign. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2433.06s)]
*  And then on Sunday, then the Israeli cabinet approved a resolution that would shorten the [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2434.98s)]
*  process for approving settlement construction in the West Bank. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2439.7799999999997s)]
*  This resolution gives approval authority for new settlements to a right-wing minister named [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2442.8199999999997s)]
*  Bezalel Smotrich, who was born, raised, and I think currently lives in an illegal settlement. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2448.98s)]
*  Smotrich has also called for Israel to annex the West Bank. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2455.06s)]
*  He doesn't believe there should be a Palestinian state and he once called himself a proud [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2458.4199999999996s)]
*  homophobe. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2462.8999999999996s)]
*  So this is a great leader in the Israeli government right now. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2463.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so yeah, wonderful guy. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2468.1s)]
*  So these changes, it sounds like esoteric, right? [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2470.42s)]
*  But it empowers this far right-wing zealot to get into the settlement process and it pulls [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2473.06s)]
*  back the ability for political leaders to intervene and delay settlement construction. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2481.8599999999997s)]
*  If you let's say the UN or the United States gets mad about it. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2485.14s)]
*  So the government also advanced planning for over 4500 housing units in West Bank settlements [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2488.2599999999998s)]

*  This feels very familiar to UNB Ben because this happened to us on the eve of a Biden visit. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2498.74s)]
*  The Biden administration said is deeply troubled by the news sort of again back to your familiar [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2503.06s)]
*  talking points. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2507.46s)]
*  Troubled or not, there was no talk about consequences and on the contrary, it does seem [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2508.42s)]
*  like there's still this pretty intensive effort going on to broker a normalization agreement [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2512.58s)]
*  between Israel and Saudi Arabia that would involve the US giving tons and tons of stuff [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2516.74s)]
*  in terms of security guarantees and nuclear infrastructure to the Saudis to get Bibi Net [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2522.66s)]
*  Yahu a huge political win as they are de facto annexing the West Bank. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2528.58s)]
*  So it doesn't feel like we're in a very good place there. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2534.3399999999997s)]
*  It doesn't. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2536.5s)]
*  I mean, first of all, this is who these people are. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2537.06s)]
*  This is who this government is. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2539.2999999999997s)]
*  This government believes in a settlement agenda. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2541.94s)]
*  This government believes in the judicial changes that they tried to ram through in the face of [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2544.18s)]
*  public pressure and then pull back. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2548.42s)]
*  Just the fact that they kind of tactically retreated for a little bit after all those [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2550.02s)]
*  protests in Israel doesn't mean that they weren't going to come at these types of issues. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2554.8999999999996s)]
*  And we see them coming back at these kinds of issues. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2557.54s)]
*  This kind of total empowerment of the settler movement to be in charge of settlements is [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2560.3399999999997s)]
*  pretty unsettled message. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2565.9399999999996s)]
*  And to me, and there's been violence we've seen in the West Bank flare up. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2567.7799999999997s)]
*  So nothing changing in terms of treatment of Palestinians as well. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2573.8599999999997s)]
*  And you put your finger on it. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2578.7400000000002s)]
*  Right now, all reports are that there are these intensive discussions with the Saudis [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2581.3s)]
*  around a normalization deal where the most kind of problematic issue, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2587.54s)]
*  and we'd obviously have to see what the terms of the deal are and whether there are other [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2592.98s)]
*  elements that the US negotiates with respect to American interests. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2596.02s)]
*  But basically, the US would be giving a lot of things to Saudi Arabia, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2600.02s)]
*  security guarantees, something in the nuclear space, defense sales, whatever, in exchange for [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2606.6600000000003s)]
*  Saudi Arabia normalizing relations with Israel, which is a huge boon for Israel. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2613.0600000000004s)]
*  The fact that the Netanyahu government, knowing that that's happening, they know that's [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2618.34s)]
*  happening, is just literally like punching the United States in the stomach on the two issues [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2624.34s)]
*  that we constantly raise, which is backsliding on democracy in Israel and [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2630.98s)]
*  treating the Palestinians. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2635.46s)]
*  What does that say about Bibi Netanyahu's respect for the United States of America? [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2637.54s)]
*  Why are we expending? [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2644.02s)]
*  Why would we go to great lengths to provide enormous and difficult things to help Israel [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2645.54s)]
*  and Israeli government that is doing this? [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2653.78s)]
*  You would think that in the context of the US doing something that would be very good for their [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2657.62s)]
*  government and for Bibi's politics, as you say, that they would at least put this on the back burner. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2664.2599999999998s)]
*  I hope that people call this out. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2671.8599999999997s)]
*  This is complete and utter bullshit. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2673.62s)]
*  Of course, we expect it from Bibi, but man, if he's doing this when the US is going to great lengths [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2676.74s)]
*  to try to help him out, what's he going to do on the back end of that? [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2681.54s)]
*  I think it probably speaks to the reality of the deal with the devil he made with this current [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2687.86s)]
*  government coalition where he promised them all these things. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2693.38s)]
*  He promised this smock rich guy who I think recently said that a Palestinian village or [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2696.26s)]
*  town needed to be wiped out like genocidal language. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2703.7000000000003s)]
*  He promised him this role overseeing settlement construction. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2706.42s)]
*  He put all these others of right wing zealots in positions all across the government. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2709.38s)]
*  I wonder even if he wanted to slow some of these trains down, whether it comes to annexation [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2713.06s)]
*  or generally eradicating any hope of a Palestinian state, whether he even could at this point. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2719.14s)]
*  He's definitely like, this is the direction he's gone in. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2728.18s)]
*  This coalition, this particular government, this is the choice Bibi's made. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2731.78s)]
*  I guess the only reason he might be able to rein those people in is if he were communicating to them [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2737.54s)]
*  hey, the US is currently in pretty important discussions with the most important Arab state. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2743.14s)]
*  Maybe we shouldn't be doing this crazy stuff. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2750.26s)]
*  Just as a matter of tactical respect for that process, you'd expect him to show restraint. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2753.46s)]
*  But you're right. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2759.38s)]
*  Like he ultimately, he's the front man for a pretty, [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2760.18s)]
*  like not pretty, very far right collection of characters that will demand that this kind [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2766.5s)]
*  of action on settlements and this kind of action in terms of judiciary. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2772.5s)]
*  So this stuff is not going away. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2775.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2777.78s)]
*  And it's time to, I think, update the policy and the talking points to reflect that reality. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2778.1s)]
*  By the way, someone should go back and do accounting and they can account past [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2782.18s)]
*  administrations who's not seen that kind of like the number of times the US has been deeply concerned [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2786.02s)]
*  about settlement announcements. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2791.38s)]
*  So much concern. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2793.7s)]
*  So much deeply concerned. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2794.74s)]
*  Profoundly. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2797.06s)]
*  We deplore these actions, but won't do anything about them. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2797.86s)]
*  Let's talk Ukraine because, you know, not a ton of new major news there. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2801.46s)]
*  I mean, I think the first thing that's worth just mentioning is that folks are probably, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2806.82s)]
*  if you're waiting for like a day by day or week by week update on the Ukrainian counteroffensive [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2810.26s)]
*  in terms of progress, you probably shouldn't be. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2815.14s)]
*  There's these scattered reports of like Ukrainian troops taking small bits of territory here and [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2817.3s)]
*  there, but this is going to take months and it will be incredibly bloody, which is why it's [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2821.94s)]
*  very annoying when you see the sort of like leading MAGA voices on Twitter saying it's now [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2826.1s)]
*  a fact that the counteroffensive has failed and blah, blah, blah. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2831.62s)]
*  It's like, no, you know, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. kitchen cabinet. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2836.02s)]
*  That's not the case. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2840.2599999999998s)]
*  But it does seem like the Ukrainians are having some success with these behind the [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2841.2999999999997s)]
*  line strikes. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2846.3399999999997s)]
*  Like I think they blew up a Russian ammo depot the other day. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2847.14s)]
*  This could be just them using this new long range British missile, the Storm Shadow missiles that [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2849.86s)]
*  were given to them, or it could be these sort of cross border actions. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2854.42s)]
*  We don't really know. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2858.42s)]
*  Ben, I don't know if you saw this, the New York Times had an interesting piece about [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2859.94s)]
*  how challenging it's been for Ukraine to like get and maintain good weapons. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2862.98s)]
*  They talked about how they spent, I think, $800 million worth of purchases that just [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2867.62s)]
*  were either partially or not at all fulfilled. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2872.82s)]
*  And that 30% of their stuff is under repair at any moment is just sort of like an interesting [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2876.1s)]
*  window into it's not just about getting the stuff from the Western partners, but [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2879.94s)]
*  maintaining it. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2884.18s)]
*  And then I did also see that Putin did a two hour interview with a bunch of Russian military [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2885.22s)]
*  bloggers where he like gotten the weed on tactics and tanks destroyed and production [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2889.7799999999997s)]
*  of new stuff and disputes between the Wagner group and the Russian military. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2894.66s)]
*  But it was just interesting to see him sort of try to pre spin the Ukrainian offensive [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2898.5s)]
*  and do his own little PR thing. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2904.2599999999998s)]
*  Even with these like, you know, 18 military zealots, basically, they call themselves [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2906.98s)]
*  journalists. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2911.94s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's interesting, too, because the place that Putin has faced some pushback, [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2912.74s)]
*  right, because they've shut down all opposition media. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2917.2999999999997s)]
*  But he's kind of from the right and from these kind of military bloggers and these kind of [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2919.9399999999996s)]
*  nationalists, ultra nationalists, telegram channels and the Wagner guys. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2924.02s)]
*  And so to me, it's also kind of interesting that like, that's the audience that Putin [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2928.5s)]
*  needs to speak to, you know, like, he's a little worried about that. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2932.18s)]
*  And he's trying to chill those people out a little bit and look like he's in control. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2935.7s)]
*  Like, he hasn't done much of that. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2938.8199999999997s)]
*  So he must felt the need to get ahead of, you know, and frame the counteroffensive a [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2940.5s)]
*  bit and show that he's actually like invested in this because part of what he's done is [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2945.7s)]
*  just not talk about the war that much, which I have to think if you're Russian and you're [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2949.38s)]
*  seeing the casualties, it's going to start to grate on you that like he can't even [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2953.94s)]
*  acknowledge this. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2958.1s)]
*  He can't even talk to us about this. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2958.74s)]
*  So it's a sign of some amount of pressure he might be feeling. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2961.3s)]
*  But you're right on the counteroffensive. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2964.82s)]
*  I mean, last time, you know, the success that the Ukrainians had around Kharkiv and [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2966.18s)]
*  Khorasan didn't come till the fall, you know, right. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2972.8199999999997s)]
*  And so I think people basically have to realize this is going to be a timeline that plays [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2975.62s)]
*  out till the end of the year. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2979.14s)]
*  But as they do have diminished stockpiles, like you're right, like the incentive for [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2980.4199999999996s)]
*  them to do these kind of behind the lines attacks is going to continue to go up. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2985.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2990.02s)]
*  Well, one of the really interesting Russia piece that I saw was, I guess there's a new [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2990.58s)]
*  book coming out called Spies, the Epic Intelligence War Between East and West. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2994.82s)]
*  This book details what US intelligence believes was a Russian plot to assassinate a defector, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=2998.1800000000003s)]
*  a Russian defector on US soil. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3005.06s)]
*  So the Times excerpted or got a copy of the book and wrote it up. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3006.9s)]
*  So this defector is a guy named Alexander Puttive. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3010.5800000000004s)]
*  He's a former Russian intelligence officer who helped the US uncover the illegals program, [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3014.7400000000002s)]
*  which this happened when you and I were in the White House. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3019.6200000000003s)]
*  Ben, is this sleeper cell network of these like deep cover Russian agents who live sort [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3022.34s)]
*  of normal lives in the US while trying to build contacts with government officials or academics [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3026.5s)]
*  or whatever, whomever might provide them intelligence in the long run wasn't the most [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3031.3s)]
*  successful program, I would say. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3034.7400000000002s)]
*  But the FBI arrested 10 of them in June of 2010 and later expelled them from the country [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3036.26s)]
*  in a prisoner exchange and then also became the show The Americans. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3042.1800000000003s)]
*  That might be the most successful part here. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3045.7000000000003s)]
*  So, you know, Sergei Skripal was one of the people released in that exchange. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3048.34s)]
*  You might have heard of him because he was a Russian military intelligence [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3052.02s)]
*  analyst who was selling secrets to the British, got caught, thrown in prison, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3055.22s)]
*  came out in this release and then the Russians tried to assassinate him while he was living [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3058.5s)]
*  in the UK with a nerve agent. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3062.5s)]
*  So around the same time, Puttive, this other defector that the US had been working with [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3064.74s)]
*  relocated to the Miami area. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3070.98s)]
*  For some reason, he applied for a fishing license and registered to vote under his real name. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3073.46s)]
*  And then that led to the Russians forcing some Mexican doctor they had leverage on to [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3077.86s)]
*  find his car and try to surveil him. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3083.5400000000004s)]
*  That guy got caught, got kind of roughed up in the process, and it led to this sort of [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3086.5800000000004s)]
*  like tit for tat where the US in 2021 imposed sanctions and expelled 10 Russian diplomats, [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3090.1000000000004s)]
*  including their chief of station. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3095.46s)]
*  They responded in kind, etc. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3096.7400000000002s)]
*  But I think the main takeaway then was if Putin is willing to assassinate these people [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3098.6600000000003s)]
*  on British and American soil, I'm not really sure what guardrails exist anymore. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3105.46s)]
*  I guess like assassinating a CIA agent in Moscow would be kind of the next thing there. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3111.06s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we've seen him like the detention of American journalists. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3116.26s)]
*  But this is like stuff that didn't happen in the Cold War. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3122.02s)]
*  That's part of what is so striking about it. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3128.42s)]
*  For all the nuclear brinksmanship and geopolitical competition in the Cold War, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3130.7400000000002s)]
*  the idea of assassinations on each other's territory, there was some respect for [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3134.8199999999997s)]
*  diplomatic niceties. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3141.22s)]
*  And it does beg the question, as to an important point, we expelled these people, but [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3144.18s)]
*  the ability to let the Russian government operate on US soil, obviously they're going [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3148.98s)]
*  to need an embassy, but you could start to see restrictions on how many people can be [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3155.22s)]
*  there and what they can do. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3160.5s)]
*  I mean, they're assassinating people here, as they've done in the United Kingdom. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3161.54s)]
*  I think you have to kind of really look at, can they operate here as a normal foreign [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3166.66s)]
*  governor or soil? [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3170.82s)]
*  And obviously, I'm not saying no diplomatic representation, we need that, we need the [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3171.86s)]
*  ability of conversations, but you can put limits on that. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3174.82s)]
*  And it does strike me that they're just beyond a point of guardrail. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3178.98s)]
*  So they're crossing all these different lines. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3182.9s)]
*  And at a certain point, you have to kind of adjust to that reality. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3186.5s)]
*  I think the US is doing that, by the way. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3189.06s)]
*  But yeah, we've seen them literally assassinating multiple people in Europe and the UK. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3191.22s)]
*  If they start doing that in the United States. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3196.5s)]
*  And there's been some murky reports over the years, there was a guy who turned up dead [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3198.2599999999998s)]
*  in a hotel room in DC a few years ago, and nobody could ever really figure out what happened, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3203.2999999999997s)]
*  was he drunk? [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3208.3399999999997s)]
*  But there was smoke there, but they never found the fire. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3209.54s)]
*  But this does feel like something that could be part of Russia's escalation in general. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3213.22s)]
*  Yeah, it definitely does. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3218.02s)]
*  I mean, also, how are you like a Russian double agent? [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3218.82s)]
*  You get sent to Miami in some secret CIA relocation program and you register to vote under your own name? [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3223.38s)]
*  Like, what are we doing here? [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3229.06s)]
*  I mean, Kerry Russell and Matthew Reese were much better than the Americans. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3230.98s)]
*  I was like, man, if the Russians actually had spies like that, that'd be a big problem. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3235.6200000000003s)]
*  The illegals were that you talked about, those were people like they were like, [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3241.3s)]
*  hanging out in the US and just kind of sending some reports back about what they saw. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3244.42s)]
*  It was not that exciting. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3247.86s)]
*  Yeah, it was not that exciting, although wild a couple weeks for us when we [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3250.34s)]
*  learned about that and rolled it up. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3254.5s)]
*  Two more quick things then we're out of here. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3256.58s)]
*  So the Washington Post, Ben, ran a very depressing report about how Facebook has been slowly [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3258.5s)]
*  agreeing to more and more demands from the Vietnamese government to stifle free speech [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3264.7400000000002s)]
*  and basically silence critics of the government. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3268.9s)]
*  The Post reported that Facebook has, quote, [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3271.2200000000003s)]
*  There's also this graph in the story. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3274.02s)]
*  So Meta has tracked government censorship requests in Vietnam since 2017, [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3282.02s)]
*  according to its own transparency reports. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3285.86s)]
*  As of June 2022, it had blocked more than 8,000 posts in the country, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3287.7000000000003s)]
*  most for allegedly containing content opposing the Communist Party and the government of Vietnam, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3292.1800000000003s)]
*  or information that distorts, slanders or insults organizations or individuals, [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3297.06s)]
*  the report says. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3300.58s)]
*  So they're just taking down tons of stuff. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3301.2200000000003s)]
*  Facebook back in the day used to be an important space for free expression in Vietnam, [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3303.46s)]
*  but now former Facebook employees say the company is basically agreed to far more [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3310.26s)]
*  draconian restrictions on speech than in other countries in the region. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3314.1s)]
*  And this matters because for Facebook, Vietnam is their seventh largest market worldwide. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3318.58s)]
*  And again, the thing to understand here for Vietnamese people is that [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3324.82s)]
*  Facebook isn't just like an app that your grandparents use that you don't anymore. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3328.1800000000003s)]
*  It's like 70% of the roughly 100 million people in Vietnam use Facebook. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3332.18s)]
*  It has huge influence. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3336.98s)]
*  But this increasingly repressive government has worn Facebook down. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3339.2999999999997s)]
*  It sounds like Facebook is no longer really fighting these requests. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3343.62s)]
*  Maybe the staffers who used to work on these issues have been laid off. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3346.66s)]
*  So just very depressing stuff here. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3350.2599999999998s)]
*  Then really the best thing Mark Zuckerberg has going for him is [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3353.54s)]
*  Elon Musk blotting out the sun when it comes to tech reporting, [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3356.58s)]
*  because their Facebook's reach and impact is far greater than Twitter in any of these places. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3360.26s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3364.82s)]
*  Much bigger, much farther. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3365.2200000000003s)]
*  First of all, in Vietnam, like you said, it is massive in Vietnam. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3367.46s)]
*  The interface of the internet in Vietnam is often through Facebook. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3372.1000000000004s)]
*  Right? [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3375.86s)]
*  So it's not just some extra app. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3376.1000000000004s)]
*  It's like people are doing everything on Facebook. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3377.78s)]
*  They're checking the news, they're messaging, they're posting. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3379.6200000000003s)]
*  Keep in mind the next time you hear anything from Facebook about connecting people and the [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3384.98s)]
*  open internet and all the gobblygook and talking points that they use, that's bullshit. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3389.06s)]
*  It's about profit. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3394.1s)]
*  Because it was actually about those things. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3394.9s)]
*  It was actually about connection and openness. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3396.5s)]
*  Then Facebook would not go along with a government trying to control what is on their platform in [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3400.1s)]
*  this way. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3405.38s)]
*  I will say also they have a bit of leverage. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3406.74s)]
*  They're so big in Vietnam. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3410.34s)]
*  They're so big in Vietnam that if the government said, [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3412.18s)]
*  we're taking down all of Facebook in Vietnam, [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3414.82s)]
*  the government would have problems. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3417.7s)]
*  Right? [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3420.26s)]
*  I don't think they could do that given how much people rely on it. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3420.9s)]
*  So like you said, they're not the only bad actor in the tech space. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3423.38s)]
*  Elon Musk is cooperating with all manner of autocratic governments. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3427.22s)]
*  But this is another one to bear in mind the next time you hear the Facebook PR campaign on this stuff. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3430.5s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3438.42s)]
*  I mean, I think what the Vietnamese government figured out is these guys won't draw any lines. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3439.14s)]
*  So you can just keep pushing them and pushing and pushing them back. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3443.94s)]
*  To your point, the story notes that Google takes down lots of stuff on YouTube and in other places. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3446.98s)]
*  Facebook's not alone here and sort of making these censorship requests, [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3453.94s)]
*  but they're just kind of seemingly acquiescing. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3456.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3458.82s)]
*  But that's an important point. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3459.86s)]
*  I wish they realized that they don't have to do this stuff. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3463.46s)]
*  There are other ways of approaching it. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3468.1s)]
*  Yeah, just try. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3469.86s)]
*  Final thing. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3471.22s)]
*  Ben, it's a tough week for former Tory party prime ministers. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3471.86s)]
*  You talked to Boris about Boris's resignation, [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3477.94s)]
*  Boris Johnson's resignation from parliament last week with David Lammy. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3480.02s)]
*  But since then, the report on Johnson's partying during COVID came out and it's just like scathing. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3483.1400000000003s)]
*  106 pages. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3490.02s)]
*  It's written by a seven member committee from parliament, some conservative, some Labour, [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3491.1400000000003s)]
*  one Scottish national party. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3496.5s)]
*  In summary, it says Boris repeatedly lied to parliament about following COVID rules at number 10. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3498.34s)]
*  And then he lied again when he told investigators that he thought his original lies were true. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3503.6200000000003s)]
*  And then he deliberately tried to mislead the investigative committee in all kinds of ways. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3508.82s)]
*  And then finally, they basically gave him a look at this report as a courtesy before its release. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3513.1400000000003s)]
*  He wrote that pissy letter that you talked about with Lammy resigned from parliament [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3517.7000000000003s)]
*  and attacked the committee called like a kangaroo court. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3521.06s)]
*  So the committee was going to recommend suspending from parliament for 90 days. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3524.58s)]
*  I'm sorry, they were going to recommend suspending him from parliament for 10 days, [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3528.82s)]
*  but bumped it to 90 days, which is just an unheard of ban. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3531.94s)]
*  So basically now you're at a point where the only people defending Boris [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3535.54s)]
*  are the people he did favors for, like giving them knighthoods and other honorary titles. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3538.98s)]
*  There's a petition I just saw demanding that current Tory Prime Minister Rishi Sunak [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3543.7000000000003s)]
*  block all those special favors, all the peerages that Boris gave out at the end of his tenure. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3548.98s)]
*  So disaster for him. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3554.7400000000002s)]
*  And then speaking of disasters, Liz Trusts, the other former Tory Prime Minister was asked [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3556.18s)]
*  recently in an interview about the live stream that compared her 44 day tenure as prime minister [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3562.1s)]
*  to a rotting head of cabbage. And she said, quote, I don't think it was particularly funny. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3568.1s)]
*  I think it's pure aisle. So there you go, Ben, beg to differ Liz. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3572.98s)]
*  Pure aisle. I mean, actually the whole world thought it was pretty funny. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3578.74s)]
*  It's pretty funny. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3582.3399999999997s)]
*  It was objectively funny. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3583.3799999999997s)]
*  I have to say. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3584.58s)]
*  It was a very funny. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3585.22s)]
*  Yeah, it was very funny. And like the Boris thing, like on the one hand, [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3586.5s)]
*  it's nice to see that like, apparently, like, you know, there are real consequences for lying. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3593.62s)]
*  Like, can you imagine if Congress could be like suspended for lying? [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3597.86s)]
*  I know, incredible. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3601.7s)]
*  They'd be handing down suspensions like, you know, Draymond Green playoff games or something. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3603.54s)]
*  But like the crazy thing, though, is like Boris isn't done, you know, talking to Lammy, [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3610.42s)]
*  like the idea of him just kind of taking the hit here, like pulling back, [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3616.58s)]
*  letting Rishi lose the next election and then coming back as like he's never going to go away. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3622.1s)]
*  But like, this is about as damning as it gets. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3627.06s)]
*  And like, you could just sense the frustration in this report, because also, like he lied. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3629.14s)]
*  He did something stupid. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3633.7000000000003s)]
*  And it's the Trumpian thing he did is like he would not admit it. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3635.38s)]
*  It was like the Brett Barron of you like, he just been like, you know what, [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3638.82s)]
*  like, we made a mistake, we shouldn't have this party, but like people are stressed out. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3641.78s)]
*  I actually think, like, you know, he wouldn't be prime minister, but people have been like, [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3645.6200000000003s)]
*  well, okay, you know, like the fact that he like, refuses to acknowledge that things happened that [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3649.94s)]
*  factually happened is what is so pathological about this guy and kind of dangerous because like, [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3655.94s)]
*  if you're that crazy that people are like, you do this, we have this evidence, we have this report, [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3661.54s)]
*  and you're like, can't record, you know, this is bullshit. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3665.7s)]
*  Like, this is what people are sick of. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3668.02s)]
*  Yeah, he won't admit he won't give an inch on anything. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3670.02s)]
*  And a lot of the stuff is coming out at the same time that the COVID inquiry that the Brits are [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3673.06s)]
*  doing about sort of like lessons learned how to make sure this doesn't happen again is coming out. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3678.58s)]
*  And you're hearing these like, gut wrenching stories from doctors and families who couldn't [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3682.8199999999997s)]
*  go to funerals or couldn't be with loved ones. And you're like, juxtaposing that with videos [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3687.8599999999997s)]
*  of Boris's staff, you know, fucking around and drinking and dancing at number 10, [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3692.02s)]
*  as they were putting in place all these rules. And it's just like, yeah, [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3697.78s)]
*  inexcusable. Yeah, one rule for everybody else. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3700.34s)]
*  And one set of rules for us and then no accountability for us. I mean, it's exactly [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3703.14s)]
*  what people hate about politics. Exactly. Exactly. Okay, that is it for us. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3706.9s)]
*  Apologies if anyone heard crying babies or lawnmowers or anything else in this room. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3712.02s)]
*  It's we're doing this from home today, but appreciate you guys listening. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3717.7s)]
*  And I think we're back in the studio next week, right, Ben? [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3721.14s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. No, I'm back from like whatever country I'm in. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3723.46s)]
*  Yeah, I was gonna say like, what? Yeah, am I home tomorrow? I think I'm home next week. Anyway, [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3727.46s)]
*  it'll be great. Talk to you guys next week. See you. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpTqu8zVYzg&t=3732.5s)]
