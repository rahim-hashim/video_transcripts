# Israel Launches Ground Invasion of Lebanon and Iran Attacks Israel With Missiles
**Pod Save the World:** [October 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg)
*  Welcome to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Ben Rhodes. Ben is still in New York. Both of us are [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=0.0s)]
*  trying to catch up with the news cycle today. A lot going on, Ben. You know, there's a VP debate [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=7.2s)]
*  tonight, so just a nice little wrinkle there. Imagine you're doing debate prep, you're Tim [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=10.64s)]
*  Walls, and there's a massive Iranian attack on Israel. I'm sure that's a fun little wrinkle. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=14.64s)]
*  I was thinking about that today with the feeling of dread on behalf of that [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  team, right? Because I'm sure you had prepped like that, like some opening joke and some value [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=25.12s)]
*  statement about the middle class or something. That's not, it's probably not going to be the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=30.48s)]
*  opener of the debate. Drag back into the Middle East. Well, it made a lot of changes for us. We [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=35.28s)]
*  had a whole show prepped with a range of topics from Austrian elections to Japanese Prime Minister, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=39.52s)]
*  but instead we're going to focus all of the show today on what's going on in the Middle East, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=44.96s)]
*  specifically between Israel and Hezbollah. So we're going to start with this Iranian ballistic [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=50.88s)]
*  missile attack on Israel, the events that got us to today, including the assassination of Hezbollah [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=55.84s)]
*  leader Hassan Nasrallah. We're talking about the IDF's ground invasion, and then we'll get into [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=60.88s)]
*  Biden's policy on all of this and the response, as well as what the Trump campaign and Trump himself [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=66.0s)]
*  has been saying and how this second front of the war in Gaza is getting folded into the presidential [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=72.64s)]
*  campaign. So fun stuff then. Yeah. Really glad that this is what we're talking about in October. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=79.84s)]
*  Yeah. Bibi Netanyahu's October surprise. And then I talk with Laila Milana Allen. She's special [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  correspondent for PBS NewsHour and currently based in Beirut. We just talk about what it's been like [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  in Lebanon for the last couple of weeks, just how little infrastructure there is for people to [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=98.4s)]
*  protect themselves from missile strikes or for the million plus displaced people who have got [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=103.44s)]
*  pushed out of their homes in southern Lebanon and are trying to figure out where to go [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=110.48s)]
*  and doing so with a government that can barely function, let alone provide them services. So [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=114.08000000000001s)]
*  we'll dig into all that too. So you'll definitely want to hear that conversation. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  I don't sleep on the news hour, by the way. Great show. Excellent show. All right, Ben. So [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=122.72000000000001s)]
*  we'll just start at the top here. So I think it's worth just saying clearly that US efforts to [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=128.24s)]
*  prevent the war in Gaza from spiraling into a broader regional war have failed catastrophically. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  Last week, the Israeli military launched an airstrike into Lebanon that killed Hassan Nasrallah, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  the leader of Hezbollah since 1992. Nasrallah's predecessor was also killed in Israeli airstrike, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  little fun parts of the world. Fact for you, Ben. The New York Times reported that 80 bombs were [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  used in the strike on Nasrallah and CNN said that included at least 15 US-made 2000 pound bombs. So [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  we're definitely funding this war as well. The Nasrallah strike was just, it was just the latest [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=161.20000000000002s)]
*  part of about two weeks of Israeli airstrikes against Hezbollah targets that have reportedly [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=168.0s)]
*  killed over a thousand people, which is roughly the equivalent to the number of casualties [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=172.0s)]
*  on the Lebanese side during the 34 day 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=176.64s)]
*  And then earlier this week, Israel announced a ground invasion into Lebanon. The IDF described [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=181.76s)]
*  the ground invasion as limited localized and targeted ground raids, which is the last time [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=186.64s)]
*  I will ever be regurgitating those ridiculous euphemisms because unfortunately when you start [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=191.44s)]
*  a war, you don't get to really control whether it's limited or not. But that brings us to today, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=196.24s)]
*  Ben. I'm surprised you didn't call this special military operation time. Yeah, it's very Putin [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=201.60000000000002s)]
*  like. That all brings us up to today when Iran launched about 200 ballistic missiles at Israel. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=205.04000000000002s)]
*  Iran says they targeted military and security locations. Here's a clip of White House national [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=212.72s)]
*  security advisor Jake Sullivan commenting on the Iranian attack at the White House briefing earlier. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=217.52s)]
*  Today, Iran launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles towards targets in Israel. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=222.56s)]
*  The United States military coordinated closely with the Israeli defense forces [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=227.2s)]
*  to help defend Israel against this attack. US naval destroyers joined Israeli air defense units [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=232.0s)]
*  in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles. President Biden and Vice President [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=238.96s)]
*  Harris monitored the attack and the response from the White House situation room, joined in person [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=244.88s)]
*  and remotely by their national security team. We are still working with the IDF and the authorities [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=250.72s)]
*  in Israel to assess the impact of the attack. But at this time, and I stress at this time, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=256.47999999999996s)]
*  we do not know of any deaths in Israel. We are tracking the reported death of a Palestinian [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=263.03999999999996s)]
*  civilian in Jericho in the West Bank. We do not know of any damage to aircraft or strategic military [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=268.4s)]
*  assets in Israel. In short, based on what we know at this point, this attack appears to have been [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=275.6s)]
*  defeated and ineffective. So Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, IRGC, said the missiles [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=282.16s)]
*  were launched in retaliation for the assassination of Nasrallah, an IRGC leader who was with him at [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=288.56s)]
*  the time of that airstrike, and for Israel's assassination of Ismail Haniya in Tehran back in [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  July. So Ben, the Israeli government says, you know, they're basically escalating this front [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=298.96000000000004s)]
*  against Hezbollah because Hezbollah has fired over 11,000 rockets or other projectiles into Israel [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=304.64s)]
*  since October 7th of last year, which meant that tens of thousands of Israelis were displaced from [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=310.08s)]
*  their homes in northern Israel. The Israeli policy was described in the media as de-escalation [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=314.71999999999997s)]
*  through escalation. We should note that Israel has already vowed to retaliate against Iran for this [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=320.08s)]
*  latest airstrike or series of missile strikes. So we're not seeing a lot of success here on the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=326.4s)]
*  de-escalation front. But I do think you're starting to see people wonder whether Israel has achieved [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=331.28s)]
*  such overwhelming superiority when it comes to its military, its intelligence community, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=336.88s)]
*  and its missile defense systems, that the balance of power has just fundamentally shifted. And I [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=341.35999999999996s)]
*  wonder if you have thoughts on that. Yeah, I mean, clearly there are a number of things [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=346.08s)]
*  that are on display in terms of Israel's military advantages. Number one, they have this incredible [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=352.4s)]
*  intelligence capability to penetrate, particularly Hezbollah. I mean, we've talked about this, but the [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=360.24s)]
*  ability to locate Nasrallah, who they've been trying to kill for a very long time, and basically [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=366.08s)]
*  the kind of org chart of Hezbollah's leadership, as well as to have pretty good information on [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=372.64s)]
*  what Iranian intentions are, that is an advantage that they are clearly pressing. That's the first [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=378.16s)]
*  one. Then the second one is they have all these US bombs, right? And these are American bombs, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=384.8s)]
*  right? So bunker busters, 2000 pound bombs. We've been an open spigot of weapons to Israel, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=390.8s)]
*  particularly since October 7th. I mean, there's always been an open spigot, but it's widened [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=398.24s)]
*  since October 7th. So they have tremendous offensive capabilities relative to certainly Hezbollah, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=403.12s)]
*  and certainly to a lesser extent, but also to Iran. And then they have this air defense system [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=409.68s)]
*  that also benefits significantly from US coordination and, as Jake Sullivan said, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=416.56s)]
*  sometimes direct US participation in air defense kind of system. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=421.68s)]
*  06 Yeah, the Pentagon said the US fired about a dozen interceptor missiles at Iranian missiles [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=425.2s)]
*  today. So we were a part of both this effort, this missile defense effort, but also the April 1, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=430.08s)]
*  then included a number of Arab countries like the Saudis. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=435.2s)]
*  07 Yeah. And so they have this capacity to target who they want to kill, to overwhelm [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=438.15999999999997s)]
*  adversaries with significant amounts of US supplied offensive weaponry, and to work with the US to [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=449.12s)]
*  have this kind of air defense system that it's like an iron dome over Israel, not just a kind [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=455.44s)]
*  of more limited, named iron dome systems, but even more advanced missile defense systems. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=462.24s)]
*  And that just gives them this huge advantage to press across the region. I would beware [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=468.56s)]
*  of that leading to kind of a degree of triumphalism here. Before we even get into things [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=476.32s)]
*  like civilian deaths, Hezbollah is still there. And they're degraded, but they're fighters there. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=481.92s)]
*  The Palestinian people are still there. The Islamic Republic of Iran is still there. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=492.72s)]
*  Iran was never as 10 feet tall as people were saying at times with this axis of resistance, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=499.04s)]
*  but nor are they this kind of paper tiger. I think people have this habit of overreacting [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=504.64s)]
*  to the thing that just happened in the Middle East, when the one constant is the cycle of [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=510.32s)]
*  violence that just continues and continues. And I think what is happening now is Israel is going on [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=515.44s)]
*  offense against everybody in the region, essentially, that they have like a beef with [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=521.84s)]
*  in this kind of window of time. And they're taking out as many people and as much infrastructure as [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=527.6s)]
*  they can. But there will be other attacks. There will be terrorist attacks. There will be populations [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=533.6s)]
*  that are further inflamed against Israel. There's been a diplomatic cost already. The Saudi [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=539.76s)]
*  normalization plan that they said they wanted is dead. The Iranians still have a nuclear program. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=547.2s)]
*  That may become a greater issue in the coming weeks if Iran decides that maybe they need that [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=554.1600000000001s)]
*  as a deterrent. So they have this advantage that has changed the security dimension and [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=558.48s)]
*  landscape in the region. But I don't know, we had a huge advantage when we invaded and occupied Iraq, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=565.5200000000001s)]
*  Tommy. And it looked great when the statue fell in Baghdad. But something tells me that this [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=570.8s)]
*  isn't leading anywhere good. You get an important lesson there of Iraq and Afghanistan, which is [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=578.88s)]
*  like the US military or the Israeli military can win every single tactical engagement, but that's [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=584.0s)]
*  not necessarily a strategic victory. But you're right. There's these bigger picture questions, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=589.92s)]
*  which is like Hezbollah's leadership seems to have been decimated. How long will it take them to [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=595.1999999999999s)]
*  reconstitute it? And how much will that slow down the organization in the meantime? How much are [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=599.2s)]
*  their ties with Iran weakened? Because Nasrallah was a real key link there. There's reports of some [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=606.0s)]
*  Hezbollah supporters in Lebanon that were upset with Iran. Are those ties fraying at a deeper level? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=612.32s)]
*  Are there other factions in Lebanon that might decide, okay, now Hezbollah is weakened, maybe we [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=618.96s)]
*  should move on them. That could lead to a civil war. And then I think the scariest questions are [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=623.9200000000001s)]
*  the two you just hit on, which is one, will Iran look at Hezbollah being weakened and say, okay, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=628.72s)]
*  my kind of like axis of resistance, proxy force deterrent strategy is not working. Now we need to [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=634.4s)]
*  turn to producing a nuclear weapon. And second, how much will Bibi Netanyahu decide now is my [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=640.5600000000001s)]
*  moment to press the advantage against Iran? And to your point about triumphalism then, I mean, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=647.84s)]
*  Netanyahu released this bizarre clip on social media on Monday in English, by the way, there was [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=653.6s)]
*  kind of a message to Iran that seemed to taunt Iran. Here's a little excerpt of that. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=659.36s)]
*  There is nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach. There's nowhere we will not go to protect [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=664.3199999999999s)]
*  our people and protect our country. With every passing moment, the regime is bringing you, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=670.3199999999999s)]
*  the noble Persian people closer to the abyss. Iran's tyrants don't care about your future, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=676.64s)]
*  but you do. When Iran is finally free, and that moment will come a lot sooner than people think, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=684.56s)]
*  everything will be different. Our two ancient peoples, the Jewish people, and the Persian [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=691.52s)]
*  people will finally be at peace. Our two countries, Israel and Iran, will be at peace. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=696.96s)]
*  Ben, you think he's the best messenger there for the liberation of the Iranian people? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=703.76s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, who is the audience for that actually? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=707.76s)]
*  The US Congress. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=711.12s)]
*  The audience for that message, yes. The audience for that message is in the United States of [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=711.52s)]
*  America. It's like to Iran hawks in the United States. It's not like Iranians are huddled around [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=716.4s)]
*  the radio waiting for the message from Bibi Netanyahu to instigate regime change. And I just [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=720.96s)]
*  caution people again, look at the commentators that are kind of the most triumphalist about this. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=728.96s)]
*  It's an overlapping Venn diagram, to use a Kamala Harris term, to the same people that were the [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=736.5600000000001s)]
*  most triumphalist about the Iraq war. And this is not to say that somehow Iran is winning anything. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=742.5600000000001s)]
*  They're not. They're a corrupt regime that is loathed by probably a majority of their people [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=750.4000000000001s)]
*  that have an 80-something-year-old supreme leader who's ailing and incapable of acting decisively. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=756.9599999999999s)]
*  So it's not to suggest that there's anything but trouble on the horizon for the Iranian regime. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=765.8399999999999s)]
*  But the idea that that is inherently going to lead to some Middle East in which all our problems go [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=771.04s)]
*  away. There are a couple of scenarios you worry about. One is a nuclear one. The other is just a [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=779.2s)]
*  return. What we've seen in the past, and Iraq is a good example of this too, but so have been a [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=788.4000000000001s)]
*  number of conflicts in the Middle East, the more the conventional advantage is on display, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=794.1600000000001s)]
*  there's a return to terrorism and asymmetric attacks. And people have long memories in the [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=800.6400000000001s)]
*  Middle East. And so things might not happen for three months or six months or a year. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=808.56s)]
*  October 7th was probably years in the making. And I only say this to just to, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=815.4399999999999s)]
*  I don't think there's a military solution to all these problems is the core point here. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=821.68s)]
*  And we can get into what some of the, and look, maybe I'll be wrong and Israel will conquer [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=827.28s)]
*  everybody and everyone will move on and there'll be a future of a new Middle East here. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=835.04s)]
*  What I'm concerned about is, okay, what's happening in Lebanon? Does it descend into [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=843.1999999999999s)]
*  kind of chaos and some kind of, like you said, civil war? And we've seen how those go in Lebanon. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=847.4399999999999s)]
*  It's not good for anybody above all the Lebanese people. What happens inside of Iran? Do they go [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=853.52s)]
*  nuclear? Do they, by the way, even if they implode, that's messy and the IRGC is the [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=859.2s)]
*  strongest military force in Iran. So I don't know that there's like people coming over the mountain [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=865.84s)]
*  on white horses here in the coming weeks to turn, to kind of transform Iran. That would be messy [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=870.6400000000001s)]
*  too. What happens in Yemen where the Houthis are dug in and live there and aren't going anywhere? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=877.2800000000001s)]
*  What happens in Iraq where there are proxies that have been close to Hizballah and that have shown [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=882.5600000000001s)]
*  in the past their capacity to threaten US diplomatic facilities? The reason Lebanon has [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=887.84s)]
*  been such a focus of attention from the administration is I think everybody knew that [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=895.9200000000001s)]
*  Lebanon was a thing that could set off like a chain reaction across the region because everybody [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=899.84s)]
*  has interests there. Iran has a lot of interests there, but even the Arab states are not exactly [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=904.64s)]
*  welcoming this Israeli invasion even if they have no love for Hassan Nasrallah because they know how [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=911.52s)]
*  bloody a civil war or war in Lebanon can get. And so there's just a lot of open questions. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=918.08s)]
*  And I think the challenge, yes, the Israeli defense forces have struck huge blows in the [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=926.48s)]
*  last couple of weeks, but what is the political strategy? What is the horizon with the Palestinians? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=934.72s)]
*  What is their future view of Lebanon? Where does this all end with the Iranians? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=940.64s)]
*  And I guess they keep saying escalate to de-escalate, but right now all we're seeing [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=946.48s)]
*  is escalation. And it's just a pretty dangerous game to play and we'll see where it leads. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=951.12s)]
*  And to your point about how a lot of the problems that existed before this second front with [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=959.9200000000001s)]
*  Hizballah blew up are still there. I mean, there was a terror attack today south of Tel Aviv where [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=964.5600000000001s)]
*  seven people were killed and many more were wounded. Palestinian Islamic Jihad took credit [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=969.84s)]
*  for it. And Reuters reported that an IDF airstrike in Gaza killed 37 people. So that's [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=974.32s)]
*  very much an ongoing, very bloody war with a huge civilian toll. But let's talk for a minute about [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=979.2s)]
*  Hassan Nasrallah and what it means to lose him and just some background on Hizballah for folks who [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=984.8000000000001s)]
*  have not heard us talk about it before. So Hizballah, the organization was founded in the early 1980s [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=989.0400000000001s)]
*  in response to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. It went from sort of a loose affiliation of Shia [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=994.08s)]
*  militia groups to this one entity whose objective, state objective, was to push Israel out of Lebanon [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=998.88s)]
*  and just generally resist Western influence, especially from the United States. From the [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1004.48s)]
*  beginning though, Hizballah received support and direction from Iran. And today Hizballah is one [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1009.36s)]
*  of the key proxy forces that Iran uses to conduct terrorist attacks, push back its enemies and try [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1015.52s)]
*  to deter attacks on Iran itself. There was a 2019 State Department report that said Iran provides [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1020.96s)]
*  Hizballah with about $700 million per year in financial backing. So a lot of support within [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1026.8s)]
*  Lebanon itself. Hizballah has evolved and metastasized over time. In 1992, they decided [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1031.44s)]
*  to participate in elections. And today there's a number of Hizballah members in parliament, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1036.8799999999999s)]
*  though their influence is far greater than just that number of elected officials. And as we've [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1040.3999999999999s)]
*  discussed previously, Hizballah runs a network of social services in Lebanon. They do, they run [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1045.36s)]
*  schools, charities, hospitals, media outlets. And Hizballah also has a web abroad. They've got [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1051.52s)]
*  cells and kind of mini criminal enterprises all over the world. In 1994, Hizballah bombed a Jewish [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1059.36s)]
*  community center in Argentina. Last year, two men with ties to Hizballah were arrested in Brazil for [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1064.4s)]
*  plotting to attack Jewish targets, so a very active threat. And then there have been some [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1069.52s)]
*  Hizballah operatives arrested in the U.S. for doing things like selling cigarettes, like criminal [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1073.6s)]
*  schemes. But then those profits get sent back to Lebanon. So they're just, they're all over the [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1078.72s)]
*  place is kind of the point here. And the Financial Times reported that an Iranian official said that [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1083.84s)]
*  Iran's supreme leader thought of Nasrallah as a son, which I think goes a long way towards explaining [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1089.76s)]
*  the ballistic missile strike we saw today. But as you noted earlier, Ben, I mean, unfortunately for [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1095.6000000000001s)]
*  Nasrallah, Israel has spent decades now refocusing its intelligence community on Hizballah [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1101.92s)]
*  and they clearly figured out a way to locate the guy which led to this strike last week. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1108.24s)]
*  So Ben, I'll just pause there. I mean, we've seen a lot of, you know, terrorist leaders come and go [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1112.48s)]
*  from various organizations over the years, right? It was like a running joke that the al-Qaeda [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1118.96s)]
*  number two was the most dangerous job in the world. And, you know, there's always chatter that so and [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1122.64s)]
*  so terrorist leader was irreplaceable. And then lo and behold, groups managed to replace them. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1127.1200000000001s)]
*  What do you think is the impact of Nasrallah's death on Hizballah and its ability to continue [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1132.16s)]
*  doing what it's doing and also coordinate with Iran? Yeah, I was thinking, Tommy, that I, you [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1138.64s)]
*  know, some of the speculation about who'd be the successor. I'm not sure that I'd be rushing to [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1143.6000000000001s)]
*  try to take the job of leader of Hizballah these days, you know? But I think it's, look, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1148.5600000000002s)]
*  it's really important. He was a kind of singular figure in a similar way that Qasem Soleimani was [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1154.64s)]
*  for the IRGC, who was assassinated by the United States and the Trump administration, in that, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1160.8s)]
*  first of all, he took over in 1992 after Israel killed his predecessor, which, by the way, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1166.96s)]
*  as a reminder, you know, Nasrallah proved to be a more effective leader than his predecessor. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1172.08s)]
*  I'm sure they thought it was a big blow when they killed, you know, that guy. But what Nasrallah was [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1178.08s)]
*  able to do is he was able to turn Hizballah, which already was like a political force and a [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1183.2s)]
*  potent kind of terrorist and resistance organization, he really built it into this [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1189.3600000000001s)]
*  kind of multifaceted, multi-dimensional enterprise that had like a strong political wing that was the [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1193.6000000000001s)]
*  dominant faction in Lebanese politics, that had these connective ties to not just Iranians, but [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1200.48s)]
*  all these other resistance groups, you know, fighting with the Assad regime in Syria and [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1207.2s)]
*  supporting militias in Iraq, and they had connective tissue to the Houthis, these kind of [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1212.0s)]
*  criminal enterprises, you know, where they were able to generate revenue for things that they [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1217.68s)]
*  were doing. Ideological appeal that was, I mean, you know, the thing about Hizballah is they're [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1221.6000000000001s)]
*  a little different. I mean, people shouldn't equate them with al-Qaeda, and I don't say this to kind of [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1229.52s)]
*  make them out to be, you know, good guys in any way, shape or form, but, you know, they didn't, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1233.76s)]
*  they condemned the 9-11 attacks, you know, they don't enforce the kind of strident [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1238.96s)]
*  restrictions on women that, you know, even the Iranian regime does because in Lebanon that [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1246.32s)]
*  doesn't fly as well. Again, I'm not saying that to show that these guys engage in acts of terrorism. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1250.4s)]
*  I'm saying that it was a kind of unique organization that could fill a lot of different [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1256.0s)]
*  spaces, you know, terrorist spaces, militia spaces, political spaces, economic spaces, you know, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1260.72s)]
*  kind of global, anti-colonial resistance spaces, and that all kind of emanated from Nasrallah's [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1267.68s)]
*  vision and he had this kind of interesting charisma to him. So it's a huge blow, and when [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1273.92s)]
*  you take him out along with kind of this whole leadership cohort that he built, it's just not [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1280.96s)]
*  the same organization anymore. That said, there are still like tens of thousands of Hizballah [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1286.5600000000002s)]
*  fighters, and there's still Hizballah operatives all around the world, and they're still going [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1293.44s)]
*  to probably regenerate into something else. So to me, I don't think there'll be another Nasrallah, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1300.4s)]
*  and I don't think Hizballah will continue to be what it was, but there'll be something. There [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1304.8000000000002s)]
*  will be a resistance organization that is probably called Hizballah that will continue to be active. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1308.5600000000002s)]
*  I think the questions are, are they going to have to take time to regenerate? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1314.96s)]
*  They have a lot of enemies in Lebanon too. It's not just Israel that doesn't like Hizballah. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1319.6000000000001s)]
*  A lot of people think, you know, as Kim Gattas said last week, they had blood on their hands [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1325.44s)]
*  from the assassination of Rafiq Hariri, a very popular Lebanese prime minister in the early 2000s. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1329.52s)]
*  So there could be internal conflicts in Hizballah, internal conflicts within Lebanon. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1334.6399999999999s)]
*  Yes, to some extent, that's certainly an opportunity for Israel, but it's also a [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1342.8s)]
*  possibility that that gets very bloody. Sometimes what regenerates out of [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1345.76s)]
*  organizations like that is something more extreme. That's your fear, is it that they're [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1351.52s)]
*  even more extremist in the same way that ISIS was more extreme than previous iterations of [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1357.76s)]
*  terrorists in the Middle East. That's what you don't want. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1363.92s)]
*  Yeah. There's been some interesting reporting too, Ben, on how Israel figured out where Nasrallah was [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1366.16s)]
*  and sort of like built this intelligence capability. And one interesting anecdote in this [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1373.68s)]
*  financial time story that went deep on this was they said that Hizballah's decision to deploy [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1378.24s)]
*  fighters into Syria created a huge opening for the Mossad to track them because you had suddenly [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1383.12s)]
*  you had these Hizballah guys traveling to and from Syria. You had all this communications back and [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1389.28s)]
*  forth between Lebanon and Syria that was being monitored, especially calls with like Russian [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1393.9199999999998s)]
*  or Syrian intelligence operatives. And then the Mossad was able to basically read newspaper [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1399.4399999999998s)]
*  obituaries for fighters and then figure out, okay, who is posting on social media about these guys? [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1405.6799999999998s)]
*  And thus were their colleagues who is attending these funerals. And then when they would identify [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1411.12s)]
*  an operative, they would study their pattern of life. They might tap the person's spouse's cell [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1415.6799999999998s)]
*  phone. They got into the car's odometer, just like decades worth of painstaking detailed intelligence [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1420.8s)]
*  work that they clearly just did not do against Hamas. But that I think led to this pretty quick [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1428.56s)]
*  unraveling of Hizballah's senior leadership in the last two weeks. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1436.32s)]
*  That tracks, Tommy. And without revealing anything from when I was in government, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1440.48s)]
*  what I will say is to the point about how they expose themselves because of Syria, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1446.8s)]
*  you'll recall that increasingly in the Obama years, just to take publicly available information, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1451.52s)]
*  Israel started hitting Hizballah weapons shipments in Syria and in other parts of the region. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1457.52s)]
*  It was very apparent that they were beginning to get inside that network and understand how [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1465.1200000000001s)]
*  it operated and were mapping it. And that these guys were getting sloppy and they were getting a [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1468.64s)]
*  little triumphalist because of how Syria went down. And I think that's why the IDF and the [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1475.44s)]
*  Mossad clearly had a plan on the shelf here. Some people might ask, how come they're doing this now? [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1485.8400000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of reasons for that. But one of them is that they had a pretty clear bead on [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1495.28s)]
*  if they wanted to flip the switch and go all out against Hizballah, they'd mapped it out and knew [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1504.56s)]
*  where people were and knew that they'd know how to find them. And that is just from an intelligence [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1509.04s)]
*  perspective, pretty impressive. I'd say Nisrallah also miscalculated. The big mistake he made [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1513.36s)]
*  is after October 7th, he thought he could be half in, half out of the Gaza War. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1520.08s)]
*  They didn't go all in and launch all their rockets or send fighters across the Israeli border. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1525.28s)]
*  But nor did they stay out of it. They thought they could just do enough by launching some rockets. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1531.76s)]
*  Iran's doing the same thing now. They will lob some rockets in Israel to show that we're with [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1536.16s)]
*  the resistance, but maybe the Israelis will see that we're not going all in. And that was a mistake [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1540.48s)]
*  because obviously that was enough to provoke the Israelis and the Israelis had them mapped out. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1546.56s)]
*  And so once they made this decision, that was it for Nisrallah. But again, unfortunately, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1552.48s)]
*  we should get to this. The toll on civilians, and now you talk about this in the interview, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1558.56s)]
*  is astonishing. It's not normal. And I really worry that we're normalizing a level of civilian [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1565.28s)]
*  death that is really fucking dark. Let's just talk about it for a second. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1572.8s)]
*  I mean, you get the strike on Nisrallah. I mean, I talked about this later in the interview, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1576.0s)]
*  but it was on a bunch of residential apartment buildings. And there's probably hundreds of [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1579.12s)]
*  people dead. They don't really know the death toll yet. And the airstrikes have gone from [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1584.3999999999999s)]
*  the southern suburbs of Beirut, which are considered Hezbollah strongholds, into very [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1589.9199999999998s)]
*  densely packed downtown Beirut. So it's likely that the civilian death toll from these airstrikes [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1599.6799999999998s)]
*  will continue. But also, depending on how deep or how prolonged this ground invasion is, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1605.28s)]
*  that will be incredibly deadly as well. So you're right. I mean, the civilian death toll is [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1610.6399999999999s)]
*  already greater than what it was in the 2006 war, which lasted 34 days and it's been a couple weeks. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1614.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And I mean, I sent you Tommy this statement when the leader of Hamas was killed by Israel [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1620.8s)]
*  in 2005. And I think there were seven civilian casualties. And the US statement from the Bush [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1627.52s)]
*  administration expressed deep concern because seven people were killed. And that was George W. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1633.68s)]
*  Bush, right? The Joe Biden statement was totally laudatory when Nisrallah was killed. And clearly, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1638.0800000000002s)]
*  hundreds and hundreds of people were killed. Something is changing in terms of the degree [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1646.3200000000002s)]
*  of tolerance for civilian death. I mean, another thing I've talked about before, the reason President [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1652.0s)]
*  Obama sent a SEAL team all the way into Pakistan at great risk, not just to the SEALs, but to [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1657.76s)]
*  diplomatic rupture with Pakistan, was because he didn't want to use a drone strike that would [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1663.2s)]
*  have killed bin Laden's family. And that's not to give Obama unique credit. That's kind of the normal [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1668.64s)]
*  way of thinking about civilian casualties. And this is another reason why I can understand why [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1679.0400000000002s)]
*  some people feel like Israel's strategy, particularly vis-a-vis Hezbollah, is being [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1686.8000000000002s)]
*  somewhat validated here. From the pure achievement of all the people that are taking [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1690.08s)]
*  out the battlefield and they're probably destroying a lot of rockets and stuff. But [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1697.1999999999998s)]
*  there are tens and tens of thousands of people dead in Gaza. And the rest of the people there [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1701.36s)]
*  are in desperate, dire circumstances. There are a million people displaced in Lebanon, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1707.12s)]
*  many of them in dire circumstances and probably thousands of people dead. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1714.48s)]
*  It's hard to feel good about killing a terrorist when that is happening to people. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1720.8799999999999s)]
*  And I just don't know what that does. I don't know what that does to these societies, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1728.24s)]
*  obviously in Gaza, in Lebanon. I don't know what does to Israel to think that's an acceptable [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1732.56s)]
*  amount of civilian harm. It changes the people doing it as well as the people it's being done [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1738.64s)]
*  to. And I say that sincerely. I say that with that concern. It's just a lot of violence. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1745.68s)]
*  I don't know. I know the world's a tough place and the Middle East is a tough place, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1755.0400000000002s)]
*  but this just feels like a pretty grim time. No, but the violence tends to beget violence. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1758.3200000000002s)]
*  And if your parent or loved one or kid was killed in an Israeli strike or [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1762.5600000000002s)]
*  Hezbollah strike, you're going to want vengeance and it's going to lead to more bad things. So I [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1768.0s)]
*  do think it's an important warning. And it gets back to this question of tactical victories versus [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1772.7199999999998s)]
*  strategic victories. And clearly there's not a plan in place for a strategic victory. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1776.9599999999998s)]
*  One last thing on Hezbollah before we get to the Biden and Trump stuff. So over the weekend, Ben, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1782.08s)]
*  I just saw some edgelord fucking lefty people on Twitter talking favorably about Hezbollah, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1787.12s)]
*  suggesting that they were kind of like a noble resistance movement on behalf of the Palestinian [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1794.08s)]
*  people. And there was someone arguing that like Hezbollah's real motive is actually anti-imperialism. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1798.08s)]
*  And I just wanted to quickly stamp how stupid that is because like, let's say for a second, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1803.6799999999998s)]
*  you are just a full on raging anti-Semite and you despise the state of Israel and you think [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1809.76s)]
*  it should be dismantled. Are you also still good with Hezbollah sending fighters into Syria [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1814.6399999999999s)]
*  to massacre opposition figures and innocent people after Bashar al-Assad? You think that's an [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1820.16s)]
*  anti-imperialist view to go to Syria to kill people on behalf of Iran and Vladimir Putin? [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1825.8400000000001s)]
*  How stupid are people thinking things like this? I don't understand it. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1832.0s)]
*  Yeah. And they also did things like they've had, they have over the years conducted terrorist attacks [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1836.0s)]
*  on like Israeli tourists. Yeah, like tour buses. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1841.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. So this is not just some guys in southern Lebanon who are in some resistance [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1845.6000000000001s)]
*  movement. There's other blood on their hands, or a lot of it when it comes to innocent Israelis, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1854.48s)]
*  and yes, many more Syrians. So it's a good corrective. I'd look elsewhere for the [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1863.52s)]
*  replacement to the Che poster. That's a good, well said. All right. So our listeners, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1873.36s)]
*  Ben, they know that we're not the biggest fans of Bibi Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1878.3999999999999s)]
*  or of Biden's policies when it's come to the war in Gaza, especially the refusal by the [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1883.12s)]
*  administration to condition or cut off arm shipments to Israel in the wake of just massive [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1888.24s)]
*  numbers of civilian casualties. The story in the policy is more complicated when it comes to sort [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1894.0s)]
*  of Biden, Israel and Hezbollah, because there's been tons of reporting that said Biden actually [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1899.52s)]
*  prevented Israel from launching a preemptive strike on Hezbollah and even a strike on Nasrallah [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1905.28s)]
*  himself in the first weeks after the October 7th Hamas attack. And when it comes to this latest [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1910.32s)]
*  Israeli escalation against Hezbollah, there was this very public effort by Biden and his team [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1915.92s)]
*  to try to broker some sort of temporary ceasefire. A lot of it happened at the UN last week. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1921.2s)]
*  It seems like the Israelis did what they always do, or at least have done for the last year, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1925.12s)]
*  which was kind of seem to embrace this idea of a ceasefire privately in talks with the Americans [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1930.7199999999998s)]
*  before rejecting it publicly and kind of humiliating everyone involved. And then they really rejected [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1936.2399999999998s)]
*  the ceasefire proposal when they bombed Nasrallah and killed hundreds of people. However, the story [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1941.6s)]
*  here gets a little more complicated because Politico reported that some top White House [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1947.4399999999998s)]
*  officials were privately telling Israel that they supported ramping up military pressure on [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1951.12s)]
*  Hezbollah. Specifically, the report said that Amos Hoxdeen and Brett McGurk told Israeli officials [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1955.84s)]
*  that the U.S. supported Netanyahu's strategy to focus more on Hezbollah as a way to try to get [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1961.36s)]
*  Hezbollah to engage in talks. Politico said these conversations between the U.S. and Israel [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1966.6399999999999s)]
*  happened in mid-September. So presumably this was before the pager attack. I guess Hezbollah had [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1973.12s)]
*  basically said their position was they won't talk to Israel until there was a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1978.24s)]
*  And so Ben, I was wondering what you made of these reports. I mean, it kind of, it does, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1983.36s)]
*  you know, make Biden's message and policy here seem kind of muddled at best, though I could imagine [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1987.92s)]
*  some official believing in good faith that, you know, a Gaza ceasefire is just not going to happen. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1994.48s)]
*  We want to cool things down on the northern front. So maybe you ramp up military pressure on Hezbollah [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=1999.36s)]
*  to try to force them to back down or get into talks. But I don't know, what did you make of [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2006.8s)]
*  some of this reporting? I just, it made it even more of a muddle, Tommy, because this isn't us, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2010.6399999999999s)]
*  you know, like, let's be very clear. We are not the ones who somehow projected that the Biden [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2017.28s)]
*  administration was seeking to avoid this escalation in Lebanon. They said that since October 7th, you [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2023.52s)]
*  know, and they touted it as one of their great successes after October 7th, preventing this [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2030.08s)]
*  escalation, they repeatedly have, you know, urged de-escalation and negotiation. And if there was [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2034.8s)]
*  somebody then saying, well, maybe turn up the dial a little bit. We also know that the administration [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2044.8799999999999s)]
*  itself has also said that they weren't notified in advance of the pager attacks, of the walkie talkie [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2051.36s)]
*  attacks, of the Nasrallah strike. The Nasrallah strike happened as Tony Blinken was like, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2056.56s)]
*  announcing plans for a 21-day ceasefire at the UN, you know, on the world's biggest world stage. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2061.92s)]
*  So it, and what's kind of baffling too, Tommy, is that what the Israelis have kind of shown [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2069.52s)]
*  is that they can ignore that advice from the US or whatever you want to call it, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2075.52s)]
*  those diplomatic efforts, do things that the US has said that they don't want them to do. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2082.8s)]
*  And then the US comes out and welcomes the things that the Israelis just did, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2088.7200000000003s)]
*  you know, like the US welcomed the Nasrallah strike. The US is not, doesn't, I don't, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2092.0s)]
*  I have a question for you. Do you know whether or not the US supports a ground operation in Lebanon? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2098.6400000000003s)]
*  I genuinely don't. I mean, you watch these press conferences with Biden, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2103.36s)]
*  there was, I can't remember what it was, because yesterday he got asked about a ground operation. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2108.0s)]
*  He was like, what I support is a peace or a ceasefire. Like he had some sort of like angry [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2112.2400000000002s)]
*  defenses. He said something like a kind of one of those weird Biden comments where he's just like, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2117.2s)]
*  what I support, it's stopping, I would. But then you also get these kind of statements that appear [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2122.56s)]
*  to say it's okay if it's limited and, and it's just a lot of confusion. And the Israelis are just [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2128.96s)]
*  driving a truck through that. Now, this matters in a lot of ways, obviously it matters kind of for US [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2136.24s)]
*  credibility in the sense of like, you know, the credibility of US diplomatic efforts, right? Because [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2141.2799999999997s)]
*  if the US is getting much countries together around a ceasefire plan, either in Gaza or in Lebanon, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2145.92s)]
*  and the Israelis are saying one thing and doing something totally different over time, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2150.8s)]
*  that's clearly going to erode the degree to which people will kind of follow the US diplomatically. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2155.84s)]
*  But the other thing we should just kind of keep paying back to is that these are US weapons. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2160.64s)]
*  And when Israel is attacked in response to the things they've done, it's US missile defense [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2165.28s)]
*  systems and sometimes direct US participation defending Israel. So it's just got very strange [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2171.2000000000003s)]
*  dynamic where we're, we don't seem to be listened to. And then we end up kind of narrating what's [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2175.6s)]
*  happening, you know? Right. Yeah, and we arm them, we provide support in these, you know, times of [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2184.16s)]
*  duress like the Israeli missile strikes, which of course I support. But then also it seems like we [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2190.08s)]
*  allow, even at Yahoo, to dictate policy that's impacting us and everyone else around the world. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2194.56s)]
*  And one really important thing to watch is whether there's another uptick in attacks on US forces and [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2200.24s)]
*  places like Iraq and Syria by the Shiite militia groups that have ties with Iran. Because remember, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2205.52s)]
*  that was a huge problem a few months ago, and it seems like it's starting to pick up again. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2210.48s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's something to watch is whether, you know, in the near term, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2215.36s)]
*  whether there's threats to US forces or diplomatic personnel in the region. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2220.72s)]
*  I think in the medium term, Tommy, whether the US begins to face more just terrorism generally, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2226.24s)]
*  you know, because, you know, I'm sure this is inflaming opinion, you know. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2234.32s)]
*  So there's just a lot of questions. And I think what we do know is that this is going to play out [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2241.6000000000004s)]
*  over a longer timeframe than, you know, even the next month, that there are however long it is that [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2248.0800000000004s)]
*  Israel is really pressing this escalation, you know? Yeah. So obviously, this is all happening, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2253.76s)]
*  you know, about a month from the election, and there's going to be political implications. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2260.4s)]
*  Donald Trump very quickly released a lengthy statement seeking to exploit what happened today, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2264.7200000000003s)]
*  reading in part, quote, The world is on fire and spiraling out of control. We have no leadership, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2270.64s)]
*  no one running the country. We have a non-existent president in Joe Biden. When I was president, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2275.28s)]
*  Iran was in total check. They were starved for cash, fully contained and desperate to make a deal. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2279.12s)]
*  Under President Trump, we had no war in the Middle East. No war. Now, sorry, now war or the threat [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2283.52s)]
*  of war is raging everywhere. I'll spare you the rest of this thing. It was very long. He also [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2288.8s)]
*  weighed in at a campaign event today in Wisconsin. Here's a clip. A short time ago, Iran launched 181 [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2293.1200000000003s)]
*  ballistic missiles at Israel. And we, we just, it's, I've been talking about World War III for a long [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2299.1200000000003s)]
*  time. And I don't want to make predictions because the predictions always come true. We're not going [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2306.8s)]
*  to make, but they are very close to global catastrophe. We have a non-existent president [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2311.6800000000003s)]
*  and a non-existent vice president who should be in charge, but nobody knows what's going on. She [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2317.12s)]
*  was at a fundraiser in San Francisco, a city that she totally destroyed by the way. Very sober, [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2322.64s)]
*  thoughtful, considered response there. Trump also, the Trump campaign also released an ad today, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2329.7599999999998s)]
*  kind of like seizing on the chaos around the world. Let's hear that. Like us, China also saw their [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2336.24s)]
*  weakness. So did Putin. Then he invaded Ukraine. Hamas saw Harris anti-Israel statements and will [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2341.92s)]
*  use it as a green light to keep murdering Israelis. And Iran thinks Harris is so incompetent. New Intel [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2349.92s)]
*  shows they're trying to help Harris win the election. America doesn't need another TikTok [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2357.36s)]
*  performer. We need the strength that will protect us. I'm Donald J. Trump and I approve this message. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2363.6800000000003s)]
*  They're really doing everything they can to politicize a terror attack. Benzo, just a couple [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2369.36s)]
*  of pieces of context. First, we all remember after the assassination of Qasem Soleimani in 2020, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2373.36s)]
*  Iran fired over a dozen ballistic missiles directly at US troops in response. 110 US service [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2378.8s)]
*  members got traumatic brain injuries. Trump dismissed those as just headaches, but it was [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2386.48s)]
*  only pure luck that kept one of those men and women from being killed and there being a full war. So [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2391.1200000000003s)]
*  Iran was hardly in check. Second, JD Vance voted against the last supplemental funding bill for [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2397.6s)]
*  Israel, which included 5.2 billion for the Iron Dome and David's sling missile defense systems. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2402.16s)]
*  You might hear Kamala Harris or Tim Walz bring this up if he goes hard on this tonight at the [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2407.28s)]
*  debate. We're recording this before the VP debate. So we just don't know. But Ben, just generally [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2413.84s)]
*  speaking, I'm pretty worried about the effectiveness of this message and how people react to seeing [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2418.72s)]
*  scary chaos on the news. I am suspicious of the timing of Netanyahu's escalation. Doing this [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2425.52s)]
*  a few weeks from the election was a choice. I'm worried about the position that Kamala Harris is [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2432.48s)]
*  in because she ends up owning whatever happens in the world, but clearly Joe Biden still is the one [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2437.28s)]
*  dictating foreign policy decision. So it doesn't feel like a great setup. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2443.68s)]
*  It doesn't. Typical Trump fashion, they can't resist just busting through the truth zone. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2446.96s)]
*  The idea that Kamala Harris said something about Israel, that green light at Hamas, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2454.0s)]
*  is fucking weird and makes no sense. The idea that this was all great when Trump was president, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2458.2400000000002s)]
*  when all the same shit was going on. And frankly, I would argue that things like the Abraham Accords [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2465.04s)]
*  and moving the embassy to Jerusalem and basically totally sidelining the Palestinians lit a fuse [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2469.36s)]
*  that kind of blew up on October 7th. But put all that aside, the core message is pretty clear. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2474.32s)]
*  It's chaos out there. It wasn't this chaotic when I was president. I'm a strong man. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2482.16s)]
*  We've been saying on this podcast for a full year now that giving a blank check to Bibi Netanyahu [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2492.64s)]
*  was going to come back to bite the United States. The time to try to assert more control over events [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2500.16s)]
*  was like nine months ago, six months ago. They made that one effort to withhold one [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2509.84s)]
*  weapons shipment. And then when they got some blowback, that was it. And it was pretty clear [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2517.92s)]
*  that they were never going to do anything substantively to try to shape events and get [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2523.04s)]
*  things to a ceasefire and a hostage deal. And the thing is, that's where you'd want this to be. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2526.96s)]
*  You'd want this to be in a ceasefire right now. You do not want a war in the Middle East [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2531.92s)]
*  the month before the election. Energy prices already went up today. That could keep on [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2535.76s)]
*  ticking up if this continues. The images on people's TV screens are not about Coach Waltz [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2539.92s)]
*  delivering a middle class message. It's like missiles and people suffering in the Middle East. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2546.6400000000003s)]
*  And so this is, and I'm sure Bibi Netanyahu's timing, because they chose when to do this. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2552.48s)]
*  They could have done it six months ago or six months from now. You have to think that this is [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2559.04s)]
*  an entirely political animal. And he's seeing his numbers go up in Israel. He's seeing his [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2566.48s)]
*  political position solidifying in Israel. And he's also seeing that it's October of an election year. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2570.96s)]
*  And so nobody's going to criticize Israel in either the Republican or Democratic ticket. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2576.16s)]
*  And as the benefit of helping Donald Trump, who he'd rather be president, [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2584.64s)]
*  and this is not tinfoil hat stuff. This is how Bibi Netanyahu thinks. Any assessment of the guy [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2589.6s)]
*  would suggest that politics, Israeli politics and American politics, are key determinant factors [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2598.24s)]
*  in his decision making. And I do worry that we're in this weird window until the election. And then [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2604.32s)]
*  even after the election, if Harris wins, where you have that transition period, where a lot [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2612.56s)]
*  can happen and a lot already has, every week feels like a couple of months. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2619.12s)]
*  Yeah. Netanyahu is clearly acting with total impunity. There was a long report in the Atlantic [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2624.0s)]
*  detailed months and months and months of events and internal decision making and moves [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2631.2s)]
*  since October 7th. It was by a guy named Frank Foer who had written a book about Biden, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2637.36s)]
*  clearly got a ton of access. It's worth reading the piece because it's interesting reporting. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2642.2400000000002s)]
*  My takeaway was it was a bit credulous and didn't necessarily examine things that were told or [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2647.12s)]
*  pressure test them. For example, there's this scene where a top Biden advisor named Brett McGurk was [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2653.6s)]
*  explaining to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman or MBS, the Saudi Crown Prince, back in I think, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2659.3599999999997s)]
*  probably 2017 or 2018, the sanctions the US was going to put on him in response to human [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2664.96s)]
*  rights violations. And then it says Brett was kind of wowed by MBS saying he wanted to normalize [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2669.7599999999998s)]
*  relations with Israel and they go through this long process of attempting to do it. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2674.96s)]
*  But there's no real consideration in the piece that maybe MBS knew that this was basically his [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2679.04s)]
*  get out of sanctions free card and that Netanyahu would never support the creation of a Palestinian [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2683.52s)]
*  state. So he was not actually giving up anything. There's no real examination of the failure to put [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2689.36s)]
*  pressure on Netanyahu or cut off military support. But even just Netanyahu's posture, [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2695.6s)]
*  he's gone from at times listening to Biden, at times deferential, making changes on the margins [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2700.3999999999996s)]
*  to calling it an airstrike on Nasrallah from the fucking United States after delivering this [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2708.08s)]
*  blistering speech. From the United Nations. An organization built to prevent war. It's [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2713.4399999999996s)]
*  pretty amazing. Pretty amazing. So yeah, I'm with you. God knows what happens the next few weeks. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2721.2799999999997s)]
*  It's not good. Yeah. I mean, again, like I. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2727.6800000000003s)]
*  This is an incredibly multifaceted situation. And. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2734.56s)]
*  You know, the opportunism of going after Hezbollah makes more sense. Certainly than [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2741.44s)]
*  the kind of what they've done in Gaza. And by the way, you know, is proof of the capacity, [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2748.56s)]
*  as we've talked about, to be a bit more targeted. I think what always kind of worries me a bit with [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2754.72s)]
*  Netanyahu, though, is, you know, when something when there is a terrorist attack, like October 7, [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2758.64s)]
*  obviously, most horrifically, you know, the point is, well, this shows that we have to [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2764.72s)]
*  take military action against all these proxies. When there's not a response, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2770.9599999999996s)]
*  it shows that what we're doing is working. And so we have to keep taking military action [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2778.48s)]
*  against these proxies. When there's an ineffectual response, like Iran firing a [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2782.16s)]
*  bunch of missiles to get shot down, it shows that we have to keep taking them. Everything leads to [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2787.12s)]
*  the same conclusion. Everything is justified on like a loop. Everything justifies kind of grinding [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2791.04s)]
*  down the Palestinians, you know, like doing what they're doing in Gaza, pushing further than the [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2797.6s)]
*  West Bank, pushing further than Lebanon. And that's just kind of a that's that's an unsettling dynamic [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2803.92s)]
*  to me, you know, and the piece that then to your point, like the piece kind of doesn't, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2810.56s)]
*  you know, it's well, it's a good timeline. And it lays out kind of how the administration, I think, [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2816.16s)]
*  how they see their efforts. But there was not an enter like, like not an entertaining of the [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2820.96s)]
*  question of, well, were there other options to actually press Netanyahu into a ceasefire deal [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2827.68s)]
*  by using US leverage? You know, was this the only play to run, you know, essentially? [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2835.52s)]
*  Because it's astonishing, even when you read that to think about how much time and effort went into [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2841.7599999999998s)]
*  two things, trying to negotiate this ceasefire that Bibi himself kind of never had really seen [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2846.16s)]
*  interested in, and trying to get this Saudi normalization deal, which was never going to [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2852.7999999999997s)]
*  happen. Because even as MBS came out and said, like, well, these guys are clearly interested [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2858.16s)]
*  in Palestinian state. And so, like that to me is, you know, the lack of a kind of plan B [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2862.32s)]
*  to the ceasefire Saudi normalization piece is what kind of as time passes, and we have to make [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2868.56s)]
*  choices about our policy towards Israel and our policy towards the Palestinians and our policy [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2875.52s)]
*  to the Middle East. That's the kind of thing people have to look at is like, what's the, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2879.04s)]
*  you know, if Obama was trying to kind of, you know, deescalate with the Iranians through a nuclear [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2883.44s)]
*  deal and deal with the nuclear proliferation issue and continue to push for two-state solution, [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2888.0s)]
*  and then Trump and Biden were for the Abraham Accords as the whole organizing principle of the [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2893.12s)]
*  Middle East, how did that end up? You know, we keep hearing about how great the Abraham Accords are. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2898.32s)]
*  Well, look at the state of the Middle East a few years after the fucking Abraham Accords, you know. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2903.44s)]
*  These guys, you know, all right, I'm going to vent here for a second, Tommy. Like, you got people on, [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2907.68s)]
*  you know, Twitter and wherever still taking shots at us over the Iranian nuclear deal. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2911.68s)]
*  That was 10 years ago, you know, that was actually working until Trump pulled out of it. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2917.6s)]
*  They do the Abraham Accords and look at what has happened in the Middle East since the Abraham [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2922.96s)]
*  Accords. Like, is that solved a bunch of fucking problems? You get a lump suit end into that one, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2926.6400000000003s)]
*  too, because, you know, the Emiratis are the core piece of that, are a key player there. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2931.28s)]
*  And just there's no interrogation of this, right? Because why? I mean, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2936.88s)]
*  because if you do interrogate it, you know, you kind of get blown, you know, you get, [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2941.2s)]
*  you know, you get kicked off the panel, you know. Yep. Not the panel on Paz de [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2945.3599999999997s)]
*  the world, I should say. No, you can stay on this one. It's worth noting, too, that, you know, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2949.04s)]
*  Netanyahu went from the worst terrorist attack in Israel's history happening on his watch and [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2952.16s)]
*  being blamed for it to, you know, over the weekend, strengthening his political standing by adding more [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2957.44s)]
*  members to his coalition, getting some breathing room and some space from, you know, the sort of [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2963.12s)]
*  furthest right members of his coalition, the sort of Itamar Ben-Gabir's of the world, which, [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2968.32s)]
*  you know, could be a good thing in terms of his ability to, like, not be fully captive to the [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2972.6400000000003s)]
*  worst, most racist nationalist elements in Israeli politics, but it doesn't, makes it less likely that [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2978.88s)]
*  he's going anywhere anytime soon. I think it's clear that he has been one of the worst leaders [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2985.2000000000003s)]
*  in Israeli history. He's corrupt and racist and only in it for himself. And the longer he's there, [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2989.76s)]
*  the worse it is for everybody, you know, Israelis, first and foremost. But, yeah, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2994.88s)]
*  it's deeply frustrating that here we are. Yeah, I mean, you know, if you don't like, [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=2999.44s)]
*  like corrupt autocrats who want to roll back democracy and are facing criminal charges in [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3006.6400000000003s)]
*  this country, like the same rules apply to Israel. But I mean, I will say he's a survivor, man. And [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3011.2000000000003s)]
*  it looks like he's going to be in that position until the next scheduled election, the way things [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3017.6s)]
*  are going. But who knows? I mean, think of how much has happened in the last year. And think of [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3023.04s)]
*  where we could be a year from now. And if Trump wins, you know, like, and there's free reign to [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3030.24s)]
*  the Israeli far right to do whatever they want in the West Bank. And that is not a recipe for [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3035.44s)]
*  stability either. No, no, it's not. So even critical of Biden. I think Kamala Harris has [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3040.4s)]
*  an opportunity, a huge opportunity for the United States to kind of reset these things, lay out a [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3044.88s)]
*  different kind of vision and start working for it. Yeah. Well, don't worry, Ben. Jared Kushner [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3050.08s)]
*  wrote a really long Twitter post about how he spent so many hours studying his blow. So he's [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3054.08s)]
*  going to be on it. It's important for us to. It literally begins with him saying, I spent countless [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3058.96s)]
*  hours reading about his blow. What do you think he's been reading? Oh, wow. Congrats, you did your [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3064.0s)]
*  homework. Good for you, Jared. Fucking shit. That's the briefing books. Such an asshole. All right, [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3067.92s)]
*  that's it for Ben and I. But we're going to take a quick break. And when we come back, you're going [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3073.04s)]

*  in Beirut, Lebanon. Leila, thanks so much for joining. Hi, good to be here. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3258.0800000000004s)]
*  Can you just start by describing what it's been like in Lebanon over the last couple of weeks as [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3262.48s)]
*  the volume of these Israeli airstrikes has increased and now this week we're seeing the [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3268.0s)]
*  beginnings of a ground invasion. Lebanon's obviously been involved in this war since [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3273.76s)]
*  the 8th of October last year when all the different borders around Israel got involved after the 7th [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3278.32s)]
*  of October terror attack. But it had been minor volleys which would occasionally sort of ramp up. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3286.64s)]
*  Hezbollah was sending rockets over and then the Israeli forces in the north would send rockets [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3293.44s)]
*  back. Everyone in the north of Israel was evacuated. Some people in the south of Lebanon [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3298.0s)]
*  were evacuated but not too many. There isn't really the same kind of governmental functioning [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3302.0s)]
*  here that would remove those vast swathes of people. In the last few weeks that's changed [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3306.24s)]
*  completely. Of course, a couple of weeks ago we saw those quite incredible pager and then [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3310.88s)]
*  walkie talkie attacks in which Israeli agents seemed to have been able to smuggle explosives [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3317.36s)]
*  into the tech that was being sent to Hezbollah operatives. What had happened was that Hezbollah [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3323.04s)]
*  in the last few months had changed to using walkie talkies and pagers instead of telephones [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3329.6s)]
*  because they were worried about being hacked by Israeli intelligence and of course instead they [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3335.52s)]
*  made themselves very, very vulnerable. Of course, it wasn't just active Hezbollah fighters or [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3339.92s)]
*  operatives who were injured in those attacks. It was many rank and file people who work in hospitals, [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3344.56s)]
*  who work in administration, Hezbollah is not just a military organization. It's a political one so [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3351.04s)]
*  it runs lots of social services. Children were injured as well, horrific injuries. We're talking [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3355.36s)]
*  eyes, eyeballs removed. People want to see again their hands mangled, their intestines hanging out. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3360.56s)]
*  Really, really brutal injuries and then of course it happened the next day again with the walkie [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3368.56s)]
*  talkies. That immediately instilled terror, thousands of people injured in a shocking way [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3372.2400000000002s)]
*  across the country. Almost immediately afterwards a few days later the strikes started to escalate [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3378.1600000000003s)]
*  as well. Israel has throughout the year been in a targeted way assassinating Hezbollah operatives, [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3384.0s)]
*  Hamas operatives, leadership. What started to happen was strikes on a grander scale. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3390.1600000000003s)]
*  We were seeing strikes across the south of Lebanon in lots of residential areas, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3396.16s)]
*  then in the Beqa too and then they started in Beirut in the southern suburbs of Beirut, [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3400.64s)]
*  which are run by Hezbollah. We're talking about incredibly densely packed apartment buildings. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3405.12s)]
*  Last Friday when Hassan Nasrallah, the head of Hezbollah, was killed, that was firstly [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3410.0s)]
*  incredibly shocking. Whether you loved him or hated him in Lebanon, he was a figure of almost [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3413.6s)]
*  mythic importance and nobody really believed anyone could ever get to him. He'd run the [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3419.68s)]
*  organization for 32 years, he lived almost underground, people would wait with bated breath [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3423.84s)]
*  for every speech he made after every major event and they were able to eliminate him. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3428.7200000000003s)]
*  And in doing so killed potentially hundreds of people in those six high-rise apartment blocks [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3433.36s)]
*  that were brought down with we think about 10 £2,000 bombs supplied by the United States. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3438.96s)]
*  It's still not clear, they're still going through the rubble there and the strikes continued over [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3445.36s)]
*  the last few days and we saw for the first time since 2006, the night before last, a strike not [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3448.72s)]
*  in the Hezbollah-run suburbs but in Beirut proper, in central Beirut. So fear is escalating here and [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3454.72s)]
*  then of course last night news as the suburbs and the south were being pounded with heavy airstrikes [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3460.3999999999996s)]
*  that were shaking our hotel windows here, we heard that troops had crossed the border and that of [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3466.0s)]
*  course inflicts further terror because nobody wants a repeat of what happened in 2006 here. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3470.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah and you wrote on Twitter quote, there are no bomb shelters, no air raid sirens in Beirut [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3474.56s)]
*  or anywhere in Lebanon, civilians here at the complete mercy of these terrifying strikes. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3479.36s)]
*  What are civilians doing? I mean are there air sirens going off? Like are people have any [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3483.92s)]
*  communication about incoming air strikes? There are no sirens, there are no air raid sirens in [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3488.24s)]
*  Beirut or anywhere else in Lebanon, there are no bomb shelters, some people will go to basements, [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3492.72s)]
*  there are some hardened concrete areas but there's really nothing in the way of infrastructure for [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3500.0s)]
*  these kind of attacks in the way that there is throughout Israel, everywhere in Israel has bomb [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3505.44s)]
*  shelters, very close, most people have them in their homes now and there are of course very [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3510.16s)]
*  organized siren systems and also apps. One of the reasons for that is the reason for much of the [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3513.84s)]
*  failure of Lebanon, complete dysfunction in the government. There's never been a government in [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3520.24s)]
*  place for long enough in between the wars and disasters that Lebanon's faced over the last [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3525.04s)]
*  couple of decades to build a system like this nor have they been united enough to choose which of [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3530.16s)]
*  the many sects and which of the many cities gets priority to have these sort of things. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3535.84s)]
*  Secondly, there isn't the money, there's been a huge financial crisis in Lebanon over the last [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3541.04s)]
*  five years so there's been nothing for that kind of infrastructure and essentially what happens in [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3544.4s)]
*  Lebanon really is that the people look after themselves, that's always been the case, that's [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3549.36s)]
*  what's happening right now. So people have been fleeing themselves, they've been however they can, [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3552.96s)]
*  hitching a ride, many walking all the way up to Beirut. When they get to Beirut there are some [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3559.12s)]
*  shelters that are being organized by various organizations but many people are sleeping rough [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3564.08s)]
*  on the streets. I was talking to people today who were sleeping on the highway in central Beirut, [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3567.76s)]
*  thousands of them and people are bringing them food, they're bringing them mattresses but there [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3572.8s)]
*  really isn't anything in the way of properly organized municipal health. Now the Israelis do [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3576.64s)]
*  sometimes put out warnings, the IDF does publish warnings in Arabic sometimes about which areas [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3581.84s)]
*  they're going to strike but it's often late at night, sometimes in the middle of the night, [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3586.6400000000003s)]
*  and they're huge areas we're talking about so it's just not realistic really for all these people [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3590.2400000000002s)]
*  to be evacuating and if they do they've got nowhere to go. Right, I mean I saw the Lebanese [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3594.8s)]
*  government said that a million people had been displaced by the war, I'm just wondering are all [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3599.2000000000003s)]
*  these people displaced from southern Lebanon? You sort of answered the question, are they all going [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3604.2400000000002s)]
*  to Beirut and does the government have any capacity to help them or support them? The [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3607.92s)]
*  government has an extra capacity to help them. Firstly, the government is firstly in huge debt, [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3612.48s)]
*  the whole country is in huge debt and the government actually isn't a government. For more [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3618.48s)]
*  than two years now it's been a caretaker government which means that they're not actually allowed to [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3622.64s)]
*  enact any policy that makes substantive change, they're only allowed to sort of continue with [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3627.6s)]
*  things that were agreed by the last official government. That's because they can't get together [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3632.32s)]
*  to actually decide to elect a prime minister and a cabinet because there's so much in-fighting [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3636.4s)]
*  within the government that they are prioritising as they have for many years their political [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3640.96s)]
*  interests over the interests of the people of Lebanon. That leaves the people completely [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3644.7200000000003s)]
*  without any kind of support system. Now at a municipal level there are local structures trying [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3648.8s)]
*  to help people and Hezbollah is one of those structures, Hezbollah is a political group here [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3654.1600000000003s)]
*  that provides social services so municipalities are trying to help, that's in different towns and [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3658.08s)]
*  different governorates but it is mostly people and NGOs, charities run by local people that are [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3662.88s)]
*  doing the work. Most of these people are displaced from the south but when we say south of Lebanon we [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3669.52s)]
*  mean half the country, everything south of Beirut. Beirut is in the centre of the country. There have [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3673.84s)]
*  been strikes everywhere south of Beirut and there have also been strikes across the southern suburbs [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3679.04s)]
*  of Beirut which is the most densely populated residential area in the entire country. So it's [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3683.6s)]
*  over a million people now, it could even be more because it's very hard to keep track, [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3689.12s)]
*  that's 20% for the population and we've even seen over 100,000 people heading into Syria, [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3692.88s)]
*  Syrians but also Lebanese. That's an extraordinary detail which is there are all the reports of [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3698.3199999999997s)]
*  thousands if not tens of thousands of Syrian refugees who are in Lebanon going back across [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3703.68s)]
*  the border into Syria because they believe it's safer there. And remember just how dangerous it [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3708.24s)]
*  is for them in Syria, you know we have repeated warnings from the UN, from other organisations [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3712.24s)]
*  that Syria is not a safe place for displaced Syrians to go back to right now for multiple [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3717.36s)]
*  reasons. I spent a lot of time reporting in Syria recently as well, I've seen it for myself. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3722.6400000000003s)]
*  When we see displaced Syrians go back they either end up in rebel-held territory which is incredibly [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3727.6800000000003s)]
*  difficult, they're then trapped in a terrible economy under constant assault from the Assad [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3732.6400000000003s)]
*  government's forces and their Russian allies or they go back into government-held Syria where [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3737.84s)]
*  if they are accused of anything from absconding from military service to being in any way involved [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3744.0s)]
*  in any of the protest movements over the last 12 years to even having abandoned their country which [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3749.92s)]
*  is something that they can be accused of, men will be arbitrarily conscribed, will be picked up on the [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3754.08s)]
*  street and sent either into the army to the front lines or to jail or they'll simply be disappeared. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3758.8s)]
*  There are many people who cross the border and we never hear from them again. So Syrians are taking [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3764.4s)]
*  a huge risk by crossing back in, many of them and they must really feel that it's a safer place to be [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3767.76s)]
*  and Lebanese too feel right now that there is so much danger here, they're so afraid [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3773.36s)]
*  of what Israel is doing and the campaign that could play out that they actually think that [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3778.56s)]
*  Syria, a war-torn and oppressive country next door, is a safer place to be right now. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3782.32s)]
*  And it sounds like expats or other foreign nationals in Lebanon are finding it impossible [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3787.2000000000003s)]
*  to get flights out. For a couple of months now, Western governments have been urging [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3793.2000000000003s)]
*  all their foreign nationals to leave, some of them have. There are a lot of Americans here, [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3797.44s)]
*  a lot of Brits here, a lot of French here. For various reasons, it had become the hub [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3802.96s)]
*  for everyone who learns Arabic, who works in the Middle East, they would become the place to live. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3808.16s)]
*  People with their families, many of them have left, but there are many people who are staying, [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3815.36s)]
*  some of them because they're terribly loyal to the country, some of them because they don't really [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3819.28s)]
*  believe that a full war could play out. And it's really in the last couple of weeks since these [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3822.64s)]
*  strikes became an all-out reality right on the border of Beirut and even in Beirut. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3826.8s)]
*  And particularly last night, since we saw the beginning of these ground incursions, [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3832.72s)]
*  that it's all become very real. The United States, the UK have urged all their citizens to leave [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3835.7599999999998s)]
*  immediately on the next available means of transport. There are now no flights available [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3841.52s)]
*  out of Beirut airport for the next 10 days. That's because the Brits and Americans have [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3846.56s)]
*  booked them all up and only the national carrier is flying. And the fear here is that what happened [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3850.9599999999996s)]
*  in 2006 will happen again, which is that Israel will take out the airport and there is only one [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3855.3599999999997s)]
*  way in and out of Lebanon because of the close borders with Syria and Israel. The only way in [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3860.56s)]
*  and out is from the porch. And what happened last time was the aircraft carriers had to come and [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3865.04s)]
*  pick people up. Of course, that's only foreign nationals and all Lebanese who don't have a visa [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3868.72s)]
*  or a foreign passport are stuck here. God, it's dire. I know there is limited space within Lebanon [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3872.24s)]
*  to criticize Hezbollah, especially for the Hishia Muslim, but are you seeing any backlash against [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3878.16s)]
*  the group publicly for at least partially getting the country into this situation? I'm sure there's [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3884.64s)]
*  lots of anger at the Israelis for bombing them, but also at Hezbollah for lobbying rockets, [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3890.16s)]
*  reported 11,000 rockets into Israel since October 7th of last year. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3896.8799999999997s)]
*  So it's actually quite a common misconception. There is a lot of space for criticizing Hezbollah [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3901.8399999999997s)]
*  within Lebanon. The way that Hezbollah is portrayed in the international media, often in the West, [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3905.92s)]
*  as a sort of one track terrorist organization is absolutely not the way they are either seen or [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3912.56s)]
*  behave within Lebanon. There are wildly varying viewpoints. There are people, many of whom belong [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3918.0s)]
*  to the Christian community and many of whom belong to the secular liberal community as well, [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3923.76s)]
*  who fundamentally believe that all of Lebanon's problems stem from Hezbollah, stemming from the [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3928.96s)]
*  fact that Hezbollah did not lay down their arms as they were supposed to based on the UN peace [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3933.76s)]
*  resolution agreed after the civil war, that they did not move back from the Latani river, [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3938.48s)]
*  which was agreed after Israel pulled out from their occupation of Lebanon that lasted until 2000, [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3943.2s)]
*  and that their building of power is the one thing stopping Lebanon from being an incredibly [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3948.3999999999996s)]
*  successful Western facing nation. Many other people call nonsense on that. There's a huge amount of [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3953.68s)]
*  dysfunction within Lebanese politics. And in fact, Hezbollah, while many people may disagree with [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3960.24s)]
*  their aims, within Lebanon as a political party are by far the most functional and provide the [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3964.48s)]
*  best services for their people. Now, that is the Shia communities, but in the South, that's often [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3970.0s)]
*  been Christian and Jewish communities as well, because the central government in Beirut isn't [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3975.36s)]
*  very interested in the poor people in the South, whatever religion they are. And it's actually [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3978.96s)]
*  been Hezbollah that has rebuilt churches, that has rebuilt schools in Christian communities, [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3982.72s)]
*  that has rebuilt hospitals after they've been attacked, after there's been devastation. So [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3987.92s)]
*  there is support for them there. There's also support for them because they pushed ISIS back [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3992.16s)]
*  in 2016 from Lebanon. The Lebanese armed forces really have been handicapped by the Western allies [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=3996.96s)]
*  because Israel will not allow Lebanon's army to have offensive capability. They only have defensive [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4002.32s)]
*  capability. And that is actually what makes Hezbollah the strongest force in Lebanon rather than [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4008.0s)]
*  their own desire to have weapons. They've been able to build up weapons in Kashmir when the [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4014.08s)]
*  Lebanese armed forces have not been allowed the same from the US, from the UK, from France, [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4018.88s)]
*  which are also allies of Israel. So many people here are deeply critical of Hezbollah. They are [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4023.36s)]
*  not punished for that. There have been certain people in the past who have been assassinated [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4027.6800000000003s)]
*  or imprisoned. Right. That's what I was thinking. I wasn't a journalist murdered for suggesting that [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4033.04s)]
*  Hezbollah was covering up the investigations of the port bombing, port explosion rather. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4037.2000000000003s)]
*  So Lough Mancini was assassinated. He had for many years been an active critic of Hezbollah. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4041.6s)]
*  So I might by no means saying that anybody is allowed to go around and criticize and attack [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4047.1200000000003s)]
*  Hezbollah. But in terms of daily parlance, Hezbollah is not going around arresting people or [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4051.92s)]
*  detaining people for criticizing them. It's much more of a kind of deep level if they are actually [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4057.6800000000003s)]
*  people are actually investigating and get involved in Hezbollah's business. Because of course, we [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4062.7200000000003s)]
*  know there is potentially corruption there. There's certainly a lot of involvement in the war in Syria. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4066.8s)]
*  But in terms of daily parlance in Lebanon, people do very vocally criticize Hezbollah just as they [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4072.56s)]
*  do other political parties. And that's really how they're spoken about. In terms of their [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4077.92s)]
*  activities abroad, in terms of fighting Israel, in terms of fighting in Syria, [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4082.8s)]
*  their behavior as a military group there is somewhat separate from their behavior as a [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4086.8s)]
*  political group here. Now, of course, with Hassan Nasrallah dead, there's going to be a huge [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4091.6000000000004s)]
*  reorganization of Hezbollah within Lebanon. We're going to have to wait and see who the next leader [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4096.4800000000005s)]
*  will be. And people are waiting with bated breath for that. So the question is, has Hezbollah been [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4102.56s)]
*  so heavily handicapped, decapitated almost by these strikes that they now are almost non-functioning [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4107.6s)]
*  and have to rebuild from the ground up? Or in fact, as Iran says, as some other members of Hezbollah [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4114.56s)]
*  say, the system is so good that in fact, a new leader can be elected pretty quickly. They've [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4120.4800000000005s)]
*  actually got lots of weapons still hidden in places and they can become active quickly again. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4125.68s)]
*  So that's kind of what everyone's waiting to see. There certainly is criticism that Hezbollah has [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4130.08s)]
*  brought violence upon Lebanon, as I said, because of their refusal to lay down their weapons, [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4135.84s)]
*  because of their refusal to abide by UN resolutions, which Israel has refused to abide by as well [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4139.76s)]
*  with these attacks. But the general feeling here is that overall that whether or not you agree with [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4144.88s)]
*  Hezbollah, Israel is the aggressor. Israel is attacking Lebanon indiscriminately, as people [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4150.64s)]
*  feel here. These are by no means just Hezbollah communities. They're certainly by no means just [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4156.16s)]
*  Hezbollah operatives and Hezbollah weapons depots. We're seeing many civilians dying, [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4160.8s)]
*  at least 300 to 400 children and women already. And that's not to say that all the men that have [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4165.6s)]
*  been killed were in any way linked to Hezbollah either. We've already seen more people killed in [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4170.0s)]
*  a week than were killed in the month-long 2006 war. So as I say, while Hezbollah is blamed by [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4174.96s)]
*  some people, everyone is very focused on the fact that Israel is the aggressor here. And that's [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4181.28s)]
*  certainly the emotional feeling on the streets. Nobody agrees with this invasion, with this [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4186.08s)]
*  incursion, as it seems to me so far, or the airstrikes that are taking place. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4190.8s)]
*  Yeah. Final question for you. I mean, there's been some reports that the caretaker prime minister [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4194.48s)]
*  said that they're ready to fulfill the UN resolution that led to a ceasefire after the 2006 war. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4199.12s)]
*  Do they have any capacity to actually do that? Is that a serious recommendation in your opinion? [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4207.12s)]
*  Absolutely not. This is a nonsense. What happens every time there is some sort of event [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4213.04s)]
*  that the international community pays attention to is that the caretaker prime minister, [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4219.68s)]
*  Najib al-Khati, and the rest of Lebanon's politicians say, oh, we're going to do it. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4223.84s)]
*  We're going to get together. The problems will be solved. We're going to elect a new prime minister. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4229.36s)]
*  We're going to have a cabinet. But just wait until after this thing that we want. Oh, [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4234.4s)]
*  and actually the resolution is fine. It's not a problem. Hezbollah is not a problem. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4238.4s)]
*  Why has that never happened before? The reality is they don't have any power to force Hezbollah [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4241.84s)]
*  into agreeing to that resolution. First, Hezbollah has a large proportion of seats in parliament, [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4248.16s)]
*  so they're going to get some cabinet members. They're certainly not in a position to be pushed [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4254.96s)]
*  around by anybody. Secondly, quite literally, UN whose army, as I said, the Lebanese armed forces [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4257.4400000000005s)]
*  are just not in a position to be putting that kind of pressure on Hezbollah. Hezbollah also right now [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4264.32s)]
*  has the perfect excuse to turn around and say, excuse me, the people who we said we were created [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4269.36s)]
*  to fight Israel across the border are currently saying they are going to invade the country. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4275.28s)]
*  In what world would we lay down our weapons when we know that the country's armed forces cannot [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4281.44s)]
*  contend against that threat? So it's completely unrealistic proposition. It's an attempt to make [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4287.5199999999995s)]
*  Western leaders feel that there's still some hope for liberal democracy for these particular [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4292.32s)]
*  leaders in Lebanon, which is to the frustration of many young people in Lebanon because they feel [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4297.76s)]
*  that all these older leaders should be completely removed and they want an entirely new political [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4302.96s)]
*  class. That's all the protests in 2019 and 2020 were about. And they've just seen the death of [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4307.76s)]
*  that democratic movement and so many young people moving abroad because of the horrendous economic [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4312.8s)]
*  crisis here over the last few years. So they really feel their country is falling apart. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4317.12s)]
*  And in the end, these politicians are responsible for that, while they might not be responsible [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4320.4800000000005s)]
*  for what's happening right now with the war with Israel. They are certainly responsible for the fact [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4325.12s)]
*  that Lebanon is on its knees while trying to fight this war, cannot support its own people, [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4329.68s)]
*  cannot provide them with either the defense they need or the money they need to survive or the [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4335.12s)]
*  resources they need to survive. People here are completely without a safety net and their politicians [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4340.0s)]
*  are to blame for that. Yeah. Well, listen, Leah, thank you so much for talking with us. That's a [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4344.88s)]
*  a completely dire picture of what's happening, but fascinating. And thank you for your brave reporting [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4349.599999999999s)]
*  and stay safe out there. Thank you. Great to be with you. Thanks again, Leila, for joining the show [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4355.839999999999s)]
*  and thanks to you, Ben. Get excited for this fucking debate tonight, man. Yeah. You know, [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4360.5599999999995s)]
*  debate and that's playoff run. Oh, nice. Yeah, that's right. A lot of things. We do have some [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4367.28s)]
*  things to look forward to here. And I gotta say, these journalists out of Lebanon are really [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4371.599999999999s)]
*  impressive. Yes, they are very brave. And that is not easy place to report these days. So, [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4376.16s)]
*  no, you know, he's safe and okay over there. I will talk to you guys next week. All right. See you. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB7vr6qAqmg&t=4381.36s)]
